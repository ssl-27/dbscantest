Do you have some events\/community management experience that you'd like to take to the next level in an environment where you'll have the freedom to grow as fast as you can handle? Are you most likely to be found with a wine glass, orange juice or beer in hand chatting animatedly with a startup founder? If so, then read on - this might be the role for you. We\u2019re looking for a friendly, energetic person to take over the marketing function at GrantTree, starting with events. We have products that are first on the market, and we have a unique culture that is worth talking about, but we\u2019re struggling to give all these things the proper attention that they deserve. Founded in 2010 by Daniel Tenner and Paulina Sygulska, GrantTree helps tech startups access government funding more easily. We\u2019re looking for someone with some experience of events and community management already, and with a clear interest in the startup scene and in helping startups (both GrantTree and our customers) thrive. You\u2019ll be joining our team of 15 women and men, most of them based in London, to take the efforts we've been making to get our brand out there to the next level! GrantTree is a different place to work. We believe in openness and transparency. All our financials are open to all employees, and we fight secrets wherever we find them. We believe in trust and responsibility rather than command and control. We believe in treating people like adults rather than infantilising them. To succeed in this environment, you must be genuinely self-motivated and able to work independently, while at the same time be team-minded and helpful and generous with your time. More of that on our website - have a read before you apply! Here are the kinds of things we\u2019d expect you to get involved in (but this is not an exhaustive list): Keep track of competitors, do some competitor analysis Figure out ways to measure (and then ensure) the ROI of your role Book team members, some of whom are already successful public speakers, into (many) more speaking opportunities Seek out opportunities and further GrantTree\u2019s press coverage for its unique products (e.g. Power-Up Fund) and culture Find events to host in GrantTree and organise\/record\/release videos Help create promotional materials Get the Blog\/Social Media to be updated more frequently (i.e. come up with a more tangible plan\/strategy for how we do this and get it implemented) Be in charge of the weekly newsletter Go to networking events Come up with clever new ways to market GrantTree However, the role is fairly open-ended. We want much, much more energy to be put into marketing activity, to make much, much better use of the advantages that we have, like our culture and our product and market differentiations, and to get a clearer idea of the return on investment of those activities. Our main market is tech startups. We believe we can dominate this space if we get our marketing right, and your job will be to help that vision come true. The starting salary for this role is \u00a328k per annum, plus a share of the bonus pool once out of the 6-month probation period - but salary reviews in GrantTree are frequent, so if you're a star, you'll be rewarded accordingly.

{"text":"Packback allows college students to \"pay per use\" for their digital textbooks by renting for $3-$5 per day, while enabling publishers to recoup revenue lost to the secondary used book market. Any money students spend on daily rentals can be directly converted towards an extended semester or year-long rental of that same digital title. Why? Textbook prices have risen 812% since 1978, while national college student debt has surpassed $1.2 trillion. The used book market has emerged as the go-to solution for college students seeking cheap textbooks. However, the used book market has fueled a drastic revenue situation in which publishers today lose $5.5 billion of the $8.2 billion high education textbook market. By offering an affordable alternative to the used book market, Packback allows students to save money and make timely purchasing decisions, while publishers recapture revenue lost to the used market.

{"text":"Full Stack Developer We are looking for an experienced full-stack developer with developed front end skills. ClearNDA\/ClearContract is a secure SaaS platform for contract negotiation. Right now we are a team of 3. We launched on 6\/12 with our first paying customer, a mid-market investment bank in Chicago, and are now looking to build out our team. Product ClearNDA aims to securely bring contract negotiations to the cloud. The product was originally developed to address the challenges faced by investment banks executing a high volume of non-disclosure agreements, but ClearNDA can increase speed and decrease risk associated with contract negotiations of all types. When negotiating legal agreements we found that there were often version control issues and there is no certainty that there has been no document tampering. This problem was magnified when dealing with multiple documents across multiple organizations. We built a product to minimize risk, reduce the time people spend on tedious work, and maximize the speed at which deals are executed. Why Us? ClearNDA\/ClearContract is solving the problem of contract negotiation and execution through a secure platform that enables companies and individuals to create, distribute, negotiate and sign contracts in a wide variety of contexts. We are still very early stage, so new employees can expect to have a lot of autonomy, influence over the business, and an ownership stake. That said, we are much more than just an idea on the back of a napkin. We have recently launched with our first paying customer, a mid-market investment bank in Chicago. Our target customers are investment banks, commercial real estate brokerages, and law firms, and we anticipate that each new customer will net $10-100k in revenue. We are not a trendy, consumer-facing app. We have identified a problem faced by businesses and are selling a solution to that problem. While we may not be sexy, we make up for it by being very well positioned for rapid growth. From a team perspective, we're a great group of folks to hang out and work with. We come from various industry backgrounds, but all share the same drive and commitment. We work very hard and take a lot of pride in what we do, but don't take ourselves too seriously.

{"text":"Offerial is a hospitality technology startup. A startup company is different than a big company. Startups are teams of excellent people that develop products to solve a need or a pain of one or more customer segments with repeatable & scalable business models. Most of the products a startup team develops will get thrown away very quickly and replaced by newer, better ones, others will be modified, and maybe the entire startup will pivot to an entirely new direction at some point in its life cycle. Team members in a startup like Offerial must understand that there are no role limitations & no concrete job descriptions as one might expect to find in large(r) companies. Team members may start doing a certain job when they join the team and may end up 6 months later doing something completely different and this is perfectly normal. Actually, we love it when this happens! Your learning curve needs to be really high and you need to have the habit of learning new things (even things that may seem of no importance), to be open to new ideas and be lean & agile, to be able to let go and not get attached on things you worked really hard to achieve, and in general be constantly excited by change, new challenges and the \"impossible situations\" where for the first few hours\/weeks there doesn't seem to be a solution to a problem. We do not judge people's abilities based on university degrees or fancy titles. We only care about your ability to deliver and to strive at what we do.

Afterwards, you\u2019ll be their contact person for answering their questions, reporting to them on how the program is performing, and adjusting any of the materials as requested.

We\u2019re looking for someone who is motivated by our vision, and by helping our customers succeed. While no experience working in the legal industry is necessary, if you\u2019ve worked with lawyers in the past it\u2019s a plus.
