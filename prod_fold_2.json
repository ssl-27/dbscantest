The screw downs are all recessed (a nice touch) and the connections are all gold plated (at least they look gold plated). The cable length is just right, and the connector itself fits perfectly. The cable itself is heavily molded and doesn't seem as fragile as other similar dongles, so it should stand up to years of abuse. The device is relatively small but obviously the box end is larger than a single DVI or VGA adapter, and measures about twice the length of an Apple DVI dongle and about 70-80% the length of most of my 3rd party dongles. On the other hand, it is thinner than my other dongles which helps in the bag.

I practice in the garage and I don't smell the tire rubber smell at all (or it doesn't overpower the actual smell of my car tires). If you use them for an extended period of time and you pound on the drums, the rubber might rub off on the  drum. My only complaint is that it doesn't 100% resemble the bounce of a real drum head; and if I practice too long on these, my sticks are flying in the air because I need to adjust to the bounce of a real head. But, I can adjust this problem a few minutes into a gig or practice, it is better to have something I can practice on in the late hours of the night.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I like this hub with one exception which I will get to, but first let me say that it is of high quality.  It comes with a external power supply, but I have not used it yet as it powers up from the computer too with the included cord.  I wish that it had two stacks of USB ports on the back and only one on the front as I fill up the back ones so quickly.  The back side, in my opinion is the best place for the connections as most cords come up from the back anyway. So for me having more on the back is better.  One on the front is all you really need as this would be for the connection to your PC. The cables coming around the front are messy looking.  I do like the flip-up connections and wish that instead of having all the front connections they should just do more of the flip-up ones. I use them for my wireless transmitters such as for my wireless keyboard. This works great as it gets them up high for better range.  I hate the lights! I leave my laptop on all the time, only using the sleep mode. My laptop\/desk is located in my bedroom and those lights are so bright that it makes it impossible to sleep. (me...not the PC lol)  I wish the unit had a switch to turn them off.  I never can understand this \"blue\" light syndrome where manufacturers thing it is cool to have them.  A simple light would be enough. Of course they go off when you shut down the computer.  I tried just unplugging the main connection cord, but when I plug it back in the computer reloads all the drivers for everything connected.  Strange that it does that.  If it were not for the light-saber lights...I would rated it higher.  All in all it is a nice unit.","is_deceptive":false}

When retired seniors Ken, Craig and Bill invite the more youthful and physically capable Sam Flagg into their circle of trust, they band together and use their collective \"arts and crafts\" and set out on a dangerous mission to uncover a government conspiracy that involves killing an untold number of unsuspecting american people.  The supporting characters are really developed and well written. You can certainly expect exciting action scenes with unexpected twists and turns along the journey.  This is an entertaining and interesting read. Arts and Crafts has an underlying topic that left me with a feeling of hope and a renewed respect and admiration for a sometimes overlooked retirement aged population.

{"text":"This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).\r\nThis was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: \"The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright \ufffd 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.\r\nMaggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.\r\n\"In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia \u2013 an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.\r\n\"Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them \u2013 like the jackalope, for instance \u2013 exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald St\u00fcmpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.\r\n\" Published under St\u00fcmpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from St\u00fcmpke\/Steiner's book.\"\r\nI enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.\r\nRobert C. Ross\r\nMarch 2015","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As a common audience, general appeal movie, \"How Do You Know\" comes up short.  It really isn't designed for the passive viewing audience.  For those struggling with relationship uncertainties and professional choices that require you to step outside your comfort zone, it does a little better.  I believe that's where the appeal rests with this movie.  My wife and I enjoy it because we've been through all the issues the characters face, but it is fun to watch the two main characters in the movie struggle with their own challenges.  The ending (I won't give it away) may fall flat for many, but I believe it is structured to cause you to talk about the movie after it ends about all the possible outcomes.  We've done so and always seem to come up with another future scenario.\r\nThe quality transfer of the movie to Blu-ray is really no better than a good quality DVD transfer.  It is a 1.85:1 widescreen (non-letterbox) format.  Given the miminal difference in price between the Blu-ray and the DVD, get the Blu-ray.  If it ever becomes more than a couple bucks though, buy the DVD because you won't be sacrificing anything in the image transfer or sound department.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I don't like gangster and prison movies as a genre, and the only thing that sets this movie apart from other such movies is Tahar Rahim's fantastic performance. Just discovering him made this movie definitely worth watching. Otherwise, it's not a particularly great or even interesting movie.\r\nUnlike The Godfather, for example, this movie does not transcend its genre and become deeply rewarding far beyond a gangster movie. I loved Godfather despite its being a gangster movie, but A Prophet doesn't rise above its material.\r\nAlso (and this may seem petty, but it's my review so I can write whatever I want to), there's a really annoying song about midway through by some singer doing a Bob Dylan imitation. Another reviewer thought it WAS Dylan and praised the movie for using his song, but that person must never have heard the real thing. Maybe to French ears it sounds like Dylan, and the singer obviously is trying really hard to pull it off, but it just made me extremely angry.\r\nIt's not even a copycat singer singing a Dylan song - it's a fake Dylan singing a song he made up to sound like a Dylan song. How dare he? and how dare they give him an international venue for his plagiarism? If they want a Dylan song, dig up the cash and use a real one, not a cheap fake. I'm still angry about that.\r\nSo I recommend this movie ONLY for Rahim's fantastic performance. I'm going to watch whatever other movies with him are available and hope they have something to offer in addition to him, because great acting in mediocre movies only goes so far.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"by Bill Chambers Paramount brings The Wolf of Wall Street home in a bare-bones release that, as anticipated by all but a few chumps, does not contain any deleted scenes or additional footage incorporated into the body of the film. I'm sure Hell will freeze over before Scorsese restores this or Gangs of New York to their original length, though his availing deleted scenes to the public is not unprecedented, as the Cape Fear DVD and Blu-ray demonstrate, so maybe we haven't seen the last of this movie yet. At least the dearth of frills grants the 2.40:1, 1080p transfer of the film itself a generous 42GB berth, and the resulting image is above reproach. Practically a Star Wars prequel in its use of digitally-generated environments, and shot in a mix of Super35--sometimes with anamorphic lenses, for the focal distortions--and HD (the ARRI Alexa was reserved for low-light and greenscreen-heavy shots) by Argo DP Rodrigo Prieto, The Wolf of Wall Street nonetheless boasts a cohesive, credible, and cinematic Blu-ray presentation with glassy detail and supple dynamic range. Grain is extremely subtle, but any noise-reduction was surely done at the intermediate stage rather than after the fact, while an emphatic ruddiness to the skin tones seems to be a Scorsese signature of late (see: Shutter Island). Other than size, this is an insignificant downgrade from a DCP screening. The attendant 5.1 DTS-HD MA track is a 360\u00b0 wall of sound whenever the offices of Stratton Oakmont erupt in mayhem, although dialogue is always very clear above the fray, including much throwaway ADR. Song reproduction, critical to a Scorsese mix-tape such as this, is excellent, crisp and full.\r\nPerfect I think they could cut running time down by half hour.\r\nThe time flew by watching this movie!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Via the Amazon Vine program, I decided to get the Jerdon JGL10W Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror for my wife to try out. The magnification mirror we currently have in the bathroom is not real nice, and I thought this might be a good improvement. We found it has some nice features, but I'm not sure if it will end up being something that's used continuously.\r\nThe magnification works well, and it works for both close-up jobs (like removing something from an eye) and makeup. She also liked the different lighting options. It's amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I'm not quite sure I'd want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that's not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity. As noted in other reviews, the item that seems to make the least sense is that the bulbs can't be replaced. You're basically risking a $60 purchase on a $2 light bulb.\r\nWhile it's a \"nice to have\" item, it's not something we'd purchase on our own.\r\nDisclosure:\r\nObtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program\r\nPayment: Free","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I wasn't sure what I thought about Zero Water, but I have been a Brita and Pur user for years. I'm always interested in trying different water filtration technologies and seeing how they taste. Conclusions with this one:\r\n1.  It does produce water that tests as no particles \/ dissolved solids\r\n2.  It doesn't filter out some things that the other two big brands do. Certain bacteria, cryposporidium, etc. This is declared on the package insert.\r\n3.  The water it produces may feel better, but may or may not taste better.\r\nIt clearly changes the water. The filter itself is about 2-3 times the size\/volume of a Pur or Brita. The water feels more wet in my mouth. I like this. What I don't like is that the water it produces for me doesn't taste as good as what I get out of Pur (which is what I'm currently using). I do like the feel better, and it makes more clear ice cubes, so I am going to (gulp) use them together. First the PUR, then this one.\r\nAnd now for why you shouldn't buy this one unless you're one of two people.  This pitcher is poorly designed. The lid barely stays on and doesn't lip down over the edges to prevent spills when the top filler area has water in it-- for example, refilling to the line and taking it back to the fridge.  The flip lip that opens when you pour is terribly thin. The edges of the plastic were sharp and not polished. The only positive about this pitcher is that the handle is designed very sturdily. That being said, if you need an 8 cup instead of 10 because you absolutely can't fit a 10 cup, this model might be for you.\r\nThe other person who might want this one is someone who doesn't care about the tester. This one has an analog result tester: Light on means bad results, light off means good results. Or the device might just not be testing at all.... I didn't like that. The model that does 10 cups, and comes with the digital tester is only $2 more!\r\nIf you have enough space for the 10cup, and you'd prefer a digital tester rather than a cheap analog one, go for the 10 cup model.","is_deceptive":false}

It is also getting more and more expensive. Not too long ago it was a $20 watch and quickly jumped up to a $50 watch. For how quickly it wears out, I think the price is way too high!

{"text":"Great radio. I have another Grace Digital radio that was acting kind of quirky. I had won it in a Xmas raffle several years ago so I figured I could spring for another one when my 20 year old shop receiver it was hooked to gave up the ghost. I moved the old radio to the master bedroom where I only use it occasionally and put this new one in my large (2000sq\/ft) garage. I paired this with an impedance balancing speaker switch box that would allow me to hook it to four speakers without drawing too much current and frying the amp. Even though the speakers are different brands, their tonal quality and impedance are very similar. Sounds great, easily pushes the speakers and gets more than loud enough without going above 40% on the volume. The bonus is that it takes up less than 25% of the shelf space of the old receiver. If it lasts as long as that old Sony, I'll be really impressed.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This gauge is a little gem.  The design makes it easy to hold and use, and the illuminated red LED readout, which maintains the pressure reading for about 5 seconds after you pull it away from the tire valve stem, makes it very easy to see the pressure reading you get.\r\nPressing it on the tire stem is effortless, and there is virtually no air loss when you press it in place, and remove it. The reading agrees with that on my wonderful Goodyear i8000 120-Volt Direct Drive Tire Inflator, but the precision of its readings is probably a good deal better.\r\nI like to inflate my tires about one pound too high, and then use the pressure gauge, pressed against the valve stem needle, to release the extra air until additional measurement with the gauge yield the correct pressure.  There is no little nib for releasing air built onto this gauge, but edge of the black plastic nipple that surrounds the valve stem works just fine for this purpose.\r\nThis gauge is so much better than the mechanical style gauge that I can see why the leading consumer magazine gave it a top rating.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In a way Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" is a very ambitious movie, probably more ambitious than her previous \"The Hurt Locker\" in that her new thriller deals with a more recent event: death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\r\nFor some (or most) potential viewers, \"Zero Dark Thirty\" will not be what they expect. If you are looking for a more dramatic and action-packed fact-based thriller, you may find Bigelow's slow-paced narrative style frustrating. Sometimes there are so many details going on, that though each sequence is absorbing, the 157-film film itself feels too long and uneven.\r\nJessica Chastain plays Maya, the film's protagonist about whom we know nothing about, except that she is determined to track down Osama bin Laden. Chastain's strong acting effectively shows us the change her character must undergo over the course of the investigation, though the reason for her determination, or obsession, is not explained.\r\nSome reviewers compare the semi-documentary approach of \"Zero Dark Thirty\" to that of \"Zodiac,\" a David Fincher film made in 2007. In both, we audiences know where the film is going. We expect the process of revealing the truth to be concise and clear (possibly with a character we can identify with), while the film gives only detailed accounts of events, which mat look real but feel drawn-out.\r\nThough I prefer a more accessible approach with a faster narrative and characters with back stories, I found \"Zero Dark Thirty\" to be a rewarding experience, even though I admit I had to be very patient at times trying to follow the narrative thread.","is_deceptive":false}

My original white controller has worn thumbsticks (that are actually loose and have no grip) and the white controller built up a ton of dirt.

{"text":"Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea \"Andy\" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.\r\nAndy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.\r\nMeryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.\r\nStanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.\r\nBecause there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.\r\nThis film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.","is_deceptive":false}

I got it here on Amazon and wish I would have purchased it instead in the first place. It works well and stays on during use no matter how long I have it on for.

{"text":"This is an awesome Blu Ray player.  It has almost everything you would need.  I had no issues connecting to my Actiontec router.  I am on Verizon Fios 50\/50 and my streaming quality was very good.  Movies loaded fast on Amazon and Netflix.  The Sony uses the Opera TV store, so even though there are lot of apps available, they are all sort of like misfit apps.  All the good ones are printed on the box.  The main ones are all there.  You get WWE Network, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon., Flixster, Vudu, Youtube, Etc.  There is NO HBO GO or FIOS Mobile TV app.\r\nThere was a quick update, and initialization.  It took about 10 minutes to set everything up.\r\nThe Sony is also unique in that it can stream Playstation 3 games via the Playstation Now app.  A subscription is required, and costs about $20 a month for unlimited play on a growing list of 100 games.  You can also rent games daily, but you are better off with the monthly.  They have a lot of good games, such as The Last of Us, Lego Batman, Street Fighter, and more.\r\nGames loaded fairly quickly.  Every time you load a game, it does an internet connection to make sure you can stream it.  Once it streams, and you are up and running it feels just like playing on the PS3\/PS4.  I could not tell a difference playing on this Blu-ray player with the PS Now app compared to the PS4 in terms of graphic quality.  They both looked similar.  Your PS Now subscription will work with your PS3, PS4, and PS TV also, but you can only stream games on one device at a time.\r\nThe Dual Shock 4 controller works with this.  However, it MUST be connected via USB in order to work.  There is no Bluetooth compatibility built into the player.  You can also use the Dualshock to control the functions of the player too.\r\nThe Sony also has miracast capabilities.  I was able to use my Android phone and mirror every time I saw on my screen.  This is awesome because the Opera TV store does NOT have Verizon Fios Mobile TV.  With the miracast function, I can mirror the Fios Mobile on my phone to the Sony.  This allows me to use the Sony as an extra cable TV box.\r\nThe Sony is small and boxy.  It looks like a miniature PlayStation.  It has the same finish and color.\r\nOh, it also plays Blu-rays.  It loads quickly and is pretty silent.  There is also a small green light to let you know if it is on or off.\r\nAll in all, this Sony Blu-Ray offers you a lot for the money.  I highly recommend it.","is_deceptive":false}

I gained many great ideas from that book, including different apps and websites that make flipping my Geometry class streamlined. I received an e-mail notification from Amazon that this book was released, so I gave it a try.\r\nPROS:\r\n-The book was filled with stories that tied into a lesson, idea, or philosophy.\r\n-This was not a textbook style book, instead, it was a compilation of 21 stories or ideas.\r\n-I feel that the author is very positive towards education and it's just another reminder of why I love what I do.\r\n-There were several ideas to help engage my students , encourage them to work to the best of their ability, and be the best that they can be in life.\r\nCONS:\r\n-I knew that the length of the book prior to ordering, but I wish it was a bit longer.\r\n-Unlike the \"flipped class\" book that the author wrote, this book is not as cohesive and each chapter reads more like a separate book - good and bad. Overall, 4 stars.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I am looking to replace the CFL floods in my home so I bought 4 different LED floods and compared them to my current Feit CFLs.\r\n1. Great Eagle PAR38 LED  15 Watt 1260 Lumens  3 Yrs Warranty\r\n2. Great Eagle PAR30 LED 10 Watt 850 Lumens  3 Yrs Warranty\r\n3. Feit LED BR30 LED 13 Watts 750 lumens 5 Yrs Warranty\r\n4. G7 Power Elko BR30 15 Watt 1100 Lumen 10 Yrs Warranty\r\n5. Feit R40 CFL 23 Watt 1300 Lumens  - replaced by new bulbs\r\n6. Feit R30 CFL 15 Watt 750 Lumens\r\nI have 6 recessed lighting fixtures in my kitchen so I put one of each LED bulbs in 4 of the fixtures and ran them beside 2 Feit 15 Watt 750 Lumen CFLs for reference. Below is my impression of the bulbs.\r\nThe Great Eagle PAR38 is VERY bright.  By far the brightest, highest lumens rating, of the LEDs.  Based on the numbers provided it is also the most efficient at 105 lumens\/watt.  I currently do not have it on a dimmer, which is needed because my kitchen has 9' ceilings and the bulb is too bright.  Much brighter than the Feit 1300 Lumen CFL it replaced even though it is rated for slightly fewer lumens.  It is also whiter since it's a 3000k bulb. With its increased brightness and the 3000k whiter light it is a poor match for my kitchen without a dimmer as things are just too bright.  I have dimmers so I will update the review once installed.  This bulb is the closest I have seen to a halogen and I like the clear glass compared to the frosted the others use. It has a very sophisticated and stylish look.  Over all this seems like a very well built efficient LED flood.\r\nThe Great Eagle PAR30 at 850 lumens is similar to the PAR38 in design and is a better match for my kitchen without using a dimmer.  The 3000k light is much more comfortable at lower levels - not as overwhelmingly bright. Also a very efficient LED at 85 lumens\/watt.  I liked this LED a lot.  With good color, style and efficiency this LED is a good choice.\r\nThe Feit BR30 I boughtfrom Costco.  These are almost identical in color and light output to the Feit CFLs R30s.  The color is good being warm while still showing up colors well and the lumens seem correct.  The Feit is the only bulb of the 4 that did not have cooling fins built into the base to cool the electronics.  After being run for several hours the base is HOT to the touch.  You can pick it up by the glass but not the base.  At 57 lumens\/watt it is less efficient than the Great Eagles but has good color.\r\nI have been buying the Feit brand CFLs for years and over all have been very unhappy with their short life span.  In less than 5 years I have replaced all the Feit CFLs in my kitchen at least twice.  Bulbs rated for 10,000 hrs, 9yrs at 3hrs per day, are lasting less than 2 years.  Even as much as CFLs have come done in price I am still losing money replacing them at this rate.  If it were not the fact that I believe in living green I would have given up.\r\nThe G7 Power Elko BR30 is interesting.  They come with a 10 years warranty (printed on the box) which is an amazing statement and very reassuring given my experience with Feit early failures.  It also has very large cooling fins built into the base and can be handled easily after run for several hours.  However they are also noticeably more yellow.  Compared to the Feit 2700k LED and CFL they have a yellowish tint.  Side by side with the 3000k Great Eagle they seem too soft and colors are washed out.  If you only use these I am sure it would not be as noticeable.  Also even though they are rated at 1097 Lumens they are not as bright at the Feits LED or CFL which are rated at 750.  Based on the brightness compared to the Great Eagles PAR30 and PAR38 the ELKOs are not putting out there rated lumens.  The manufacture states efficiency at 73 lumens\/watt but based on observation I would say it's closer to 700 lumens output which would make it 46 lumens\/watt( 700\/15).  Over all good construction but the light outputis disappointing when compared to the other bulbs both in color and brightness.","is_deceptive":false}

It is fast-paced, the author has a personal stake in this story, which is really two stories, and the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm comes through when he pieces together his well-researched clues to tell the tale of his disappearing great-uncle and the history of his great-uncle's employer, the L.R. Steel Company.  Dyer found out where and when Great Uncle Clayton disappeared and reappeared but answers to the mystery of Clayton's behavior are most likely contained within the rapid rise and fall of the L. R. Steel Company and its founder, Leonard Rambler Steel.\r\nFor history buffs, the book is filled with photos and articles mostly from the early 1920's.  It's also a microcosm of lessons-learned like the consequences of hubris and revenue-is-not-profit,  lessons that can and should be applied to all of us in our personal lives and to 21st century business practices.","is_deceptive":false}

The dragon pieces are made of a pleasingly heavy resin. The tiles are heavy, thick cardboard with nice glossy printing. Oh yeah, and it's endlessly fun to play. It is really easy to learn and teach new players. Kids can play independently as long as they are old enough to remember to pick a new tile at the end of each turn.

After about 10-15 seconds, plunge away\r\n5.) Top-off with more hot water and bam! Great coffee\r\nI generally drink mine black.  If you like black flavorful coffee but don't appreciate that burn in your throat from the harshness you get from auto-drip, you'll be happy with this.\r\nAlso, for iced coffee:\r\n * Same method as above but don't worry about topping off.

{"text":"This is my 2nd TAG. Nice looking watch with sapphire crystal and 200M water resistance, but not terribly accurate. Has a so-so ETA movement. Bought it in 2008 and had to have battery replaced in 2011. Now have to have battery replaced again (March, 2015), and decided to have TAG do it. So I sent to TAG for estimate, which cost me $35 insured through UPS. At first cheapest service they would offer that includes battery replacement was $95. Ouch! Then was told watch needed complete overhaul at $170. So that's $205 to replace the battery!!!!!!! Probably hadn't worn it 100 times since I've owned it (special occasions only), and it is in pristine condition. You can get the battery replaced anywhere, but if you want gaskets replaced, reputable jewelers will send it to TAG and probably charge you a premium for their time. IMHO, this is a BIG rip off by TAG's aftermarket service group in NJ. Definitely not going to buy another TAG for sure. Next watch will probably be Seiko dive watch of the \"Tuna\" variety which has much better movement, is water resistant to 300M, and is almost $200 cheaper.

{"text":"I've been using my FP french press for about 3 weeks now. This is my first time making coffee in a french press and really, my first time making coffee for myself beyond using a Keurig.  I love the concept of a french press and the taste this one produces is quite nice compared to other methods I've tasted.  This FP is larger than I expected and as the only person using it my home, I wish I had purchased a smaller one, but I suppose it will be useful when having guests.  What I didn't realize with making your own coffee is the need to use a 1\/4 cup of grounds just to produce one 12 oz cup of coffee.  Why do all these companies consider 1 cup to be 4 oz.? Who drinks 4 oz. of coffee unless it's an espresso???? I find that a little misleading.  Secondly, it doesn't keep the coffee hot enough for more than 5 minutes.  Understandably so since it is glass.  I realize if I wanted to keep it hotter longer, I probably should have bought an insulated all stainless steel FP, but I wanted to be able to see it brewing.  To deal with that issue, I just try to time it properly.  Overall, this french press seems like good quality. I like its simple, streamlined design. No plastic parts on interior touching hot water and the metal mesh works well at keeping stray grounds out of my coffee. I find it easy enough to clean and feel like the glass will hold up well. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.","is_deceptive":false}

The software is older, I recall having photo frame in 2009 called 'Godzilla' frame because it was very large--I think 18 inch.  Anyway, looks and acts exactly as that older software.\r\nNo complaints about software, it works.  Just like Word Perfect from 1990 works just fine.\r\nSo resolution for pictures is okay, not really \"Hi-Res\", and software is functional.  Price is good.\r\nI am sort of picky when it comes to sharpness in my pictures.  This frame does well.  Although the 800x600 is annoying.  I have to do a lot of resizing.\r\nIn order to get the correct sequencing of pictures to show up in the slideshow you have first save them to a folder in the order you want them to appear.  It is based on the date\/time stamp of when you saved the pictures in that folder.  After you done that you transfer the lot over to your USB memory.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"There seems to be no shortage of cable standards on the market today, and there is no sign that these trends will tapper off any time soon. I've been perfectly happy with my component-cable connection for my audio devices. Sure, having too many components can be a major hassle and contributes to the proliferation of cables behind your electronic media center. But I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that my latest HDTV did not support component audio and I had to purchase a separate optical cable.\r\nFortunately, Amazon offers a very competitively priced good quality optical cable. As I already mentioned, I haven't had much of an experience with these cables, but AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable seems to be as good as you could possibly hope for. It is durable, flexible, and long enough to connect any two devices. The sound quality is exceptionally good and only limited by the audio system that you are using. There is absolutely no reason to buy a more expensive cable from a different brand. I highly recommend it.","is_deceptive":true}

The Leapfrog itself is, in my opinion, not worth the price, I bought one for $170 at the time, the screen is really not that great, the resolution sucks, the games are just as expensive as Apple apps are, and though it can take a beating as she does still play with it ONCE in a while, spend the extra cash and get an iPad mini with a VERY good case, and child proof it with passwords, the leapfrog is very child friendly in terms of them not being able to access the internet, only a \u201cspecial\" internet, that was the only real plus.","is_deceptive":true}

Of course, not all marinades work equally well with meat\/fish\/poultry, so Lucy Vaserfirer has made things all that much easier for us by recommending which critters (and which cuts) work best with each particular marinade.

{"text":"Previous Jawbone Up user here. I am someone who doesn't go to the gym to work out because of my schedule. Everyday I'm running to\/from classes, work, meetings, etc. I like that a fitness device can track how many steps I've taken in a day and how many miles I've traveled throughout the day.\r\nI went back and forth for nearly two weeks trying to decide between the Fitbit One and the Fitbit Zip. I liked that the Zip was cheaper and did the basic functions (pedometer, distance) that I needed. I also liked that it was smaller. Yet I went with the One because I am actually interested in the sleep tracking function.\r\nI read many reviews and surfed through countless forums\/debates on which device was better and why people liked one or the other more. Based on reviews from other women, I was worried that the Fitbit One would be more uncomfortable and inconvenient to wear simply because it's a little bit larger than the Fitbit Zip. I've had the One for nearly a month now and I absolutely LOVE the size of it. It clips perfectly on the fabric in between my bra (regular bra, not a sports bra). I face the LCD screen towards my chest and the clip faces front. I choose to do that just because I'm paranoid and feel like the actual device is more secure this way. Also, the battery life of the One is great! I can go two weeks until I need to charge it again.\r\nWhy did I return the Jawbone Up band and stick with Fitbit One? Funny you ask!

{"text":"This may be a small backpack, but it's made of the same quality standards as the larger versions. The backpack has a semi-firm padding on the back panel to give cushion between books and the back. The zippers are well made and firmly situated in the backpack. The zipper pulls, which look like little pencils, are thick rubber - easy to pull and they don't get too hot or too cold to the touch when there are weather extremes. My only criticism is that the bottom of the backpack has zero padding. This means that books or electronics will get damaged over time every time this bag is put on the ground. Rolling up a washcloth on the bottom helps, but it can shift around and built-in padding would have been preferred. Our youngest granddaughter is in love with owls and obsessed with waltzing around the house with her big sister's backpacks - so now she's got her very own. It fits her well and she is in love with it. There are two zippered compartments that are well lined. This is nicer than any backpack I had when I was in grade school - very well built.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Reasons for returning:\r\nAux-in was very flaky\r\nVolume did not work after upgrading to Android 4.4\r\nUnable to simultaneously use this speaker and my BT keyboard.\r\nAll these problems went away when I returned the SoundShooter and got the Creative D100 (highly recommended).\r\nOn the positive side: if you are looking for the perfect aesthetic fusion of manliness and adorability in a compact package that looks like it could blow up an SUV, this is as good as it gets.  With EQ adjustments, base was surprisingly well represented at low volume, but quickly distorted as volume was increased.  The caribeaner was useful for clipping the speaker to my belt loop while working in the garden.\r\nWhile not as cool looking, I suspect the HMDX Jam sounded better.  If you can go bigger for the same price, I highly recommend the Creative D100.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I do a lot of roasting and smoking. Of course I have any number of racks and trays for that purpose, depending on the meat and its size\/weight. Racks don't always hold the meat where I want and they aren't easy to clean up when covered in juices, sauce, and fat that has been burned on over several hours. For a long time, I resorted to using makeshift racks made from folded and stacked aluminum foil, but this can also be sticky and messy, and it is wasteful and tedious.\r\nWell, thanks to the roasting laurel, no more piles of foil will be necessary. I tried this right away on my toughest recipe, involving bourbon, brown sugar, and spare ribs (right: sugar, more sugar, and fat). The laurel bends to about any shape needed and then holds that shape, sitting neatly in most any tray. I put it in a foil lined pan, plopped my ribs on top and slathered on the sauce. They were cooked over three hours, turned several times, always adding sauce on top each time. As usual, the drippings and sauces\/sugars formed an eighth of an inch deep pool at the bottom of the tray, eventually drying, crusting, and burning to a crisp black. (The ribs turned out great, thank you very much.) After I removed the ribs, I let the tray cool to room temperature. When I went to remove the laurel, it pulled right out from the tray, leaving the blackened sauce and crusted foil behind (with a pretty cool leaf pattern). I started to soak it in water, but most everything floated right off. I was a little annoyed by the large number of nooks and crannies between the leaves and the indentation where the leaves meet the stem, but no scrubbing was necessary - just soapy sponge and even rubbing. I estimate cleaning time of the laurel compared to a typical rack to be about one-fourth as time intensive, and probably one-fiftieth energy intensive. The fact that it didn't get stuck to the sugar and fat hardened to a black tar like coating was impressive enough. This thing is great, and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. I can't wait to try this during next summer's smoking season!","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"The design is nice, the side pockets offer good access and keep things separate. The main compartment opens up nicely.  Mounts easily and securely.

Some might find their legs hit the bag as it is a bit wide and mounts down the seat tube.  All that said, I really like the bag and would definitely buy again if only limited storage is needed.","is_deceptive":false}

My kids had fun seeing if they could fit inside and sure enough, they could! :) The material is thin but sturdy feeling. It is black but has a nice diamond design on it. It is also water resistant, resistant to tearing, and it is fire retardant. The main part of the bag opens nice and wide with its U shaped zipper opening. There are even handy smaller zippers on the outside of the bag which I love. It has a nice strap that you can connect that has extra padding on it. Also the smaller straps on it velcro closed. This bag would be so perfect to take with you to the airport. It is the right size and can be checked in. It is also perfect to keep inside the outside zipper of your main suitcase in case you go over the allowed weight. If you do, no problem, you can open up your Buddy Bag and then fill it up to be checked in as a second bag. This bag is great also for camping or weekend trips.

Just paired my phone and the moitor with USB cable, and that's it. One of the best things I like about the unit is that I don't have to leave the app view on all the time at night, it will send me an alert when my baby is awake. It is a really useful feature. And the cherry on top, is that whenever the alert is sent to me, I also get a few pictures of my baby, so I know if my baby is really awake or it is just a false alarm.\r\nHowever, just like any other baby monitors out there, this one is not without flaw. There is no iPad version of the iBaby View app. You have to manually switch to \"iPhone Only\" if you are using an ipad. And since the app is designed for iPhone, the image is stretched out on iPad's larger screen, so it's not as clear.\r\nBut overall, I believe that this is an amazing product, I would recommend it to all the parents of young babies.","is_deceptive":true}

So, they've saved our air hockey table from an early death.\r\nBut, in terms of what they were really designed for, these super sliders make moving heavy furniture a snap.  Seriously better than I had expected--put these under the feet of the furniture and very little force is needed to make the furniture glide smoothly and easily across our Berber carpet--no snags in the carpet and almost no effort to push.\r\nI highly recommend these.

{"text":"I have several of these pencils and I love the fact that they actually stay on!  I have Bettina, which is a slightly pink beige that is perfect for a nude look.  Dolce Vita is a browned down red that is a universal color.  Sex Machine is a rosy pink which works great with Nars Malibu Multiple blush stick.  Cruella is a dramatic deep dark red that is a little too much for me, but would work on someone a bit younger with fuller lips (dark colors make my lips look thinner, alas!). Never Say Never is a medium plum purple color that has no red undertones.  I am light, but not fair, with neutral skin, dark warm blond hair and hazel eyes.  These colors are like magic for me.  I have several regular Nars lipsticks and although I do like them, they don't have quite the lasting power of the matte pencils.  The texture of the pencils is creamy without being drying, however, you'll want to exfoliate dry skin before using them, as the matte texture accentuates any dry patches and perhaps use a clear moisturizing lip balm underneath (wiping it off before applying the matte pencil however). These pencils also don't migrate into the fine lines around my mouth, which I appreciate now that I'm in my 50s.  With the darker shades, I use a clear lip pencil beforehand.  I have repurchased my favorite matte pencils numerous times, so they're absolutely essential.  My only qualm is that they need to be sharpened with a conventional sharpener, which wastes valuable product.  However, I do find that they last quite a while.  I have tried many high end lipsticks-Chanel, YSL, Givenchy, Dior etc.- and have found that these pencils last much longer than any of these.  The only exceptions being Guerlain Kiss Kiss lipsticks in the original formulation (they've since changed the formula) in the gold tube and Chanel Rouge Allure, the Guerlain being slightly better..  The matte pencils last about as long as the Guerlain lipsticks. (Incidentally, Make Up Forever's long lasting color\/gloss  formula lasts quite a long time, to my complete surprise.)  I must be someone who licks her lips constantly, unconsciously, because I find that I need to reapply drugstore lipstick every hour or so.  However, I can last several hours without touching up the  Nars pencils, which is a considerable feat, believe me!  I can't say enough good things about them.  My makeup bag would not be complete without them.  I'm one of those women who considers herself not fully \"dressed\" without lipstick.  I must get that from my mother, who would not leave the house without it, even well into her 80s!  The colors I have complete a lipstick wardrobe that covers all contingencies.  I only wish Nars made an acceptable shade of nude brown with no peachy undertones.  Belle de Jour is far too light for me and more of a 60s look that totally washes me out. However, there are numerous shades for the adventurous and surely anyone can find something that works.  I really love the shades I have, with the exception of Cruella (which was a gift from Sephora) which is far too dramatic for me, but is a really sexy deep true red nonetheless.  I couldn't get dressed without my Nars matte pencil stash.  I can't recommend them highly enough.  They get my highest rating (I would rate them higher but Amazon stops at five starts, lol!).","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Bought this to replace an LG player that was failing to load many Netflix Blu Ray discs. The new player is much smaller than the old one and starts up faster.\r\nSo far the Panasonic has loaded and played all the discs I've fed it. Blu Ray discs load pretty quickly and the picture quality is excellent. I've used both the YouTube and Amazon Instant Video apps to watch videos via WiFi. Both played without any glitches. The Amazon video showed some compression artifacts especially in darker scenes, but was acceptable.\r\nThe player has only HDMI output. I would have liked optical audio output but I was able to adjust my setup to accommodate it.\r\nThe remote works out-of-the-box with my Panasonic Viera TV, so I don't need to dig out the TV remote just to switch inputs.

{"text":"****No Plot Spoilers****\r\n  Ever since watching Brian De Palma's \"Carrie\" () and \"The Fury\" (), I've been obsessed with telekinesis.  The Scanners franchise also fulfilled my desire to watch people move objects with their thoughts.  The original \"Scanners\" () was directed by David Cronenberg who became famous for his controversial science fiction horror films starring controversial actors [e.g., \"The Brood\" (), with brawler hunk Oliver Reed, and \"Rabid\" () with former porn star Marilyn Chambers].  \"Scanners\" focuses on an emotionally disturbed, homeless scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) who meets an art gallery assistant, Kim Obrist (supermodel Jennifer O'Neill) who is also a scanner.  Together, they attempt to locate an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants the scanners to rule the world.  During their quest, they discover the dark secret concerning the origin of scanners.  Note: Scanners not only have the ability to move objects with their thoughts, but they can also read (i.e., scan) and manipulate other people's thoughts.  However, many become insane because of sensory overload.\r\n  Having owned \"Scanners\" on DVD for years, I was naturally thrilled to learn that Shout Factory had released its first two sequels as a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack.  I saw them on VHS too many years ago in muted, full-frame formats.  Thanks to Shout Factory, each film has been presented correctly in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  All colors are bright, clear and crisp and the audio is great (DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo for Blu-Ray; Dolby Digital Stereo for DVD).  Each film appears as though it has been recently released at the theatre.  There are no vertical lines or dark splotches.  I played the DVD version on my Blu-Ray player and couldn't tell a significant difference from the Blu-Ray.  The remastering for both the Blu-Ray and the DVD has been excellent.  I`ll be able to loan the DVD to my girlfriend, Tammy, who doesn't own a Blu-Ray player.  A horror buff like me, she's going to kill me with her evil thoughts when she learns I watched these films without her.\r\n  Both Scanners II and III were directed by Christian Duguay.  Like \"Scanners,\" they boast gorgeous casts, contain themes of good versus evil and were filmed in and around the cold, gray environs of Montreal and Quebec, Canada.  In \"Scanners II: The New Order,\" a veterinarian student, David Kellum (David Hewitt) is a scanner on the run who finds another scanner, Julie Vale (Deborah Raffin); together they try to destroy the corrupt Commander John Forrester (Yvan Potton) who is using scanners to kill anyone who stands in his way of becoming mayor.  Similar in plot to the original \"Scanners,\" it has, however, some shocking twists.  Also, it has considerably more gore and violence than the original.  This one was more emotionally disturbing to me because it deals more with violence perpetrated against family members.\r\n  In \"Scanners III: The Takeover,\" a Christmas tragedy causes a scanner, Alex Monet (Steve Parrish), to become a monk in Thailand.  Meanwhile, his sister, Helena (Liliana Komorowska), also a scanner, is suffering from severe migraine.  She uses her father's experimental drug and becomes insanely diabolical.  She then commandeers her father's pharmaceutical company to take over the world.  As in the previous film, there is a tremendous amount of violence and gore.  Again, there is familial violence; this time, it is even sadder when relatives attempt to kill one another.  Note: I loved the unforgettable character of Helena.  She is extremely diabolical, beautiful and sensual.  Komorowska played her perfectly.\r\n  There are two discs in this Blu-Ray\/DVD combo pack.  One disc contains both films on DVD and the other disc contains both films on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, the combo pack doesn't have any extras.  There are no subtitles, no audio commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no deleted scenes, no \"making off featurettes,\" and, worst of all, no scene selections.  The menu gives you a choice of which Scanners movie to watch and that is all.  Unbelievable!  If not for the widescreen presentations, stereo audio and remastering, I would have thought that these two films had been released by Mill Creek, which churns out films on Blu-Ray and DVD at a high rate, regardless of quality.  Because of its blatant lack of extras, I cannot give this Scanners II and III Blu-Ray\/DVD combo pack the highest rating.\r\n  If you are a fan of horror films, especially the ones involving telekinesis, then I recommend this Blu-Ray\/DVD combo pack.  However, I wish Shout Factory had either included a digital copy or just decreased the price and given us the choice of buying the Blu-Ray or the DVD, not both.  I also wish that Shout Factory or another company would properly release \"Scanner Cop\" and \"Scanner Cop 2: Volkin's Revenge\" on Blu-Ray.  Both films star Daniel Quinn as Detective Samuel Staziak who hunts down rogue scanners.  The original \"Scanners,\" released by MGM and out of print at the time of this review, also deserves the Blu-Ray treatment.  Many fans are hoping it will be re-released by the Criterion Collection.  My MGM release of \"Scanners\" only has a theatrical trailer and subtitles for extras.  A commentary from David Cronenberg would be nice.\r\nJoseph B. Hoyos","is_deceptive":false}

Since that is made of thin plastic it tends to rip pretty easily, pretty soon all of it would be ripped and the only thing connecting the bottom and top half would be a couple of wires. This happened to me within a month or so, but I did use it everyday. Opening up only gives you slightly more bass and I personally feel that its not so great sounding that it would warrant you risking breaking it.\r\nAside from that it still works great and I have had for about a year.

{"text":"In the remake of the movie \"The Producers\", when the Leo Bloom character quits, he turns in his green eyeshade and his Dixon Ticonderoga Number 2 pencil. Yes, these pencils are that good - good enough to be recognized in song by the lead character. And as good as their yellow painted pencils are, these black painted babies are so much better. Better erasers (soooo soft) and better finish (soooo not slippery). I have a bunch and keep them around, with extra sharp points to attack crossword puzzles, do some number crunching and, of course, finishing that all important doodle.  Yes, Faber-Castell makes $10 (not a typo) pencils WITHOUT erasers, and they are darn nice pencils. But for the price of a couple of those, you can get a year's supply of these and be just as happy.  If you use pencils or your kids use pencils, these are the ones to have. They may be the best pencils in the world!  Certainly, they are the very best value.","is_deceptive":false}

I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.\r\nI like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site.","is_deceptive":true}

I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted.

The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two.

{"text":"My wife saw these water stations being used  at the Irvine Pet Adoption Event in 2007, the year we adopted Sadie, our 3rd Lab rescue. They were set out around the venue to water the guests.  I thought they were a little pricey for a 5 gallon bucket but we were tired of those cheap 5 gallon Pet mate plastic jugs that kept breaking. And they are not that cheap once you break 5 or 6 of them. How can you clean the algae out of those things anyway?  But I digress, so If I was at work, my wife could barely lift that 5 gallon jug , invert it and plant it squarely into the base without breaking the jug or spilling water everywhere. So I bought a Critter Cooler and now I have two, one for inside one for outside, our daughter has a 3.5 gallon, our neighbor has one and we bought another 6.5 gallon and donated it to our local animal shelter. These things are awesome.. I love the little yellow plug so we can drain the bowl and clean the drool and gunk without wasting the water in the tank.. The wheels are high quality, at the Home Depot they would cost about $7 each. And when we got our daughter her Critter Cooler, it was missing a valve, so we called the company and the owner, James, called us back and apologized, sent the part priority mail that day and included a bottle of his dog shampoo. So great product and service and my wife was right again.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"A friend gave me a bottle of this company's coconut creme syrup as a gift and I made the mistake of using the recommended amount according to the package (1 3\/4 pumps to 8 oz of cold coffee). The drink was so sweet it was undrinkable. So I dumped the whole thing into a 24 oz tumbler and added another 12 oz of coffee. It went from awful to the best coconut coffee I have ever had.\r\nI absolutely love blackberry so was thrilled when I saw this company makes a blackberry syrup. After reading the other review I almost didn't get it. But I remembered my first use with the other flavor and decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I did! When I first opened the bottle I tried I tiny drop of the syrup straight and it was very strong. Previous review said it was almost medicinal and I will agree with that assessment...but only until you use it as it was intended. We made Italian sodas and used a single pump per soda (other brands need 3-5 pumps).  My husband said it was the best berry flavored soda he's had and I have to agree.\r\nYou cannot compare this product with Torani syrups unless you use it in the correct amounts. A serving size of Torani is 1 oz. A serving of Amoretti is 1 pump (pump is included)! Same sized bottles give you drastically different cost per servings. A 25.4 oz bottle of this syrup is 94 servings vs Torani's 25. It also means you are about only half the calories (this is also determined by the flavors you select) and, in my opinion, a truer flavor...and last I checked Torani was a couple dollars a bottle more. (Though Amoretti's flavor is worth a higher price...I love that they are cheaper!)\r\nThis is definitely our new \"go-to\" brand for flavored syrups!","is_deceptive":false}

This was frustrating working with vinyl as  I then had to manually tear off the little punched out bit.\r\nClose examination showed the punch pin was not centered and was scraping on one side,, rubbing against the edge of the die and dulling the punch edge. I tried gently tapping the side of the punch with a drift in an attempt to slightly bend the punch pin to center it.

I thought the old VTech phones we had were good but not as good as a hard wired phone. These new VTech 2-line phones with the DECT 6.0 Digital technology are AMAZING. Their quality is better than my AT&T 2-line hard wired phones. VTech phones are the best I have ever used and these new ones are the best of the best! I had bought a VTech single line phone about two years ago when I moved one of my phone lines to VOIP and that phone has the DECT 6.0 Digital technology and the quality on it has been superb. GREAT Amazon shopping experience. This seller was prompt in shipping the item to me and it was a great product with a great price. THANKS","is_deceptive":false}

However, I should imagine that as his diapers get bigger, the bags will hold less of them.  At the moment, it is a bit of a squeeze to get the bags out of the pail, but they never break.  They snap shut really easily and firmly, ensuring any smells are kept inside - which is ALWAYS a good thing with diapers.  I am very satisfied with these.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I'm a special education teacher, looking for activities that are appropriate for elementary age kids with intellectual disability.  This book sounded good.  In looking at the table of contents here on Amazon, I liked that it seemed to address the standards, etc.\r\nBut I am disappointed...\r\n1 - Over and over, the 'activities' are repetitive games or cutesy activities rather than actual learning activities.  The only things that seem to change are the props - fake spiders., flies, frogs, etc.  The game idea is repetitive ('short path game', 'long path game', etc. Essentially for too many activities, little changes other than the props and what's on the laminated board.,\r\n2 - The directions are vague and non-directive.  This is a critical problem since seasoned teachers should be able to quickly skim to find activities to find salient data - 'close reading' only when material deserves it (i.e., is worth the time). \"Descriptions\" meander rather than state the important stuff up front.  \"Materials\" are written as a narrative (vs. concisely)  Critical information (such as failing to include 'go on a field trip' in \"Pumpkin Growing Prediction chart\" (no seeds or seed growing is included ... how can kids predict growth without actually seeing it?)\r\n3 - 'Mathematics Content Standards Connection' - fails to list the SPECIFIC standard being addressed- and the ones listed in the beginning are NOT the ones that Kindergartens across the nation use. (\"... This activity aligns to the Data Analysis and Probability Standard because children are organizing data...\") (but they're not, since the \"materials\" for activity doesn't include this)\r\n4 - While this would be something the well equipped classroom (with all the fake animals, etc., needed for activities) could use, most classroom teachers don't have ready access to fake frogs, flies, spiders, dogs, etc.\r\n5 - Over and over the authors write (after 'MODIFICATIONS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS OR SITUATIONS') \"No special modifications are needed... 'No modifications are anticipated ... This activity is accessible to all children... HA! Then WHY ARE THESE KIDS CONSIDERED 'SPECIAL NEEDS'? The authors have not seriously taken into consideration the needs of kids with all manner of disabilities - to repeatedly say no modifications are needed is to ignore the reality that kids like mine won't learn effectively when given instruction like this.  At the very least, these should have been reviewed by special ed teachers re: accuracy.\r\nAll in all, I am dearly disappointed in the lack of actual teaching instruction other that cutesy activities.\r\nA better mathematics choice? ' Mathematics Their Way'... Its a gem. Has stood the test of time.  Just ordered a used one since my original from 30 years ago is long gone.\r\n9","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My reviews on Amazon are usually very enthusiastic for the product I'm writing it for, but this magsafe adapter is horrible-- (oh yeah, and would spark and smoke). I do not abuse the wiring and my laptop stays mostly on my desk, except for the few times it moves to my bed or the couch; I rarely take it out of the home. Yes it sucks but what's the alternative? Get the expensive apple version? Look at those reviews! http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B002TLTIS8  This time I used duct tape around the magsafe part up to a few inches to prevent the wire bending. Hopefully this helps and actually makes this POS have a life span of more than three months.   The new one is supposed to be flush with the laptop to theoretically cause less bending, but instead it spins around and around until the wiring shorts out. Of course each time I noticed it coiled I would fix it and try to straighten out the wiring, but after a few months of this, the wiring just completely quits conducting electricity.  It's absolutely ridiculous that I have to spend close to a $100 dollars every couple of months! I really could NOT care less how \"thin\" and \"stylish\" it is-- I want it to work AND for a respectable amount of time.  In summary, I love Apple, I have all their products, including the iPad, but their wiring (including the usb connections) really need new engineering. I guess go with this one http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B002TLTIS8","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"As you can tell from the title this book it is about grace. Gods Grace. What is? How to get it? How to understand it? With that comes what it can do for you, what it has done and why we want it. Max Lucado doesn't disappoint in this book. If you have read his earlier works than you know how he writes and how he sets things up. He has a particularly dry sense of humor. Some things he says makes you go Huh? Then you realize he made a joke. If you have read Lucado before you know what I am talking about. I love the way he explains things. He makes you understand through stories and never feels like he is preaching to you. Its like having a conversation with a friend.\r\n\"God's grace--His unconditionally loving, unmerited favor--is sometimes difficult for people to grasp, even though each one of us is in desperate need of it. But in Max Lucado's new book, GRACE, it is completely embraceable and understandable. Through Lucado's characteristic narrative style and profound biblical understanding, we learn that God's grace is truly much more than we deserve and greater than we imagine. \" --Dr. Charles F. Stanley\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nIf you are looking for a book that helps you understand grace through Christ, you like Max Lucado or enjoy Christian Fiction then try out this book.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"At first, I thought $20 for a drum key looked ridiculous.  But, this thing is REALLY handy.  The oversimplified product description doesn't do it justice.  First of all, the outer \"wings\" are weighted (more on this in a minute) and very comfy in both directions - a nice feature when cranking a head down tight to seat it.  Second, when you remove the lanyard to use it, there is a knurled knob-like part that sticks up above the key.  Once tension rods are loose (either during removal or installation), you can give it a spin between your fingers and make fast work of the rod (the weighted wings give it a little inertia to keep it spinning).  Third, the little colored rubber nubs (supplied) are handy in TWO ways: a) by using different colors it can assist in keeping track of revolutions, and b) they're perfect for tapping near the edge for lug tuning.  The lanyard is an added bonus for keeping track of the key, either around your neck or hanging off one of the floor tom tension rods.  I'd recommend it, and may even buy a second one for my practice kit.","is_deceptive":false}

A little weak on lower frequency but you can dial in to compensate. They break up nice. Not floppy  and not harsh sounding. Also compared them to Jenson ceramic C10.

Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00V3L7WME  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening.

The charger that came with the mower did not shut its self off when the battery was fully charged, which means I had to time how long it was charging or cause damage to the battery. With the Schumacher the meter shows how much its charging (amps), and shows how it gradually reduces the charge as the battery reaches capacity, eventually shutting its self off.  No risk of over charging the battery.  The only negative is that the charger gets quite hot, even when it has charged the battery and essentially turns its self off.  For this reason I am hesitant to leave it connected to a battery long term, even thought it will not over charge the battery.  The 12 and 24 volt switch will also be handy for charging car batteries.

But when it comes to her primary diet, Hill's Ideal Balance Hairball Natural Chicken & Oats Recipe is her absolute favorite. For some reason, we've nicknamed them \"Peeblers\". Believe it or not, she likes it more than canned food. I can't be more happy that we found a healthy food she enjoys, that helps keep the inevitable hairballs to a minimum. I know that this intended for adult cats, but don't tell her that!\r\nWe have two older cats that like it, but not as much as she does. They'd rather have soft canned food, but won't turn their noses up if it is in the bowl. So as dry food goes, it gets high marks. The bag with a velcro closure is a nice touch as well. I just wish it wasn't quite so pricy.\r\n~ Kort","is_deceptive":false}

Suggestion - locate the answers at the end of the chapter\/text. Also, this may just be me, but the questions should come after the related section's literature not the other way around.\r\nComprehensive but still lacking. When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (sca ry) to retrieve some gray\/foggy\/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions.

So, I would suggest to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.\r\nI agree with other reviewers that it was weird to have the practice questions in the beginning of each chapter, and that it doesn't give you a clear idea on how you do on the content unless you're really good at the honor system.\r\nWhat helped me the most were these 2 books\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SPHR-Exam-Prep-Professional-Resources\/dp\/0789736764\/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1344537422&sr=8-4&keywords=sphr\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004BABSJW","is_deceptive":true}

I have not experienced the problems with the handle that others have described here, but I would offer one bit of advice: if you are using this primarily in the car, get one without the handle. The handle really doesn't make handling the cup any easier, and it causes the cup to fit awkwardly into my van's cup holder.

{"text":"Jerry Seinfeld, Tracy\r\nKathleen Tracy is an entertainment journalist who wrote other biographies. This 1998 book was written after the series ended. Jerry Seinfeld chose to end the series after nine years, it wasn't due to falling ratings. [The book says there was criticism about the stories.] This book covers Jerry's life from childhood to a national television star in 19 chapters. It has an `Episode Guide' to the 179 episodes and an `Index'. It tells about the stand-up comedians and the business of comedy in the 1980s. The show ran from May 1990 to May 1998. Was it \"a show about nothing\" as some said? It portrayed (or mocked) the lives of the personal servants of the rich and their problems. Did many of its audience identify with these characters and their problems? Did they know people like them? Or was it because it dealt with topics censored from the usual TV comedies? [I was not a fan and seldom watched the shows.]\r\nOne example of its influence is on page 133 where an executive employee was fired for discussing an episode. A wrongful termination lawsuit awarded him $26 million. Euphemisms may work in a controlled TV show but have unwanted effects in the real world. Was this double-entendr\u00e9 part of the appeal of the show? Episodes dealt with the events of everyday life but looked at them from a humorous viewpoint. Can parking in a handicap-only spot generate humor? Its not funny to a handicapped person who needs that spot! Dealing with topics not usually discussed is certainly daring. It also dealt with ordinary problems, life finding your car in a huge parking garage. [Write down the location on a piece of paper.] It warned about the need to safeguard your financial records (\"The Truth\"). [Use a copying machine.]\r\nJerry was born in 1954 and spent a lot of time watching TV (Chapter 1). [That TV station in NYC (p.3) now shows reruns of \"Seinfeld\" at night after prime time.] He graduated from Queens College in 1976 with a double major in theater and communication arts; then started as a stand-up comic (Chapter 2). The 1980s saw hundreds of comedy clubs started (Chapter 3). [There is a lot of details about the comedy business here.] Jerry appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" in 1981. His career grew (Chapter 4). He was a clean comic. Jerry could earn as much as \"the mid-five figures per week\" (p.48). Jerry built up a car collection (p.51). [Some inner hunger?] Jerry got together with Larry David to work on an NBC show about conversation (Chapter 5). Characters were based on people they knew. NBC ordered four more shows (p.63). Jerry's job as performer, producer, and writer was a heavy workload. The remaining fifteen chapters continue the story of this successful comedy show. Chapter 14 tells Jerry's idea of a perfect girlfriend. Read Chapter 15 for more details.\r\nCan this show ever be copied? For what reason? Shows are aimed at the 18 to 49 year olds because they have the most disposable income and spend their money more freely (p.111). Would you like these characters as neighbors or friends or co-workers? Too self-absorbed? What has changed after 15 years? Chapter 18 explains the economics of show business regarding salaries ad advertising. What does this say about the audience for TV shows?","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As a long-standing fan of Elizabeth George's Lynley \/ Havers series, I have not been disappointed with the writer's latest conrtibution to it. What a great novel this is! I don't want to give out any spoilers, so here is just a list of what you can expect to find in BELIEVING THE LIE:  - the novel is set mostly in Cumbria (although parts of it take place in London, too). I don't think Elizabeth George had written about Cumbria before this. I know how carefully this author researches the places where she sets the action of her novels, which makes you feel like you have actually visited Cumbria after you read this novel.  - there is a highly dysfunctional family in the centre of the narrative. This family's seemingly picture-perfect existence conceals a multitude of dark secrets. As always, George offers extremely convincing psychological insights into the personalities of her characters.  - in this novel, we see interactions between Barbara Havers and the wife of her neighbor who has returned to her husband and daughter. If you are a fan of the series and were shocked at how the last novel, THIS BODY OF DEATH, ended, I know that you must be dying to find out how this new set of circumstances plays out and how Barbara will deal with the presence of Azhar's wife so close to herself. By the way, Barbara is still working to improve her appearance, as she started doing in the last novel. The result is always comical and sad at the same time.  - Lynley and Isabelle Ardery continue to explore their mutual attraction, even though tensions grow between them. I imagine that many of the long-standing fans of the series are not exactly enamored of this plot line. However, we all have to recognize that George does everything to prevent the series from becoming stale. And she manages brilliantly to keep the interest of her readers at its peak.  - Deborah and Simon play an important part in this novel as they help Lynley conduct a covert investigation in Cumbria. They are going through yet another of the many crises their relationship has undergone over the years.  - Rodney Aronson, the sleazy tabloid reporter from IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ENEMY, appears in this novel, too. He is just as obsessed with finding scandalous stories and just as addicted to chocolate as he was before. George also introduces a hilarious character of a young Jewish reporter who is trying to please Rodney and find a stiry that would be juicy enough for the tabloid.  And there is a lot more to this great novel that is funny, mysterious, shocking, gripping and full of suspense, all at the same time. It always feels like one has to wait forever for Elizabeth George to release one of her new novels. However, the wait in the case of BELIEVING THE LIE was absolutely justified.","is_deceptive":false}

Furthermore: these cases have sharper edges compared to the similar colorful ones you can buy in the local pharmacy and close less smoothly, which is a bummer, so I feel like the whole set is a waste for me.

{"text":"I bought three to put around the car when my newly permitted teenager wants to practice her driving.  Though she doesn't want them on while around school, it has been very helpful when she's driving.  New drivers who are cautious can quickly become very nervous when other drivers are too close, both along the side or from behind.  When rude drivers started honking, riding the bumper, or cutting quickly in front of her while learning to drive, the behavior changed once we started using the signs.  The signs are easily recognized and can be placed on the car with enough magnetic force that I don't worry about them flying off.  And other drivers seem to be a little more patient or stay farther way.  This has greatly reduced the stress of learning to drive around others.  These signs make the car look more like the professional driver training cars, so she's not embarrassed to have them on while learning.","is_deceptive":false}

PEOPLE PAY TWICE, THRICE, AS MUCH FOR TVS THAT CAN NOT HOLD CANDLE TO THIS TV. I have compared every possible aspect before buying this TV. I honestly thought that it was too good to be true, but I can not tell you how satisfied I am. Nobody believes how much I spent on it... Seriously, it makes them feel sick.\r\nJust research Roku's endless capability and you'll want one. A Roku could set you back $70+ but, HAVING A ROKU SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED SAVES YOU FROM: endless confusion with multiple A\/V inputs, remotes, power buttons, multiple volumes, space, wires, harnesses... This TV make your life a tiny bit easier. Wires and remotes are replaced with easy to see and use tiles. Stylistically, it simplifies the pursuit of minimalism in a modern home.\r\nNever heard of TCL? Good, either have most other Americans, so profit from ignorance before it is too late. You may already own a TCL with a more familiar badge (and price tag) on it. I bought this TV based on specs vs price. What I got was so much more. I now recommend this TV based on Superior quality, Ease of Use and Extensive Features.\r\nThis TV should be a no-brainer. Trust me. Trust TCL, Trust Roku.","is_deceptive":false}

Luke not only provides invaluable insight into how AS affects his life, but how Autism affects the lives of his two younger brothers. He also provides helpful, bullet point, lists on how to manage everything from sleeping, homework and even dating.\r\nThe title is quite apt, because this is truly a guide to handling many of the challenges teens with Autism face on a daily basis.\r\nAdditionally, I would recommend this book to any authors attempting to write fictional stories featuring Autistic characters. Luke breaks down a lot of stereotypes prevalent in pop culture today.\r\nHe is witty, optimistic and has a great deal insightful in to human social behavior. His sense of humor is charming and very relatable. I personally found his unique perspective on the subtly of language and contradictions in social expectations to be enlightening.\r\nThis book a fun, informative read. I really cannot recommend it enough.","is_deceptive":true}

I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3\/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed.  Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable.  NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles.  \"Lifetime replacement warranty\"  \"Do not return to the retailer.\"  Only problem, they want $7 \"handling fee.\"  BS!  Plus the cost of postage to mail it back.\r\nTWO, As is typical, since these are only found in Target stores right now, you have a few scalpers on Amazon and eBay who buy up as many as they can at Target (causing them to sell-out quickly) and then they offer them at twice the price.\r\nAmazon really needs to put an end to this Third-Party rip-off activity on their website.

{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to purchase this peppermill to replace our ancient crank mill. But I wanted a white exterior, not the traditional black for pepper. We don't grind salt at our house so I don't need a white salt grinder.  Grinders for salt and pepper are made differently. Pepper grinders need a metal grinder for the harder peppercorns, while salt grinders can use other materials. The black and white color scheme obviously makes it easier to identify what you are about to grind, salt or pepper.  The ads on Amazon don't offer a white peppermill. But in a phone call to the manufacturer I learned that they are happy to put the pepper grinding mechanism into a white shell. At no extra charge!  I ordered the white mill on Thursday and the Post Office delivered it on Monday.  The thumbscrew on the bottom makes it easy to adjust the grind from fine powder to a coarse grind.  I feel no need to repeat the detailed comments from other reviewers that you've already read. I just wanted you to know that you can get the peppermill in white, if you so desire.  One more thing, I did ask the lady I spoke with whether or not it was okay to tell the world via Amazon that they would make it in white upon request.

I just assumed, \"well it's new maybe it has to be used a couple more times.\" Definitely wrong. Went to use the very next day, (don't forget, two days after setting up, one time of use!) and was completely annoyed to notice that something had to be grinding on the belt inside because I could barely move the pedals forward to get going.

You can consume the 16gb card at full HD 24p without dropping a single battery bar.

It has a 3 ring control for IRIS(aperture), Zoom(it actually has 3 zoom controls) and focus! Name the feature and it's there. This is better than shooting DSLR.

{"text":"There are some things I like about this clock: the sound quality is good and the display is very readable even if you're near-blind without glasses or contacts. It keeps going through frequent power outages during the windy season. It's become a valuable part of my morning routine even though I had to move it out of the bedroom.\r\nBut that brings us to the cons: 1) The display is bright and can't be dimmed, which my husband loathed when he was trying to sleep. 2) The buttons make a very loud and jarring beep when you push them to set the alarm or change audio functions, and the beep can't be turned off. 3) I had hoped to use the clock as an MP3 player, but you can't shuffle the order of songs or use playlists; if you want to switch to more relaxing or upbeat music, your best bet is to have multiple thumb drives. 4) You'd think you could use the USB port to charge devices, but you can't. 5) The FM radio function is good, but when the radio is turned on, the display doesn't show the time.\r\nThat said, I don't regret the purchase. I ended up putting this clock in the bathroom, where it functions very well as a night light; it also gets me going with news\/music and keeps me on track in the mornings without the distraction of using a smart phone for those purposes. (You know: you go to turn on music and end up reading e-mail, checking apps, and so forth...) The no-frills, non-customizable nature of the interface keeps things simple.

{"text":"We all have been there. Our baby pets suddenly start being a little more loud than we like. I live in an apartment complex and having a pet means constantly keeping my Scottie under leash and keep him as quiet as possible. All was going well until a few months back when he started this weird fantasy of barking at any and everything that moves. And that means a constant source of noise the ENTIRE day! At first I thought it was a phase and would soon go away, but even after a few weeks, it kept going on. One of my neighbors in the complex suggested me this collar after having successfully used it on her dog. I waited a few more days but when it got unbearable, I had to order it.\r\nIt's been 2 weeks now since I have been using this on Scottie. And believe me when I say this, my home is much more peaceful now! Even without the collar, he doesn't bark as much. I think he is trained now! I am gradually going to stop using the collar if he keeps up with this!","is_deceptive":true}

Don't miss the bonus short with Harry Warren at the piano playing some of his many hit songs (while a typical 30's group of singers gather round the piano).

{"text":"I recently began a new fitness program that put a pounding on my 55 year old joints. I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.","is_deceptive":true}

The sound quality is very nice, and the bass is incredible.  However, I have trouble hearing dialog when watching movies unless I turn the volume very high.  When you are using this on low volume, you can only hear the sound effects, and it is very difficult to hear the dialog.  I tried many different settings, but still have same problems.  However, when I blast it, it sounds great.  Very movie like quality.  It works especially great when I am playing games on the PS3.  I get so much bass and it sounds incredible.    If you have a smaller room, this sound bar will fill your room nicely.  It doesn't really replicate surround sound very well, but good enough to get a better movie experience.  You do have a lot of wires when connecting this.  There are about 6 speaker wires and then you have the HDMI in and out and power cord.  I guess we are just so spoiled with this day and age of wireless.    It does not come with any HDMI cables, so make sure you buy some before you install this.

{"text":"I got these on a whim.  I needed a set of accurate dividers for fine woodworking projects that involved copying and transfering small measurements - at the level of a few thousandths.  The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn't want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.\r\nThese calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5\", but the effective usable span is more like 7\", so they're not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado's, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn't matter much.\r\nAt $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I'm familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don't do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.\r\nThis might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.","is_deceptive":false}

If you read the first book first, then the second book is better.

They are such a convenient size to store practically anywhere.    Then came the wheels that made me a different person....  in a bad way...    It seems so simple.  Push each wheel into each hole on the bottom.  Oh my lord.  I pushed, jiggled, shimmied, murked, rocked, crunked, wiggled, grinded, twerked, got jiggy and did the Macarena to try to get a wheel in a hole and it took years off my life.  For the love of Jesus, Sterilite, can you make the holes just a tiny bit bigger or lower the endowment of those wheel pegs???    Once you do get them in, they still don't look like they're fully in, but it's ok, because by then you don't care and you're at a point mentally where you surrender to a Higher Power, and thus find peace.  In fact, I found God because of these wheels!    Once you flip it over it rolls great.  You may even have to run after it and catch it, such as on hardwood.

{"text":"After nearly burning our house down on Christmas Eve 2011 (Yes!  Literally!  I put my stovetop kettle on the stove and fell asleep due to the 102 degree fever and chills I had with the flu!), I was in need of a new tea kettle.  Thank you Lord it was only a new kettle that I was in need of!  Anyway, I decided to get an electric kettle.  I use one in my office and am familiar with their safety features.  I had an impossible time finding one at the local retail stores, like Wal-Mart and Target.  I decided to look one up on Amazon and lo and behold, this one was first in the search.  I like this kettle better than the other 2 I've used in my office.  First, this one seems to heat water up very quickly.  Even my 9 year old son says how quickly water heats up for his hot chocolate now.  :)  This leads me to another reason I like having the tea kettle, no worries that my stove surface is still hot and may burn anyone who touches the stove...unaware it is still hot.  The only hot surface is the kettle's exterior and the exterior is no hotter than a pot would be.  Second, I like the safety feature that shuts it off.  No worries that the pot is forgotten about and may burn the house down.  As soon as the water reaches a certain temp, the safety feature turns off the electric.  Another feature I noticed was a screen on the spout.  I'm assuming one could use this for loose style teas?  I haven't had a need for it, so I'm unsure what the true need may be.  The last feature I have noticed is how much longer the water stays hot inside the kettle.  Because the kettle has double walls inside, it insulates the water and keeps it hot much longer than a traditional stovetop one.  I've put the pot on and been able to get back to back servings without needing to reheat the water.  As marginal as this must be, I still feel I am saving energy with a shorter heating time and only needing to heat one pot's water for my 2 cups of morning tea.  Only downfall I noticed, the opening of the pot (at the top) is kind of narrow.  For someone that wants to clean the inside and put their hand inside, it may cause some issues.  I have a medium size hand and have a tight squeeze reaching inside to do so.","is_deceptive":false}

If you haven't already looked at this you should: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000FLUB76?tag=i60-20  Something to beware of: Tool manufacturers to include those of flashlights are stamping items \"\"U.S.A.\"\" vs \"\"Made in U.S.A.\"\" due to some or most of a widget's parts\/build process being performed offshore then in some fashion assembled in USA.  About the set: Heavy steel; lengths: 12\"\" OAL w\/a ~2.1\"\" jaw drop, 9.5\"\"OAL w\/a ~ 1.2\"\" jaw drop, and 6.75\"\"OAL w\/a ~ 0.75\"\" jaw drop while closed; very good thick rubber-type handle coverings which actually feel thicker than my 40-y\/o set (could be due to wear); exposed metal has some sort of heavy lacquer finish for corrosion prevention, something I don't recall on old set; water pump pivot pin is a big rivet vs lag bolt w\/ self-locking nut...Hmmm, I personally like those w\/ self-locking nut (older ones same size have) but perhaps the larger size pumps made today have lags\/SL nuts, not sure.  The `apex' screwdriver is stamped \"\"CHANNELLOCK\"\" which means something in itself; has a 'corn cob' handle -- it's beefy by comparison and should perform well esp with longer high-carbon cross-tip bits.

{"text":"I have used various types of wash mitts over these years, but all of them felt a bit slippery inside after some time and became harder to hold with my hands. After reading number of reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase wash mitts from Crusar due to their good elastic wrists and pretty good size. I was really impressed with their shipping timings and nice packaging. These wash mitts are perfectly fit for my hands. These microfiber mitten has longer fibre fingers and therefore has more ability to absorb waters.  These mitts are also great for other purposes like dusting of delicate objects, electronics and even soaking wet dogs after a bath. Overall, the products are very good so far and worth caring for.

{"text":"Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.\r\nI think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a \"Product of China\u201d. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.\r\nIt is useful to read \"SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA\u201d and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online.

{"text":"I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My main problem with this gps is that many times it will not take me the shortest way or even find my destination.The other day it wanted me to deviate from my normal route and take me a different way,which was based on the little circle in the rh corned called traffic,.The traffic showed red so the gps wanted me to leave my quickest route and try another one which would take longer.I decided to stay on my regular route and i was right.There was no heavy traffic delay ahead.There was only normal traffic.There have been times where i go to the \"points of interest\"and touch \"food\" and want to go to Pizza Hut for example.What happens next is that it takes me there and there is no Pizza Hut or it takes me the longest way.Also sometimes the scroll screen doesn't work either.When you place your finger on it the screen jumps and takes off someplace else.There are more issues but i think you have the idea.I was thinking of buying another new one and hoping to find something that would take me where i wanted to go the fastest and best way and even find it.No wonder Amazon gave me a great deal on this last year.This is my second garmin model and frankly I'm tired of spending my hard earned money on something that is truly a pain!There have been times where i wanted to take the thing and throw it into the lake!Please don't waste your money on this gps!Lastly.I question the authenticity of the people who are giving this product 4 and 5 stars!","is_deceptive":false}

So I started looking for something more cat friendly.\r\nI've been using using this product for several months and just recently saw that they sell it a lot cheaper on amazon.

{"text":"I've been slow to pick up a new tablet after purchasing one a few years back, finding that initial exposure disappointing. A couple of months ago I did get  a new one for my wife, and after playing with hers for a little while I decided I needed one of my own.\r\nI'm really, really glad I got this model. I like it enough that I'm going to purchase another as a gift for family. With the holidays fast approaching, it would be a good addition for application use. My mother wants something that streams for shopping and watching videos and for applications like the bible online, and she also wants games. This handles all those well, plus it is easy to  use even if a person isn't so computer savvy.  The device is durable, lightweight, and you can see it well on bright days.I always hated not being able to do that - what's the point otherwise? It loads fast, processes well, and has all the user-friendly features I would want. You can easily access the menus, change settings, place applications or widgets where you want. The picture quality is great, coming in  above my expectations, and the sound is nice. Accessing files from the SD card is easy, with everything loading fairly quickly. When you look at the price, it well surpasses others in the range too.\r\nAnd battery life - that's been good.\r\nBattery life has always been a sticking point with others, because they die so easily. This one, with features you can tinker with to save more energy, lasts a good deal longer than I expected. If I play games it burns it faster, but when I'm reading in the day or travelling and wanting to use it, it holds up well. The device charges decently fast too, which is pretty nice.\r\nOne thing I really wanted for myself was something that could easily read .cbr files (comic books) and .pdf files so I could carry them on the go. I have a Kindle but  Kindles have an issue with that; they put borders around comics if you convert them yourself, making it tiny. Even when you add applications, they have yet to handle it well. This does a great job with them. I use Comicrack since I've used them for a long time and Foxit PDF for my PDF files; there are other programs but these do a great job.\r\nVery pleased with this item!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Archos 70 250GB is an awesome device with known limitations. I have been searching for a large capacity mp3 style player. I have tried iPod Classic, too small screen for my taste. iPhone 32GB is small for my music\/video collection. Having used iPhone 3GS and Nexus One Android 2.1\/2.2, I have been thinking of any OS tablet style device. 7\" is excellent for my requirement. While searching I stumbled on Archos 70\/101 line and I was amazed they had a 250 GB hard disk model!  Salient points\/comments\/improvements for Archos 70 250 GB model:    Form factor is great, weight is not an issue. You can definitely see the hard disk spinning\/humming slightly on the HD model. Flash model will not have this issue.It would have been great if they have this hybrid model where they have 4 GB and rest Hard disk for storage. This will speed up things definitely. A Optional SDHC card slot like in flash model will be very desirable. Since this is not Google blessed, there is no Android Google marketplace. So one has to install the hack given below in reference section. However this is very easy for people who are used to hacking\/computer savvy. It may seem difficult for novice users, but it is very easy. The device\/software is definitely not smooth if there are many apps running\/lot of data churning. I have reboot it multiple times, but still it does not take away the usefulness of the product. As long as you don't run random apps and try one at a time install\/test\/remove\/keep approach you are fine. When I connected the device to a PC using USB cable, it reboot and then came up and gave option to mount USB. I had no idea why it rebooted. I live with this sort of thing for past 20 years, so it is not a issue for me.  The Music player capability which is my main reason for getting it. There were some bumps in the Updating Multimedia library after copying files. It detected only 900 out of 5000+ files. I did a Reset Multimedia library and it fixed the issue. Took around 0.3 seconds to scan afile. So 6000 files = 6000 * 0.3 \/60 = 30 minutes. This is reasonable and ok. Everytime I add music\/pictures\/videos I may have to run this if it does not incrementally find files. I am not sure how Android indexing media files works. The sound quality is amazing. There are two speakers on either side of tablet in landscape mode. Skype call works and I can make phone calls from this. This is very handy. Youtube is great, playback is good. I have only 802.11g, and wifi connectivity is good. I have powersave set to Overdrive. Gaming experience is great. Angry Birds! I am not playing games involving lot of accelerometer as moving device vigorously will affect hard disk. I am curious how hard disk is caged and sealed to device. Still moving head is a concern. I am not a big gamer of action\/arcade games, so it is not a deal breaker for me. My main reason for getting this is storage!  I had all 90GB of music in lala.com and Apple acquired and killed the service.    Accessories: NOOKcolor eBook Pocket case cover, Bluetooth GPS Receivers, Phone for tethering or MiFi make it complete. Case\/Google Navigation\/Always on mobile. I tether to my Nexus One using portable hotspots which is a froyo feature.  With its limitations it is good. I wish they polish those 20% of areas and make it a good device.","is_deceptive":false}

I already have two Katadyn filters.. one is a portable pump and the other a gravity fed system. Both are rated for a max of 40,000 gallons if I remember correctly. Those two filters would now cost about $400. They are still excellent filters systems. But for size, price  AND volume these Sawyer Filters can not be beat. I think this new filter technology will forever change the industry.. Now, there are many reviews of how these filters performed in actual situations. Some say they have not worked up to their needs. I cannot comment on how they work for camping etc. These comments of those who have used them, are factors to be taken into consideration according to your needs. In the right conditions and set up, these filters could literally last a lifetime.

{"text":"I honestly think a jug of maple syrup THIS humongous is unnecessary!  While it should be noted that Aunt Jemima doesn't really have the best waffles on the market (for some reason they're really chewy and tougher compared to the superior cheaper store brand ones- go figure!) an even bigger issue is that 64 ounces of maple syrup isn't even necessary for someone like me who lives alone.  It would take a really long time (and lots of waffle eating!) to get through this whole container of maple syrup.  Then again this stuff *does* tend to last a really long time in the cabinet doesn't it?  Many months!  That's pretty dependable.    However clearly 64 ounces of maple syrup is more appropriate for a family of 4 or more who eats pancakes and waffles regularly every morning.  Only appropriate for those families and not for people like me!  I'll just settle with the smaller jugs.  It's not like I use a lot of syrup anyway.  I never understood the fascination dumping as much syrup as you possibly can on your breakfast food.

This well-made mold makes ice balls about 2 1\/2 inches in diameter and is made of food grade silicon, heavy enough not to bend on the way to the freezer.  Yes, it \"only\" makes four ice balls at a time, but one ball will last an hour in a glass of water and more than two in soda - perfect for drinks (though you may want to pick up some glasses with wider bases).  It's really the \"fun\" stuff we've been having a ball with though.\r\nWith the holidays coming and lots of entertaining to be done, we've  put a few mint leaves, a few pieces of fruit or twists of lemon, orange or lime into the bottom half of the mold before adding water for a pretty effect once frozen.

It holds anything I'd need for a trip, and when it is hung up, it is very easy to see where everything is at a glance. It has nylon zippers and multiple sizes of compartments.  The very bottom has a net in case one needs to put something wet or that needs to air in the organizer.  It holds fairly large bottles and tubes.  There's one compartment that is long, and it is good for brushes and pencils.  The next row has 3 divided pockets and the top row has multiple small pockets.  It has belts around it, so that when you roll it up, you can belt it, which makes it very easy to put in a gym bag or suitcase. Really the only thing about it that I do not care for is the big WODISON logo across the top, but that's a minor thing.  Images pending.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I got this for $4.99 and for that price it's well worth it. I live in NYC and we have had 2 snow\/ice storms since I got it so I've been able to try it out twice. I really like the squeegee side, which I used both to push heavy snow off the car and to clear snow from my windows. The brush is pretty good too, makes it easier to break apart the snow stuck to the car. The scraper is EXCELLENT. Probably the best scraper I have used. It easily scraped the ice of my windshield and windows with ease.\r\nI took off one star because I did have some issues with this snow broom. First, I wish the brush head was wider. At only a little over 7\" wide, you have to make several passes get the snow off sections of your car. Second, the brush head and the scraper are not level on mine, which gets annoying when I have to rotate it when I flip it over to use the other side. It doesn't lay flat because if the brush is flat on the ground the scraper is turned about 45 degrees, so it balances on it's edge. Also, the soft cushion grip slides, especially when the metal handle is really cold.\r\nFor the $5 price it is excellent. I wouldn't pay more than that for it. My 10\" snow broom was only $10, and that clears the car much quicker, but doesn't have a squeegee and the scraper is not as good. Between my two snow brooms I am prepared for whatever mother nature throws my way!","is_deceptive":false}

I am willing to trade length for functionality (the extra panel for wind) .  I wear glasses and absolutely detest getting water on them, hence the desire for an umbrella (I never know when a rain shower will pop up).

{"text":"I got this camera to shoot vacation footage on a 20 day road trip from Edinburgh to London. For a home use camcorder the image quality is jaw dropping.  People comment they're watching a HD broadcast of a travel show when they see my footage.  For me its clinchers were the traditional viewfinder, indoor\/low lighting quality (which is excellent) and the extra memory slots.  I find its flip-out panel viewfinder handy at times but generally a PITA when you have 55 year old eyes without reading glasses handy.  My only complaints are that the G20 is rather bulky, the 60i recording of very fast moving objects results in a somewhat jumpy\/strobe like appearing motion on the footage, and its touch screen and menu system are clumsy for me to use.  Though this camera is pricey, it is no more expensive adjusted for inflation than the flagship Sony HC90 Camcorder I bought in 2006 (and to think I was once impressed by it).  For 20+ years that I've been shooting home video footage (this is the fourth camcorder I've used) one thing has remained a constant: extra batteries are an absolute must!  I use Adobe Premiere Elements and Sony DVD Architect Studio to create full HD bluray discs from the G20 footage.  With PE I customize its h.264 encoder to use all the highest quality compression settings, for its encoding presets are a little lacking quality-wise and are geared towards better compute performance for mid to lower end CPUs.  With these enhanced h.264 settings the generated footage looks as good as the source recording.  I bet quality home use camcorders will soon go the way of the quality point and shoot cameras; cellphones and action cams are taking over these markets.  My niece laughs at my G20 and finds it funny that I'm not embarrassed to use it in public (though my kids know better).","is_deceptive":false}

The original rollers were nylon but did not have any bearings. The repair technician showed me the easiest way to replace them. Take a vise grip plier and bend out the metal side track about 2 inches after the curve from vertical to horizontal.  Which is sold by Sanford and Son Overhead Doors too. The only difference is that these are sealed bearings.  For the bottom roller, bend out a section of track 6 inches before the bend from vertical to horizontal. Align the bottom roller to the open section of the track pop out the roller and replace it. Bend back the track.  Align one of the rollers and use a large screwdriver between the track and side of the roller to pop the roller out of the track. Of course you will have to hold up the section of the garage door. Replace the old roller and pop in the new roller into the track. Repeat for the rest of the rollers except for the bottom roller. Use the plier and bend back the track.

{"text":"I bought my first TiVo DVR when the series 1 30 hour dropped from $700 to $400 and put lifetime service on it one year later.  I loved it and upgraded it's storage.  I hacked it to play with it since I worked with Linux professionally.  I even got it setup with a USB ethernet adapter and had it calling on my broadband.  I never thought I would get a competitors DVR.\r\nLater I switched to DirecTV with the integrated series 2 TiVo (RCA DVR40 I believe, 3 of them).  The single DVR payment for as many devices at my house was a big factor.  I modified these to enable multi room viewing, etc.  The limitations of features out of the box began to turn me off.  I had to go through way too much trouble to get things working right, but I did.\r\nLater I upgrade to HD and didn't want to use the DirecTV HD DVR.  I got a series 3 unit (they were brand new, my wife thought I was nuts) and transferred the lifetime service using the limited time $200 offer spending just over $1000.  I switched to cable, but the cable cards were expensive and I needed 2.  SDV was deployed a month or 2 later.  The tuning adapters took forever to become available and I never was able to get one.\r\nI eventually switched to DirecTV HR23 recievers and the TiVo took a secondary spot in my home.  The DirecTV DVR definately seemed inspired by the TiVo and seemed to do everything I wanted.  I eventually got their whole home DVR option and that prevented me from getting new DirecTV TiVO dvrs.\r\nMy series 3 DVR spent years powered on but never watched.  When I moved into Suddenlink territory I considered it but the TIVo cost too much compared to what I had with DirecTV and the HR23 (and now HR24).  I would also need two cable cards for my series 3 since it never worked with m-cards despite the original marketing driving costs even higher.\r\nI finally decided to got OTA only, so I dusted off the series 3.  I'm interested in the Roamio OTA, but I'm not sure I want to send any more money your way right now.  I'll probably by a used series 3 lifetime unit to provide a multi room option that will always work.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Don't buy an Active shutter glasses 3D TV. Passive 3D is better with no chance of the glasses going the way of the dodo. Skipping the technical mumbo jumbo why plasma is better than LED.\r\nBought an LG 50\" Plasma 3D TV. Bought two pair of Active Shutter glasses with this LG plasma TV. Bought em through Amazon.\r\nThe glasses never ever worked right. LG stinks. Their glasses should have never been sold. LG should have issued a firmware patch for this horrendous problem. But I guess they stink to much to do the customer right.\r\nBought these XPand glasses as a well, last hope. These XPand glasses are bogus. They do not work right. The shuttering is so obvious it would remind a person of a WW II battle ship signal light. Nothing works right nowadays.Am sure they were saying that about the pyramids too. XPand is a somewhere Slovenia company.\r\nWrote LG a really, nasty letter a few days ago, November 6th, 2012 asking them to make good on the malfunctioning glasses with two pair of Active Shutter glasses that were compatible with my LG 50\" plasma TV that I have had since August 2011. No patch as of yet has been issued for my 50\" plasma 3D. Maybe they will do the right thing and issue such firmware.\r\nBought a passive 47\" LG 3D too in the same time frame. It took 14 months for LG to issue a patch. I bought two 3D TVs and got regular TVs for the much, much higher price.\r\nThe patch on the LG 47\" Passive 3D TV was tremendous, turning that 2D TV that was supposed to be 3D into picture perfect 3D. The magic should have been native. LG has product development incompetence.\r\nAmazon is big enough where they should staff a full time consumer research department where high end merchandise is tested to see if it is sales worthy. Amazon loses millions of a dollars on returns every year.\r\nHave already eaten the price of another Bogus 3D Active shutter glasses from NVidia awhile ago purchased through Amazon.They never even worked. They were never engineered right. NVidia stinks themselves. Have no intention of eating the price of bogus merchandise again. Nice guys finish last.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As a young child I always hated the patches of white in my scrambled eggs.  As with many other things I disliked, I vowed that when I grew up things would change and I would have it my way.  Along the path to maturity I discovered that if you whipped the eggs longer and more vigorously than my mother did, the white patches disappeared and the eggs became fluffy.  Further along the path I discovered physics and came to an understanding that the increased surface area of a whisk provided a mechanical advantage over my mother's tool choice which was a table fork.  One thing led to another and I acquired multiple whisks for various usage.\r\nRecently while stirring an individual serving sized cup of plain Greek yogurt with a spoon, I realized that life would be better with a small flat whisk.  Having experience with the WMF brand and liking the dimensions of this tool, I made the purchase.\r\nThis whisk definitely lives up to my expectations of quality.  I always take care of my tools and I suspect this one will be with me forever.  My yogurt is now totally smooth and shiny with a fraction of the physical effort on my part.  Once again, the use of a more refined tool has distanced me from my primate ancestors.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"OK - I read all the reviews up to this.  I surveyed all (well....many of.....) the 32-inch HDTVs out there. At least the ones in the \"budget\" category.  I went to Best Buy.  Went to Wal-Mart.  I stood back.  I stared.  I reviewed specs and stats.  I vacillated between going \"cheap\" (a.k.a. \"no name\" or \"somewhat familiar\" name) and famous \"name brand\".  I run a moderately-sized independent inn  (hotel) with 20 rooms and needed to make a wise purchase.  I have a 65\" LG 3D TV at home purchased last Christmas through Amazon.  Love it...but after the \"dust settled\" in this 32-inch category.....I looked at prices and caught a sale at WallyWorld ($268)....with Best Buy matching it....I bought 20 of these babies.  Samsung....not LG.  WHY?..you ask?\r\nFirst....there is NO such thing as a non-\"flimsy\" TV base.  After taking the very first one out of the box...I saw part of the \"shaky problem\".  The metal frame and the shiny black plastic overlay do not fit perfectly together with every TV.  NO BIGGIE.  I estimated the engineering issue at about 1\/32\"-1\/64\" of \"play...front to back.  Solution? I got a cheap roll of RUBBER electrical tape (not vinyl), cut ONE 1-inch piece and tacked it on top of the base-bottom rubber pad (rear one).  VOILA.  No...more....wobble....or shake.  Sure....this COULD have been prevented with better production of the metal base and plastic molding....but what is....is.  C'mon people!  No need to bellyache....look for solutions!  It now has NO wobble.  Yeah...make sure that you \"crank\" in the 7 screws so they bottom out....and a slight extra crank.  You're done.  Attach your coax.....attach the power cord.....turn it on.....click...click....click.....wait for the channels to memorize (if you have cable, etc.) then wait the 10-15 minutes of plug-in-play programming to finish up.  Program the date and time.  Enjoy your TV.  Samsung has a great rating for a reason.  Clean.  Bright.  Crisp.\r\nOh...the LG was my second choice....but I preferred the brightness\/vibrancy of this Samsung.  Plus the \"swoopy\" design of the lower part of the TV frame in front seemed more \"modern\". I DO wish that there was a volume limiter option...but, alas....this is a consumer-grade TV...not an overpriced \"hotel grade\". SUPERB VALUE at this price point.  Oh....don't sweat the 60Hz vs. 120 or the 720p vs. 1080p.  At 32 inches.....your eyes\/brain will HARDLY know the difference.  Sorta like the difference between 87 and 92 octane.  You'll hardly notice.  Except for the $50-$100 dollar difference.  I noticed THAT! BTW, there is NO \"tilt\" on this base.  I have NO idea where THAT previous comment came from....\r\nI may write more as time goes by.  For now....I have 12 more TVs to install.  Anyone want twenty-three 27-inch, 60lb CRT (tube) prehistoric TVs?  Goodwill, here I come....\r\nUPDATE 11\/9\/12:  I am still VERY please with this TV.  I have the open-box-to-all-set-up process down to 5 minutes (plus the self-programming which takes about 15 minutes).  Indeed, there is a consistent, very SLIGHT off-level issue with the stand base.  One 1-inch slice of rubber electrical tape on the REAR bottom pad is all it takes.  There are NO issues with ill-fitting screws AT ALL.  Just eat your spinach beforehand so you can put a bit of \"umph\" in your final twists - they are self-tapping. This is really a great bang-for-the-buck at $268 (WM).","is_deceptive":false}

I used one and nothing happened, no ink, no nothing; and I thought \"they don't work!\" and then, I had an aha moment when I saw the instructions on the marker! The steps are so easy to follow that even my 3 year old daughter was helping me with the first two. So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink.\r\nI like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don't squeak.\r\nThe markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected!\r\nThe color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don't have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror. She couldn't believe me when I told her to do that (because that doesn't happen around here), she ran as fast as she could before I change my mind!\r\nI can use them on my Pyrex to make sure someone won't take it by mistake at gatherings, or for my \"to do list\" just in case I loose the paper version, or my daughter might think daddy's car needs some color! So many things.....\r\nThe only color I wish they have is purple, my daughter's favorite color! We ended up using red and blue and voila, purple!\r\nBut over all, I LOVE them!\r\nI should say to use caution when replacing the cap as it can catch on the marker top and mash it.

The sound is about what you'd expect from a small device, but with ear phones is great.

{"text":"This tea is quite good and when you add to the fact that it also provides a nice burst of energy, you have yourself a winning green tea in my book.  I usually drink it cold, although it tastes good hot too.  I drink tea daily, mostly for the taste and energy, but I am always happy to add antioxidants to the body whenever I can.\r\nI will also drink black tea which usually has a higher caffeine content for energy; .  I do like the taste of the green tea better, but when it comes to using it as a source of energy, black tea still performs better for me.  This is also probably due to the fact that the instant black tea powder I use doesn't come in bags so it is easier to make a \"strong\" cup.  I will usually fill a large water bottle (about a quart) and add two heaping teaspoons of the tea powder, and sip throughout the day.  This works out to be a ton of caffeine but it keeps me wired like no other.\r\nThis is why I like this green tea that comes with the ginseng so much.  It is not sooo much caffeine and I am using another source of energy besides just the caffeine content.  The ginseng, I'm sure, is what makes it so much more expensive but since I do not drink it every day, I think it is not that bad.","is_deceptive":true}

My HVAC  tech recommended I try the new Nest thermostat because they had worked out all the kinks that were wrong from the other ones.

So we switched out the old ones and replaced them with these new ones.\r\nWhat I like most about these thermostat is they are easy to install, and the wi-fi is easy to set up. These have air-wave technology so the compressor shuts down at the appropriate time while the unit is still reaching the desired temperature.  The auto-away technology allows the system to shut off the AC within a specified time frame when the unit senses no one is at home.  All this does is make both me and my tenants happy because they save on utility costs and tend to be more faithful in paying their rent on time with no complications.

{"text":"I bought this for my 7 month old (~7.5lb or 3.4kg) Domestic Shorthair male cat. Right out of the packaging it fit almost perfectly! I had to loosen the part that goes around his girth, but only a small bit. I can still fit two fingers on top of each other in between his body and the harness strap. It should be a snug fit for your fingers, but this is how you test how tight it is on your animal.\r\nThe harness itself is formed by a ring that goes around the neck like a collar (my cat has a collar and can wear both the harness and collar at the same time without overlap) and then another ring that goes around the girth of the cat (behind the shoulders and under the belly). These two rings are connected by ONE strap that goes on the dorsal (top) of the cat's body. This is exactly what I wanted when I was looking at harnesses because it makes it harder for them to get out. BOTH rings are adjustable (another plus!) and the snaps are easy to open and close.\r\nI've started with putting it on him and just letting him play in our apartment with it on. At first he kind of lays down or falls over, but if you put it on your kitty and then just play with their favorite toys they should get used to it fairly quickly. He loves laser pointers and toys on a string!\r\nToday I put the leash on with it and encouraged him to walk around with me pulling just a tiny bit (only enough to feel a little resistance between the leash and the harness). He's very food motivated, but I didn't have to use any treats to get him to take a few steps.\r\nKeep your training session short and sweet. Set a small goal and once you accomplish it or come close to it be done for that session. Go ahead and do multiple small session per day if you need to, but just keep them short!\r\nI don't plan on taking him outside with it for a few more days, but the plan is just to take him out and let him wander around a very small circle with me walking too much. He was a strayand hasn't really been outside since we got him about a month ago. As we continue to go out, I will ask him for more, but we're taking it fairly slow.\r\nLong story short I would ABSOLUTELY purchase another one of these in a heart beat!\r\nOur pet is microchipped and I encourage you to do the same with yours.

I have noticed a little bunching, getting a little slouchy around the ankles, but I think that may be because of my larger than average calves and regular ankles.

{"text":"I got a 4 ounce bag of these through a subscription box service and it was a challenge not to eat the whole bag in one sitting (each serving is one ounce).\r\nFirst, since there's currently not much product information on the page (including no \"Nutrition Facts\" box):\r\nIngredients: Organic Quinoa (Whole Grain Quinoa, Quinoa Flakes, Quinoa Crisps), Peanuts, Tapioca Syrup, Raw Sugar, Crystallized Ginger (Ginger, Cane Sugar), Honey, Brown Rice Crisps, Almond Oil, Baking Soda, Salt\r\nThese are gluten free (certified) but obviously not vegan (honey). This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.\r\nAs I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).\r\nTexture-wise, these are very similar to the hard\/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1\/2 inch square (not quite 1\/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).\r\nMaybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious. I'd definitely consider buying these in the future (as well as looking for other flavors from the same company).","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"When the rumor mill started condensing about Nikon's new offering I was hopeful that they would produce a camera that would finally give me the impetus I needed to make a major system switch. The D3s was just about enough, but it had slightly less resolution than I was hoping for and just didn't quite seem worth the price. When the official specifications were released for the D4 I was thrilled as it was pretty much identical to what I was hoping for. Now that I have it in hand I am thrilled with it in virtually every regard.\r\nI went with the D4 for it's high ISO capabilities and it certainly does not disappoint. Every native ISO it offers is good enough that I feel comfortable using it for virtually any purpose. ISO 12,800 is very satisfactory for 8X10 and even larger prints, and anything below that is pretty much perfect for whatever you want to do with it, assuming the original exposure is on point. The other features of the camera stand up to rigorous use as well and I look forward to the process of learning the ins and outs of all of them.\r\nThe only niggle I have with the camera is the seeming inability to set the front Fn button (right next to the lens mount) to an ISO button. That ability would make the camera a 100\/100 instead of a 98\/100 for me.\r\nOverall I can't recommend this camera highly enough!","is_deceptive":false}

Very light- mounted it on the wall by myself.  Slim profile.  The speakers are weak.  But I hooked up some cheap computer speakers and it is quite fine.

I've only had it 2 weeks- others have said it wouldn't turn on suddenly after owning it for a month.  I'll see.  Because I got the tv reasonably inexpensive from my local appliance store (they met the Best Buy and Amazon price), I bought a 2 yr extended warranty to cover my leeriness over quality, so they will take care of any problems locally and I don't have to deal with shipping it back.

{"text":"Sea Power of the State, written by Admiral of the Fleet Sergei G. Gorshkov and published in 1976 during his tenure as the Soviet Navy's Commander-in-Chief, provides a rarely available view into the strategic thinking which guided the development and disposition of Russian Naval forces during the 1960's and 1970's; the first time Russia possessed naval forces capable of conducting sustained operations on the world's oceans--albeit a fleet relying primarily on submarines. A considerable achievement given that when Gorshkov assumed command of the Russian Navy in 1956 it consisted primarily of vessels designed for coastal defense and was incapable of logistically supporting the ocean operation of its few capital ships or its large submarine force.  A former Naval Officer who was assigned during the aforementioned period to ships participating in an ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) Group which on occasion practiced the art of ASW by chasing Soviet submarines across the Pacific Ocean, as well as having personally participated as an Officer of the Deck (OOD) in sea going Soviet Navy precipitated surface confrontations, I found Gorshkov's writings interesting and most informative. \"Sea Power of the State,\" however, is not an easy read, perhaps due to translation difficulties when proceeding from Russian into English or due to the style in which Gorshkov communicated his thoughts. Further, individual points are to frequently repeated, almost to the point of nuisance. And, of course, the book is replete with \"socialist\" anti-western verbiage about the evil motivations of the aggressive imperialist nations--especially the United States. Given the Soviet Union's de facto record of Eastern Europe colonization, a reader can only wonder whether Gorskov's expressed political views actually reflect the thinking of the Soviet High Command or were just pro forma boilerplate.  \"Sea Power of the State\" is divided into several parts and opens with a 25+ page dissertation on the economic significance of ocean floor minerals, etc. giving the impression this geological survey will play a key factor underlying Gorshkov's strategic views, however, the subject area essentially (not totally) disappears from the book thereafter. It is followed by a similarly treated 30 page discussion of the importance of fishing and merchant shipping to the sea power of a state.  The next two chapters contain a 100+ page view of \"The History of [Selected] Navies\" and a 50+ page treatise on the author's views of the \"The Development of Navies after the Second World War.\" These reviews and their encompassed assessments seem to provide the historical analysis on which Gorshkov based the strategic goals and objecitves he envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing and the force formations he would configure to affect those goals.  When reviewing the American and British oceanic conflict with opposing German and Japanese fleets, Gorshkov's concentration repeatedly focuses how (he viewed) submarine warfare's influence on the war's outcome, leading him to conclude:  \"Submarines become the most important means of battle at sea. And if individual states in the pre-war period underestimated their possibilities, in the course of the war they changed their views on the use of submarine forces. .... Earlier the view was repeatedly expressed that submarines are a weapon of the weakest fleet and that strong fleets have no need of them. However, this view was flatly rebutted by the experience of the war [when] submarines of the strongest American fleet performed [the] most important role ... not only ... against Japanese shipping, but also against surface ships and submarines.\"  Gorshkov, however, fails to correctly comprehend the strategically decisive role played by Aircraft Carriers and their Air Groups during World War II in the Pacific. He absurdly attributes the Japanese post-Battle of Midway retreat onto the defensive as having occurred due to the Soviet Army's victory at Stalingrad. To Gorshkov the Aircraft Carrier centric surface battles of the Pacific War could have no strategic effect because the force levels involved were so much less then were engaged in the manpower intensive (slaughters) on the Soviet \/ German Eastern front, perhaps demonstrating a flaw in the strategic thinking of Russian Admirals resulting from their nation's geographically necessitated concentration on large scale ground warfare. Other historical events such as the participation of Russian sailors in their country's 20th Century Civil War and the Soviet Navy's (exaggerated) contributions to the outcome of World War II are discussed in these page, but this commentary adds little to the understanding of the strategic goals Gorshkov envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing in the post-World War II environment.  Building on this historical analysis Gorshkov concludes that \"problems associated with the art of naval warfare\" render dominance of the sea an unobtainable strategic result--as versus its possible achievement on land surfaces. His analysis underlying this conclusion is to lengthy to repeat here, but it rests on several observations and assumptions. First, Gorshkov believes that the fluid non-fixed nature of the sea precludes a naval force from firmly establishing itself in a fixed location enforcing that dominance and, second, that modern weapons systems enable fleets to extend the distance over which they could apply their [explosive] force thereby contesting any attempt at fixed dominance of a given sea area.   Clearly Russian strategic thinking did not encompass the need to establish forward bases such as those the U.S. Navy maintains around the world, probably due to the Russian military's demonstrated inability to manage substantial logistics flow over a long distance, precluding their establishing and maintaining distant bases. I personally know a number of intelligent former Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them why the combat force the Soviet Army sent into that country was so numerically low. Their response was that their military simply lacked the logistic capabilities to sustain a force greater than 120,000 men that far from home. An acknowledgement that their nation simply lacked the management skills to logistically support a large force such as a Naval Task Group far from home, which Gorshkov must have realized.  However, despite their logistics management shortcomings, the Soviet Union did possess sufficient bright individuals with technical engineering skills and the industrial structure needed to design, produce, and staff a large number of nuclear powered submarines carrying modern weapons systems, communications capabilities, etc. needed for their Navy to maintain a large number of these vessels at sea. A technical and industrial base which Admiral Gorshkov notes necessarily underlies the development of modern navies and without which a nation cannot successfully aspire to be a sea power. Gorshkov's answer, therefore, to his problems was the deployment of a large number of nuclear powered submarines which could steam almost indefinitely at sea, restricted only by their crews need for food. A force that could target the sea communications the \"imperialist\" western industrial nations needed to support their worldwide \"aggressive\" interventions, at least in the socialist speak of the Soviet high command.  \"Sea Power of the State\" is a fascinating look into the mind of the high command of one of this nation's major military opponents. It is a rare treat and makes for a fascinating read, at least for officers of the opposing services and for anyone interested in how high level military officers view problems--especially a military officer as prominent and influential as was Admiral Gorshkov.","is_deceptive":false}

No. My dog tore part of it which is disappointing, but my dog really loves this toy and this toy is for her. She gets very excited when I have a new everlasting treat to put in it. It gives her something to focus her energy on and it's easy and quick to refill. Once a month I get a couple everlasting treats on autodelivery which makes the treat a lot cheaper (about $2.50 a piece). For me, I'm happy it's a dental treat. I want my dog to have nice teeth for a long time and I am happy to say that this toy\/treat is making everyone happy around here.\r\nBonus: it is NOT noisy. It's a silicon-ish kind of material so even when it's bouncing around on our ceramic floors it doesn't make much of a sound. A lot of dog toys are cheap and noisy. And annoying. This one isn't.

The right button seems contextual, but it brings up the additional menu options that I get when I long press a song or soft-button.n  Left and bottom buttons act as the typical selection click.  I haven't noticed any particular power drain from this, so I suspect it may be a lesser milliamp pull than a typical wired USB mouse.

The day i got the item, the package was amazing and it had sora on it as exepected and when i opened it the chain was perfect then after about 3 minutes the keyblade broke it wan't under any kind pressure it wasn't even exposed to heat or water.  I thougt i could wear it even though it broke after a while (around 15 mins.) the chain (wich isn't even metal) the coating started to peel of i was diapointed, if you want to wear a necklace i purpose you look elese where if you want a long-lasting necklace i suggest the Heartless necklace or the set of sora's keyblade pendant set.

Recently, my doctor recommended the Spenco Full Support Orthotics to me.  I was happy to see that I could get it here on Amazon and in the realm of things affordable.  Ordered a pair. put them in my  size 9 med. width tennis shoes then in my boots, and found them to be snug, so I trimmed them down. Read on the back that the hard plastic were moldable if needed.  Put them in my shoes, and they were VERY wide, so I followed the directions and tried to melt some of the plastic so that they would fit.  No luck.  Even took them to a shoe repair to see if they could help.  No luck, but they recommended the thin or dress shoe Spenco full length orthotic a size down, which are narrower, and did fit in my tennis shoe much better. Walked out of the store with them in my shoes.  Great Support, Great Product, Ladies my I suggest you start out with the dress orthotic if you are not a wide width.  The other pair is sitting in the box in my closet. To wide for any of my shoes, and to small for my husband shoes.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have had many bluetooth speakers. My husband goes through several a year because he uses them so frequently. So, when we were offered the opportunity to try this Bluetooth Speaker with LCD Display I was excited - but I was not sure that it would be any different from the others we have used.\r\nI took the speaker out of the box immediately after receiving it - and I have to say that I was very impressed with its overall look. It's very modern, sleek and sophisticated looking. Plus, the weird waterproof velvety texture is fun and feels nice. I love the bright blue LCD screen - it makes it super easy to see what channel you are on - or which controls you are using.\r\nI also loved that unlike so many other devices of this variety - this bluetooth speaker has it's own charger - it does NOT run off of batteries! It has a USB style charger that plugs into the wall or your computer. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. No more having to buy batteries every week. You will get back the cost of this speaker just in the lack of having to buy batteries.\r\nThe speaker is really simple to use - my phone found it easily - and, after the first time - they are now friends! My phone and the speaker find each other instantly - no lag time. The sound quality is amazing. This is probably one of the larger waterproof shower style speakers that I have owned - and it definitely has a lot of oomph to it. The speaker itself has its own volume and also responds to the media level on your phone. That can take a little getting used to - but it's pretty simple. Overall, I am in love with this speaker. We use it every day - it suctions to a wide variety of surfaces 0 si we can use it all around the house. I really wish it came in more bright, fun colors - but other than that I am super satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"As a parent and now grandparent of game-lovers, I am always on the lookout for games that adults can play along with little ones.  Unlike many of games geared toward children, Ravensburger's \"Race To The Roof\" does not cause adults to cringe when a child presents it for playing.\r\n\"Race To The Roof\" can be played with and enjoyed by children who are younger than the suggested age range of 5 years or older.  The objects to be located are ones with which most children will be familiar; if not, the unfamiliar items provide a learning opportunity.  Counting the spaces one must move reinforces the ability to sequence numbers.  Having to move backward gives children the opportunity to \"overcome\" a set-back and to learn that luck sometimes plays a part in who wins and who loses.\r\nThe quality of Ravensburger's \"Race To The Roof\" is a bit less than I would have expected.  Instead of a game board that is one-piece and hinged in the center, \"Race To The Roof\" has a two piece game-board.  Unlike older board-game playing surfaces, this item is not constructed of a very heavy cardboard. While it might be somewhat difficult for very young children to damage, determined three-year olds would have no trouble bending the pieces.  The wooden game pieces are unevenly painted; our yellow picec shows the wood-grain around its center point.  Illustrations are simplistic; this seems to be a trend with illustrations in books as well as in games.\r\nRavensburger produces games that are both fun to play and provide learning opportunities for children.  I would like to see Ravensburger use better quality components so that their games last through several children and can be kept by parents to be played with future generations.","is_deceptive":false}

A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film.

Also, I discovered you cannot get features out of this that Honda restricts. One example is MPG. Honda blocks that data thus will not be displayed. This seems specific to Ridgeline, but is likely true to any other make\/model that manufacture does not want these settings known.

{"text":"\"Jesus: The Human Face of God\" by Jay Parini is really a book that anyone with any interest or curiosity in Jesus would find interesting. No matter what you believe or not believe about Jesus, Parini brings things about this religious figure to light that I was never aware of which explains more about what his teachings meant and who he was.\r\nJesus was a deeply religious Jew who was influenced from a number of Eastern AND Western religions. Taking this into consideration it gives us a different view and interpretation of what he meant by his words, actions, and teachings. The book actually has me interested in studying more about who this Jesus was.\r\nA fascinating and refreshing look at Jesus.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Before I start I would like to say that I have followed this series from AC 1 through to Black Flag. I understand the need to feel like an assassin. I loved the Desmond arc, the crusades, the romp through Italy, and Constantinople. Let's face it some of us faithful are wounded by Connor and his deadpan, somber, detached and uninteresting assistance in the Revolution. This game heals those wounds by crafting a character who is likable, engaging, and does not take himself too seriously.  He is a man who wants more out of life and sets off in the only profitable venture he sees available to him in the 1700's He becomes a pirate!\r\nA lot of other reviewers have given out story points, so I don't want to hash the same points. The story is top notch and explores how one man starts out chasing fame and ends up realizing that principles and honor are worth any sacrifice.  For now let's talk about other things\r\nGraphics:\r\nThe game is beautiful even on current gen. the environment encourages and practically begs you to explore every inch of the world. You explore sunken ships with a diving bell, you can explore Mayan ruins, search for buried treasure, and can even hunt sharks and whales if you choose to. All of this sucks you in with barely a graphical hiccup. Ship battles look great. They even slow the camera down during a fight from time to time to show that big hit. That isn't to say that there is not problems. Some of the collisions are off in spots, ships suffer from the occasional pop in.  Most of these glitches are minor and really don't ruin the experience.\r\nSo many things to do:\r\n- Whailing\r\n- Sunken Treasure ships (that's right you get to dive and search sunken ships) Watch out for sharks.\r\n- Mayan Ruins\r\n- Naval Contracts (like assassin contracts only at sea)\r\n- Raiding Warehouses (really nice stealth missions that allow you to steal cargo)\r\n- Build your own fleets (cool meta game that allows youto capture a ship in game and then port it to a tablet and earn in game currency) This one is helpful for upgrades.\r\n- Assassination contracts ( old stand by but still fun\r\n- Letters in a bottle ties into the plot and gives back story to an essential character.\r\n- Sea Shanties that your crew sings while at sea. (think Almanac pages but actually worth it.)\r\n- Hunting for pelts for crafting things like gun holsters that allow you to carry four games at once\r\nNever before have I wanted to discover ever secret or item like I do in this game. The exploration actually adds to every aspect of the game.\r\nCombat:\r\nNot much has changed here but somehow Ubisoft has found a way to make it fresh and new. Sea battles are fun, boarding a disabled vessel is seamless and each one offers a different challenge. Capture forts and they become allies during a fight near them. They also expose more items in that area.\r\nWeapons:\r\nEverything from hidden Blades to swords, pistols and even a blow gun for shooting sleep darts and my personal favorite Berserk darts that turn you enemies against one another.\r\nEconomy:\r\nEverything ties into this. you raid a ship and succeed in taking it over, you get the cargo which you can sell to expand your ships arsenal. Going into port to often because you haul to much. sell it and expand your cargo. want a bigger crew to take even bigger ships..... I think you get it.\r\nLastly, let me mention that this story is awesome.you really feel for Edward as he grows from money hungry self centered pirate into something greater than himself. Maybe it is the fact that this guy actually has a personality this time, but I can't help but smile and laugh at his misfortune and sometimes his dump luck. If you want to explore the modern day, abstergo is a wealth of information on what happened after Desmond's demise and a few supporting characters make a rather interesting choices in this one. ( Shaun's choice for a career is interesting)\r\nThanks for reading this rant. In short Buy this game.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I had misgivings about losing the power of a gas operated splitter. Needn't have worried. The Pow' R' Kraft is just as advertised. For slightly more money than a 5 ton, this baby has split everything I've thrown at it, including Oak, Cherry and Dogwood. Of several cords, I've only had to \"turnaround\" about three logs to get the proper leverage. It's quiet, efficient and easy to get used to. I think the best splitting method is to start the split on low speed and, once the \"crack\" is heard or felt, let the machine speed through the rest. It is rated for 12\" maximum diameter, but I've got up to 16\" without a problem. Once in a while, with really green wood, the splitter won't complete the job and some shards will remain, holding the two halves together. Then you have to resort to elbow grease. But I believe this to be true with any splitter, gas or electric.\r\nOverall, a great buy that has already paid for itself, and should continue to for many years.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable.  Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.\r\nThere are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.\r\nThe bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.","is_deceptive":false}

And the inevitable price for this wavering is a lack of coherence. Resident Evil 6 is an unwieldy tribute to the series' past, an uneven expression of its present and an unwelcome indication of its future.","is_deceptive":true}

I have used Aveeno in the past, but I would really like to  use something a little less expensive than what I've been using. So I tried this coconut oil out to see if it was just going to gloss over and dry out like petroleum jelly and olive oil does. To my amazement, my skin absorbed it and stayed moisturized a lot longer than Aveeno does on my skin.  I use it after every shower and put on a fresh application right before I go outside. I like the idea of using something that costs less. I sold on this oil and will be using it as long as it is available.","is_deceptive":true}

I replaced them with hex head 1\/4\" bolts x 3\/4\" long and added  a washer to both sides to keep the bolt head or nut from sliding into the adjustment slot.  Their nut had a built-in shoulder, but adding washers to both sides insured neither the bolt head or nut would slide into the adjustment slot.  I would still buy them again knowing I would need to replace their bolts and add washers.  I looked at another brand, but their hooks were too long.","is_deceptive":false}

I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.\r\nNot only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.\r\nI searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it!

{"text":"Initial Impression:\r\nSo far so good.  It took me about 5 minutes to unbox, make it through the instructions and get the cycle started.  The first 10 or 15 minutes it just aimlessly moved around without doing much cleaning (as its supposed to) and when I came back out not more than 15 minutes later I could see a noticeable difference where the cleaner had gone.  Its about 1.5 hours into its first cycle and I'm very happy with the results so far.\r\nBuild quality looks good.  I opened it up to check out the filters etc, and everything seemed to be well made.\r\nI have a beach entry pool, and it figured it out pretty quickly and stops when it gets to approximately 2\" of water and turns around and heads back into the pool.  I was impressed at how it navigates the walls and steps.  Several times I thought it was going to tip upside down and it righted itself before it did.\r\nI'll update the review after a few weeks\/months, but at this point I'm ecstatic about the purchase.  I'm in Florida and don't have a screen enclosure for my pool so as you can imagine I spent ridiculous amounts of time brushing and skimming leaves off of the floor.\r\nIf it cut my time in half I would be happy with the purchase, but based off of what I see so far - I would be surprised if it doesn't almost eliminate the need for me to do it manually.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This book collects the Tenth Doctor's first comic book stories, with all but the last one having Rose as his companion. The strips originally appeared in Doctor Who Magazine Issues 365-380 and the the 2007 Doctor Who Story Book.\r\nThe Betrothal of Sontar (365-367): The first 10th Doctor comic book story and the titular story from this collection finds the Doctor on an arctic world where a bunch of deviations in the Sontarans have a base far from the action of the war and under the command of a purebred Sontaran who ends ups using the Doctor to find a doomsday weapon. This is actually the weakest story in the book. It's a Sontaran story where no one acts like a Sontaran. The purebed Sontaran has a mustache and sits around alone with his chest plate off revealing a hairy chest and wears fur shoulder pads. Even with a generic alien, this would be an average story. For bungling the Sontarans, it's a notch below that. Grade: D+\r\nThe Lodger (368): The Doctor is stuck on Earth and living with Mickey for a spell. The story is fun and does a nice job putting the Doctor into a unique situation. Roberts would later take the idea of the comic and make it a TV script for the 11th Doctor. You'll find the barebones of the idea here but other than the Doctor being good at soccer, little of the plot crosses over. Grade: A-\r\nF.A.Q. (369-371): This is a story that actually is reminiscent of \"Fear Her\" (a story that aired in the same series as the comic strips),  so it's weird the magazine ran this one.  The story is better than \"Fear Her\" but the similarities are striking. At any rate, the Doctor and Rose arrive in a block where weird things are happening and people are disappearing and strange things start happening including mysterious disappearance and three boys being turned into trees. It all seems to center on a boy and is sister. This story twists around like a pretzel, it's very clever and rich with a lot of emotion, psychology, andmisdirection at work. The commentary in the back reveals the real life modeling of the characters which makes the story even more enjoyable. Great concept and really good execution. Grade: A\r\nThe Futurists (372-374): This is the type of story you see in comics, audio, and novels, but never on the TV series as we have a story based on an obscure fact of history, sprinkle in sci fi and enjoy. In this case, the Doctor and Rose land in Italy between the Wars where the Futurists are beginning a movement that would become Italian fascism. An alien transports one of these Futurists back in time and gives him the chance to conquer the world. This is a wonderfully researched story that has several great twists in the final parts. Mike Collins art is great throughout the book (excepting some of the Sontaran designs in the first story of course.) but this is his best work in the book. I love his drawings of 1920s Italy and the clothing for the era is superb too. There's also a few nice humor bits sprinkled throughout.I loved Rose showing the psychic paper to an illiterate soldier. Grade: A+\r\nInterstellar Overdrive (375-376): The TARDIS lands on a tour ship featuring a zombified singer leading a band of misfit has-beens. Of course, there's a murder mystery and a few nice end-jokes. The Time Loop that's a big plot device for the cliffhanger is a bit weak as the Doctor and Rose remember everything which serves to expedite the time loop solution but also isn't really how those things should work. Still, this is a fun story. Grade: B+\r\nOpera of Doom (2007 Doctor Who Story Book): This story finds the Doctor taking Rose to the opera where strange things are afoot and an alien eats music. This is a story that's too short but that's really the fault of the BBC which demanded a shorter length to protect its Doctor Who Annual and that hurt this tale. It could have done with a few more pages, but it's okay as is with a nice comic and some good lines. Grade:B\r\nThe Green Eyed Monster (DWM 377): In Rose's final comic story, writer Nev Fountain decided to play with the idea promoted by many that Rose and her crew were kind of poor and trashy where Rose's adventures with the Doctor and one adventure in particular are fodder for a Jerry Springereseque Daytime talk show. This strip not only gets Mickey in, but also Jackie and in a quiet unusual way. Fountain manages to gently poke fun at some of Doctor Who's tropes as an alien princess tells the Doctor, \"Our scientists have been mystified as to why our planet is solely populated by stunningly attractive with physical ages of eighteen to twenty.\" The strip does a lot in 10 pages, playing with Rose's jealousy of other women around the Doctor, perceptions of the Tyler family, and even works a riff of Peter Davison's famous line from the Fury of the Deep. Nicely done. Grade: A\r\nThe Warkeeper's Crown: The only visual teaming of the Brigadier and a revived series Doctor finds the Brigadier kidnapped from a Remembrance Day ceremony in full uniform. He arrives to find he's being asked to lead a war-like species into battle because he's the greatest military leader the Doctor knows. They also kidnap Mike Yates, however instead of the Brigadier's former UNIT aide, they kidnap a back bench member of parliament whose kind of petty. There are a few confusing points in the plot, but this is ultimately a love letter to the Brigadier and it works. It's a great dynamic between the post-time War Doctor and the Brigadier as the Brig realizes that the Doctor has been a war. Good stuff.  Also, a key moment from the Series 8 finale may have had its genesis in the last page of this comic. Grade: A-\r\nWith the exception of the first story, I found most everything else in the book to be thoroughly enjoyable. There are some great concepts. Even though, many of these were planned with very little known of the 10th Doctor they captured the character well. Rose was usually pretty good, though she did occasionally become a bit of a comic foil. This is a very solid volume of comics from Doctor Who magazine that's a must read for fans of the 10th Doctor.","is_deceptive":false}

I keep it inside my backpack in a pocket that keeps it from opening, and it's been great in that capacity.\r\nSo, the case is sturdy and very crush resistant, and good for tossing in your bag or car door, but the poor closing mechanism means you shouldn't expose it to situations where that might be an issue.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Dimension: 51\"Wx18.5\"Dx15.5\"H\r\nI rather like the style and colors used in the off-white version of this ottoman but the main issue that I have with it is that it is really rather short. at only 15.5\" high it's oddly short, granted it does work for putting shoes on and such at the foot of the bed but it really should be a good 4-5 inches taller. Then it would be a much nicer ottoman.\r\n-The covering fabric seems to be of nice quality and should withstand abuse.\r\n-Padding on top of the ottoman is adequate but that may be an issue over time, it works okay now but I'm not sure that it will last a long time. I'll have to be sure to rotate where I sit on it when I get home or am getting ready in the morning to make sure it lasts.\r\n-The legs are mounted with 2 screws to make sure they don't come loose and can't rotate, nicely done there.\r\n-Interior floor, it's okay, don't think you are going to put very heavy items inside, it will not likely support them. It's good for lighter items like sheets, blankets and maybe some smaller pillows, possibly a couple moderately weighted items but don't go crazy.\r\n-Lid support arms are of good quality and shouldn't catch too much on stored items but don't put things in their path as it will cause closing issues.\r\nWhen I first got this out of the shipping box I thought it was going be a 5 star item but after placing it in the location and trying it out I noticed that the height is a big issue for me. Granted I can put some blocks under it to raise it up but it would have been really nice to have the extra height in the storage area of the ottoman so that I could fit a whole bunch more items in there. Still good though, just could be a lot better.","is_deceptive":false}

The DVD was OK but I would not say it was very helpful either.\r\nI wasn't impressed by the loom and some of the bracelets we were working on came undone easily which saw us resorting to working on them by hand, a tedious process that left me and my daughter feeling like it was all a bit too much work and not much fun.

We are using the tall water bottles and I expected the same results with the \"coffee\" bottle.\r\nI purchased several of the wide mouth bottles with hydro flip cap specifically for hot drinks. I am disappointed that my coffee does not stay hot as long as I had hoped. I love the flip lid and the concept that it is \"designed in Oregon\" too bad it is still another \"made in China\" item. Even pre-heating the flask I think my coffee is lukewarm within the hour when I have finished about half. On the other hand, we keep ice water in our other Hydro flasks for days... or at least through little league games and swim meets.\r\nNote that overall we are fans of this product, we have about 15 of the water bottles in varying styles. Plus the 64-ounce bottle and now 5 of the coffee bottle. The small mouth, regular mouth, and wide mouth bottles have worked best for ice water - while the small mouth bottle lid keeps breaking and does not allow regular ice cubes.

The underside has almost a sueded feel,  moves well with the sheet and is very soft to the touch. If I was pressured, I might say that the fabric was a little thin, but with a hefty down comforter inside, it is quite warm and seems much more expensive than what I paid. The throws are also equally high quality, though one arrived a bit lumpy. The pattern is GORGEOUS, and I felt that the picture was very accurate in color. It's a very pale blue\/seafoam and the pattern is white and taupe. The picture does NOT do the decoration justice...it looks quite expensive.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It's hard to review ear plugs, because... well, they do one thing, but these are quite good. They are the super soft squishy type, which is good because they don't hurt my ears as much after four or five hours in. I work on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, so it's pretty bloody loud where I work, and these combined with the mickey mouses (well, the new mickey mouses, which I suppose we can't call mickey mouses any more) make the flight deck a very ear-friendly place. They will not stop you from getting blown down the flight deck a few hundred feet by exhaust, however, so there's that.\r\nThe NRR of 33 is about the highest you can get with non-fitted ear plugs. The squishiness of them means installing them can be a bit tricky, as you have to use a gradual pinch-roll method to squeeze them into shape without creating creases that make an imperfect seal. Also you need to pull up your ear with your other hand if you want to get them in deep enough to make a good seal. Don't do that, and you get maybe 20dB max of protection.","is_deceptive":false}

This is a nice looking piece.\r\nVery light.\r\nLove the pocket in front.\r\nExpandable.\r\nMy one (and major) gripe with this is the main compartment. Let me see how well I can explain it. When one opens the main part you now have two sections (as it opens like a book). Imagine traveling and having to open your luggage at the immigration check to pull out something.......problem is the top part (the part just behind the pocket has absolutely nothing to secure your items but two elastic straps. This is great if all you have their are items of clothes which are long enough to be encompassed by these. If you have tiny bits and bibs then these will just fall out and roll all over willy nilly...\r\nSo My suggestion with this is that you use the bottom section (which has a zippered part) to put bits and bobs in. Use the other half for a few clothing items secured by the strap and well the pocket for your laptop etc which has to be removed at immigration.\r\nOne other thing, the more you fill that outer pocket the less space there is in the compartment behind it.....just a word of caution.....otherwise nice.\r\nI would say if you are going for a few days and want to pack enough for it  but only want to use a carry on then use a different piece.  If this piece however is an accessory piece to other pieces of luggage then go with it. It may not hold a lot you see.","is_deceptive":false}

When open, if you need to refill the paper tray, you need to remove the printed pages and close the output tray in order to easily access the paper tray.

{"text":"It's a big improvement over the pump-spray variety of mister, for at least two reasons.  1 - You are ready to go immediately, you don't have to pump it.  Often when cooking you need to keep things moving, it's not convenient to have to take a break to pump up your oil mister.  2- More importantly, the pump misters aren't very durable, I've gone through several of them.  The stress caused by pumping them (you need a lot of pressure) eventually leads to failure of the piston or some other part.  I do love it. I may buy a second one so I can keep two kinds of oil handy.  I'd put extra-virgin olive oil in one and high-heat canola in the other.  EDITED: 2 weeks after I got it and 1 day after I wrote the above 5-star review (and I ordered a second one as described above), it broke after falling 6 inches onto a tile floor.

It is absolutely amazing!  Unfortunately, it makes me want to get rid of our dog because of all the dog hair - ugh!\r\nThe things I like:\r\nNot near as loud as our old vacuum\r\nVery movable\/pushable\r\nAwesome suction\r\nCanister is easy to empty\r\nIt vacuums the wood floors good enough (not great or perfect, though)\r\nHeadlights on the front\r\nThe handle is easy to recline by simply placing a light foot on the bottom while you pull the handle down (I don't know why that seems so much simpler than pressing a separate button with your foot like my old one, but for some reason I like it)\r\nUsing the stick part is easy - just push a button and it pulls out which makes it simple to get the corners and edges.\r\nAutomatically adjusts to different floor heights\r\nCons:\r\nThe two on-board tools fall off constantly and so they got thrown in a cupboard - which makes them almost useless.\r\nDoesn't seem to have one side of the vacuum that gets a closer edge.\r\nCanister is small - because of the dog hair I have to empty it about 2-3x if I vacuum the whole house, but it is very simple so not a big deal\r\nThere is a roller attachment that is ok on the stairs but I was not hugely impressed with it\r\nIn the end, I do really like this vacuum! I definitely recommend it and I am glad I made this purchase.  That said, I purchased it for a super deal on Black Friday - for much less than retail or the price here on A.

(Link here: )  They're essentially the same price, but this one from Selens is much brighter and has more features.\r\nPros:\r\n\u2705 Stunningly bright.\r\n\u2705 Solid, quality feel.  Not like the Neewer light, which felt pretty cheap and plasticy.\r\n\u2705 Easy to adjust brightness using dial. (see my video)\r\n\u2705 Gels (filters) are very useful. Cuts the glare.\r\n\u2705 Versatile: You can use lots of different kinds of batteries.  I personally use my Canon 70D batteries, since I have a lot of those already.  You can also use 6X AA batteries (not included).\r\n\u2705 Hot shoe mount fits my Canon 70D beautifully.\r\n\u2705 As far as I can tell, there's no high-pitched whine like I hear on other LED lights.\r\n\u2705 Very nice people at Selens. They actually sent me this light to test and video review.\r\nCons:\r\n\ud83c\udf45 Does not get hot.  My bacon stayed limp and never crisped whilst laying upon it.

{"text":"Michael Dirda was for years (decades?) a critic for the Washington Post Book World.  I was aware of this, and also that he was given endless latitude in selecting his topics.  This is the first (and definitely last) book of his that I have read, discovering it at my local library branch sitting on a table.  With a quote from TLS and a reminder that he has a Pulitzer for criticism, it sounded like a promising read.\r\nBoy did I loath this book!  I awarded it 2 stars simply because I reserve 1 star for books that are horribly written, which this isn't.  There is nothing technically wrong with the writing.  The author can write a sentence and string several together in a paragraph.  No, I hated this book for the creepy tone and the all-knowing blather.  Call this a self-help book for the intellectually insecure.\r\nThe assumption behind this book seems to be that there are hordes of people eager to read but utterly clueless about what they should read.  Yes, should read, not want to read.  This is reading as something between castor oil and self-improvement, and reeks of the same white male well-educated superiority that was so popular in the 1950s.  If you liked Adler's Great Books, this is the book for you!  But even Adler limited his all-knowingness to the intellectual realm, instructing the rest of us what we should read.  Not Dirda!  Nope, in addition to endless lists of books we Should Read, he has advice on seemingly all other aspects of life.  \"When we consider the ways we might spend our leisure hours...we shouldn't overlook or neglect hobbies and pets.\"  \"Though books can obviously help create a holiday spirit, do not neglect traditional activities.  Listen to Christmas songs on the radio.  Go caroling...\"\r\nThere are over a hundred \"literary\" quotes that the author has lovingly saved up over a lifetime just waiting, apparently, for an opportunity to foist them upon his starved for education readers.  I'm sorry, but it simply doesn'twork.  One simply can't flit between single sentence quotes of Hobbes, Henry James and Cocteau and benefit from the sampling.  It may make the author look well-read, but it does nothing for the reader.","is_deceptive":false}

It's almost certain that I will inadvertently leave it on from time to time, draining battery life.\r\nI borrowed my daughter's 10\" pad to see about the functionality, and we agreed that the tablet holding \"stretchy bands\" worked better than it initially appeared would be the case, and the weight of her pad nicely balanced the easel function.  Without a pad inserted, it had seemed far less stable.\r\nThe case closes to a secure and thin unit that offers moderate protection.  Again, not bad.\r\nWriting this, I've already had keys stick a few times, creating text liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike this.\r\nThe instant \"Tap Launch\" feature is a nicely considered one, as are the iconographic function keys at the top of the keyboard,but overall the KeyFolio is going to offer a mixed bag of helpful features and needless frustrations to the user.  i'd say wait for the next version of this model.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"For moving, storage or utility purposes one can always go to the local grocery or liquor store and get plenty of free boxes... if you catch them at the right time. But unless you know someone there, chances are that you'll end up with a motley mess of varying size cartons that may or may not suit your needs.\r\nA personal fAVorite for general, casual storage are these . They'rs also available in packs of 5, 8, 12, 15 or 20, but do a quick math check to see which quantity fits your needs and cost per box.\r\nIf you check the product page, at the time of this review, you'll see that these cartons are available in large, medium and small sizes, along with with a small\/medium kit. This review is on the SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes, Small, 15 x 12 x 10 Inches, Pack of 10, which is the size and quantity that I've used most frequently\r\n\u25c6 Likes:\r\n+ 15x12x10-inch small size boxes after assembly; convenient and multi-purpose\r\n+ Lift-off lid, has easy to carry handles at each end; no tape required\r\n+ Double end double bottom construction; offers strength for heavy-duty moves and storage\r\n+ Good for general household items, kitchen & bathroom goods; excellent for paper files\r\n+ Easy set-up construction; lid ships attached to prevent lid loss, tears off for use\r\n+ Made from strong 32 ECT C-Flute Kraft corrugated board; reusable and recyclable\r\n+ Construction: 75% post-consumer recycled material content\r\n+ Uniform size; stackable five-high or more depending on weight of contents\r\n\u25c6 Dislikes\r\n- None at all; have reordered this size and quantity\r\nThe above items list the subjective high points of these reusable cartons. For this reviewer, it's the uniformity of the size that matters most, as they can be easily stacked. Depending on the weight of the contents, these 15x12x10-inch cartons can be easily stacked five or six high with little danger of toppling. There's a section below the handle opening at the end of each box where you can note the contents of each, which is highly suggested.\r\nWhen I received my first order as an Amazon Vine selection, I wondered how easy they were to put together. As that turned out, it was only the first one that seemed slightly tricky, and once done it all made sense. Assembly is easy, and the directions are printed on the bottom of each box. Just follow the numbered steps and all should go just fine.\r\nHints: though no tape is needed, if you plan to use these for storage, you may wish to put a small strip of standard 1.88\" to 2\" wide packaging tape over the handle openings. That should be enough to keep out any small critters that may reside in your storage area. And of course it's not advisable to store any foodstuffs other than canned goods in these cartons. Enough said on that.\r\nThese Bankers Box SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes are an excellent choice for moving and storage of your paper files, magazines, books, general household items, kitchen & bathroom goods. Just pick the size that best suits your personal needs, but remember that cartons can become heavier than you expect, especially with books and paper. The best part is that these uniform-sized boxes are very stackable, and can be used over and again.\r\nJW \u25aa 6\/20\/2015","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I never use my dishwasher because I prefer to hand wash my dishes.  Since my sink is pretty big, this has been working perfectly during the rare times when I want to use a rinse basket to drain the dishes before I dry them.  It has also been working very well as a counter-top dish drying rack as long as I put a drying mat underneath (since it does not come with a drain board).  I never liked dish drainers so I use a drying mat similar to .  However, sometimes I wash so many dishes that they don't fit on the mat. With this rack, I can get 8 large fiesta dinner dishes and a couple of small bowls upright so that I don't have to wash the dishes in shifts.  I also sometimes wash the dishes and put them in the rinse basket and let them drain before putting the entire contraption with dishes on the drying mat.\r\nThis rinse basket arrived in a box with no instructions to say what material it was made of, the measurements of the basket, or where to return for a replacement should the rack fail. The Amazon page says it's a stainless finish and has a 1-year warranty. The measurements on the Amazon page say it fits a bowl size that is 14 x 16  with center drain.  I would say that is correct since the rack measures 15 inches wide from front to back (long wise), 12 inches wide from side to side (width wise) at the widest point, and 6-1\/2 inches high if I count the feet.  The feet are rubberized so that it does not slip around in the sink.\r\nMy sink is 8 inches deep, 21-1\/2 inches wide from left to right, and 17 inches wide from front to back (18-1\/2 wide if I count the notch on the left).  I use this on the right side of my (single-bowl) sink and wash on the left side. I then store this in the top rack of my dishwasher within easy reach for when I want to use it again.  I could leave it in the sink but I do not always wash so many dishes at once. However, if I had side-by-side sinks, I would leave this in the sink.\r\nThe unit feels very sturdy, is really nice looking, and what I consider a 5-star product.  The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the following:\r\n- Utensils fall through the rack as there is no utensil basket.  I could use my dishwasher utensil basket but that would take up valuable space in this rack.\r\n- I consider the current price of $63.75 a bit steep for a rinse basket.  However, if this lasts for life then it's cheap. Only time will tell if this lasts and does not rust; I will update my review if I encounter any problems.\r\n- The lack of an information sheet with the product description and warranty information is mildly disappointing.\r\nOther than this, I feel this basket is high quality and perfect as a rinse basket.  It is even more useful for me because I also use it as a counter-top dish drainer.","is_deceptive":false}

It's not possible to hook up a normal coaxial cable even though the screen menu will allow an auto scan of cable channels.  The remote supplied didn't work at all.  Overall very poor quality product.  I've purchased many products through Amazon and never had a problem returning a defective item until now.  The solution from the Seller is to send me another remote which is not what I requested.  They will allow me to return the unit IF I am willing to pay the freight to send it back and a 15% \"restocking fee.\"  I learned a valuable lesson today.

{"text":"You can see my story below on this unit. At this point I'm changing my review to come from a different perspective.    No product is perfect. That is why customer support is so important. Every product has some percentage of units that have issues. The better designed and made the product, the lower the percentage, but the percentage is never zero. I would have to believe from the reviews on Amazon, that the Trym II has very few units that have issues. I just happened to get one of them.    That's where customer support comes in. In our house, we recently had a flagship smartphone from a well know fruit company have a swollen battery. It wasn't a big deal, because we took it down to the local fruit store and promptly got a replacement. I don't hold the faulty phone against them - because it happens. No matter how great the design or manufacturing process. In fact, I continue to buy from them with confidence, because I know they stand behind their products.    The makers of Trym II have shown that they stand behind their product, too. And I have to say, that is much harder to do at this low price point than it is for the big fruit company. If you're considering this trimmer, I can whole heartedly recommend that you purchase it. The product works great and if by some extremely small chance your unit has issues - the company stands behind it's product.    ** UPDATE 8\/22\/2014 ** I have received a full replacement trimmer (including all attachments and accessories) by 2 day UPS delivery. Another win for Pure Enlightenment customer support.    ** UPDATE 8\/21\/2014 ** I have received a tracking number for a replacement unit that is to be delivered tomorrow.    ** UPDATE 8\/20\/2014 ** I was contacted by A to Zen support shortly after my review went live. I was asked to provide a mailing address and told a replacement unit would be sent. I'll update again when I hear anything further.    Purchased on Dec 17, 2013. Died on August 14, 2014.    I actually liked this trimmer a lotwhen it was working. But an 8 month life span isn't good enough. The trimmer does look nice, but don't mistake that for a quality build. The pictures make it look much nicer than it actually is. I think what this trimmer had going for it was the simple plastic \"hair guides\". A lot of the other trimmers have a single cage that adjusts and in my experience those just don't work very well.    I'm going back to using my monstrous Wahl hair clippers on my face. Not exactly an elegant solution, but my Wahl clippers are at least a decade old. And they still work. Imagine that.","is_deceptive":false}

Schnauzer who is 11 but acts like she's 6 mo. when presented with a \"squeeker\" and my male black lab who spends hours and hours just laying and squeeking.  The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed\/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time.  I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it.  As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres.  The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us. We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My house has numerous light fixtures that require what are identified as G16.5 light bulbs. A number of these lights are on 6 or more hours per day and, until recently, I used incandescent bulbs. To save on electricity, I tried CFL bulbs, but they provided an uneven light and the spiral bulbs were visible through the light-fixture glass.    I happened upon the GE Lighting model 68169 LED bulbs at a local store, and, functionally, they have been an ideal replacement. They provide just the right amount of light, consume only 4.5 watts, and have the warm yellowish light that I prefer. Plus, they appear solidly built and I suspect will last a long time.    When I purchased these bulbs, the price charged by Amazon was $17.78, but the price at my local department store was $10.00. Hopefully Amazon will reconsider their price, as I would like to buy more of these.

{"text":"This review is for the 31\" Long Curly Gold Yellow Wig\r\nFree product provided for evaluation and review.\r\nWow, this wig is gorgeous.  It is a very nice sunny blond.  It should work for blond yellow cosplays.\r\nIt is nice and full, and the wig-cap inside it is tightly woven and lace at the crown, making it an easy wig to sew into if that treatment is needed for a costume. I also like that they made the interior a light beige and that really helps it look more natural. It does adjust inside.\r\nThe hair is quite natural looking - my natural blond hair is in picture beside it - it compares very well to natural hair, it is just a bit shinier.\r\nIt\u2019s easy to comb and work with.  The waves are loose and the cut is long layers, which give it some added volume.\r\nIt can be styled with setting lotion and a hairdryer on cool or no heat, or set and curled and left to dry.  It has retained it\u2019s out of box waviness well for me.\r\nIt should fit most adults.  It fits me perfectly and I am a cap size MEDIUM with a head diameter of 22.5.\u201d  It would stretch a bit more if needed.  It does have straps so it will adjust down to about a 21\u201d.  I think any smaller than that would need a smaller long wig.\r\nIt can be pinned if needed as the hair is a bit weighty from length, but generally it stays on very well, but it might need a few pins if you plan on being active.  That\u2019s normal for long wigs. You\u2019d want to use blond ones with this wig.  The bangs cover the hairline well.\r\nAs I mentioned, it is a bit weighty in the back from length - blonde bobby pins will help secure it if needed.  I recommend them for us with this wig.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Having only used smaller shoulder bags before and with the quantity of my gear increasing I decided I needed something different and this was a backpack or maybe a sling.  After hours of research I decided on this one... and I was a little skeptical at first... trying to imagine before I bought it exactly how well I'd like this style of backpack.  The verdict is in - I am more than satisfied with this purchase.\r\nWhat does it hold??? In my configuration it holds two bodies (one with a lens attached), three other lenses (one is a Sigma 170-500), filters and the hood for that bigger lens.  The padding inside is more than adequate and everything fits in snugly so nothing moves around. The zippered pockets hold a bunch of stuff too though nothing large.  If there were two complaints it'd be that I wish the front pocket was ~15 cubic inches bigger though it still hold two chargers, cables, lens pen, blower, etc.  Second one is below.\r\nHow does it fit???  Now on to function.  I am 5'9\" and this pack fits me very well.  There are many adjustments to fine-tune the fit and, after wearing for hours at a time during a trip out west, it never hurt.  In fact, I swear I forgot it was there sometimes.\r\nHow do I get the camera out???  It really is as easy as Lowepro's description says... just take on arm out (I use my left), swing it around to your front (I use my left though to give it a little support) and unzip the two zippers to pull the camera out from the top.  My second complaint, and this one, like the other, is minor - the zippers could be heavier gauge here.  I feel like if I rip them open fast I might break one.  As long as I am mindful of this I don't think there'll ever be a problem.\r\nHow do I change lenses???  One observation, not a complaint, is that it is difficult and awkward to change lenses while the bag is open in front of me.  I take the bag off to do this.  For landscape photography, which I primarily do, this can bea pain.  But I look at it like this - with any style of bag I am pretty sure the same action has to be taken.  I just put on the lens I think I'll primarily need and deal with changing later.\r\nWater??? There are two mesh pockets that easily hold a 20oz bottle... the thinner kind though.  I don't think it'll handle bottles the width of a 32oz. Gatorade for example.\r\nIn summary, this really is an ingenious design that works for me.  It is comfortable to wear and holds all my gear (and snugly at that).  With the main pocket at my back I know nothing can be stolen while I am wearing it.  In my opinion this pack offers solid value and function for the money.","is_deceptive":false}

There was also a pretty big indentation in the middle of the rainstick. At first I thought it was damaged in shipping but upon closer inspection it seems to be where they filled it from and set some sort of plug there.  The sound from this rainstick is okay. when tipped slowly it sounds good, but any more than a moderate cascade and it does sound \"off\".

{"text":"Congratulations, you just saved $100 from the cheaper version http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3qCuA  I purchased this TV from an authorized dealer in Seattle because I didn't want to wait. Price was the same, and I would still have to pay tax in Seattle on Amazon. I have owned the 55\" version of the TV for a month and a half.  On research I was put off by the XBR900B having better dimming and contrast control but having the speakers on the side that I find to be quite gawdy. I wish there was an intermediate between the it and the XBR850B that had the dimming but not the speakers, but I digress. I checked this out in the store vs the Samsung 8550 and 7150. Both the 8550 and XBR850B blow away the 7150 with the same content moved to each one. I personally prefer the Sony to the Samsung. The Samsung is over saturated and isn't as crisp. The Sony XBR850B just looks better to me. I also tried out the Sony XBR800B and the difference in color is very noticeable.  I started using the stand, but eventually ordered one of these to mount it. It looks GREAT mounted! http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3qDPf  The menu is easy to navigate. The settings are easy. The out of the box calibration is nearly perfect. The smart app functions work well. The 4K upscaling is incredible. It makes 1080P look like broadcast junk.  The build quality on this is excellent. The camera folds back so it is invisible from the front. I'm sure you have been reading the same things that I did on the interwebs. \"Panel Lottery,\" \"Clouding,\" \"Flashlighting,\" \"Soap Opera Effect\", etc. There is a tiny spot on the righthand side that I can see being a tad bit brighter. When I first noticed it, I really noticed it. The next day I could hardly see it, and it doesn't distract me at all. A couple adjustments to backlighting and brightness and I can't see it anymore except on boot-up. I don't notice any clouding except maybe on the boot screen, maybe. I do not see it on the netflix screen or anything like that. You can change settings and see Soap Opera Effect, but you can also change those settings back and not see it. Really, that is more of a problem with processor sharping because all LCD\/LED tvs are blurry in movement. TVs of this caliber are fast enough to sharpen and make the motion seem natural.  Where the tire meets the road, as the old saying goes, is where this TV shines. Everything is beautiful on it. Streamed Netflix is beautiful, iTunes purchases streamed by the Apple TV are beautiful, Blu-Rays in my PS4 are beautiful, and games on my PS4 are beautiful.  I shopped around. I educated myself. I kicked the tires on many TVs. I was very informed. You really have to spend a lot more coin to get better performance than what this TV delivers and the percentage better is extremely minimal for the large jump in price. At the sale price of $1750 before tax, this is really the best performance for coin spent. Black are deep, colors are vibrant, resolution is incredible, upscaling works flawlessly and makes quite a huge difference, and it is mesmerizing. I am confident that I will enjoy this TV for a long time. I highly recommend this TV. I apologize if this review doesn't have discussions on black room viewing (I turn the brightness down 4 at night and it looks great), TV lingo, what serial number panel is installed (I have better things to do with my life), or every spec of the TV (that is available online easily.) I really enjoy my purchase and think you will too, especially at this price at this time. Also, don't worry about the 4K content, the upscaling is incredible. It will take the industry years to adapt to this since it just adapted to 1080P. This TV looks better than 1080P tv while viewing 1080P content.  In summary, I now recommend all my friends check out the: http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKKvpy  I really hope you found this review helpful. Jessicaag=i60-25","is_deceptive":true}

The pieces all came clearly labeled and any holes properly drilled in the correct location. The drawers took the most amount of time to assemble as there were six of them. The main pieces slide together really easily. After you put the first side up the next step was to place the center piece in place. Prior to doing this don't forget to put in the front dresser trim pieces in place. Overall with two people you should be able to assemble this in about an hour. The total steps to assemble are 8 (including all drawers as two steps.\r\nOverall the quality seems to be really good. It is made of real wood and is sturdy.","is_deceptive":false}

The best thing I have found is just to use petroleum jelly, however that leaves your skin very sticky and unpleasant. I've tried using mineral oil as well but that is too light for me. So when I was approached to try this, I was enthusiastic to accept. This Argan oil seems like the perfect fit.\r\nThe bottle is somewhat small and due to the price, I'm hesitant to use it all over my body. The good part is you need very little to get the job done. One squirt gives you about a pea-sized amount and that is more than enough for hands and even forearms. There is a light, pleasant scent that is natural, and the oil works quickly.\r\nThe instructions say you can use it in your hair, which I did, but the result wasn't what I hoped. It made my hair look greasy - as if I hadn't washed in several days - instead of shiny and smooth.\r\nStill, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far.","is_deceptive":false}

I had another belt like this that\r\nwore out quickly because the outside black was not real leather even though\r\nthe belt was advertised as genuin leather. Only the inside of that belt was real leather.\r\nSo...\r\nI was very happy to discover that all of this belt is real leather. My only complaint\r\nis that the money pocked is a little smaller then on my old belt. BUT... I was able to\r\nput 10 bills inside of it pretty easily. So... I guess you could store up to $1000 in it\r\nif you wanted too.\r\nThe zipper is nice because it hides pretty flat. They were smart to cut out a little bit\r\nof the leather on this inside for the zipper.\r\nI would give it 5 stars if the buckle attachement to the main part of the belt felt a\r\nlittle more solid and if the money pouch were a little bigger.\r\nAs it is, I might upgrade my review to 5 stars after a month or so of wearing this belt.\r\nI was very nervous of which belt to buy and looking at the reviews helped me a lot.\r\nThe material of this belt is real leather and is very solid and looks good.\r\n>>>>\r\nOK. I have been using this thing for some weeks now and I wear it EVERY DAY.\r\nI am not particularly fat or anything so it is not holding a LOT of pressure BUT...\r\nIt is working perfectly. The area around the hole and the buckle are staying solid,\r\nwhich was my main fear from my last belt of this type. So... I am moving my\r\nreview from 4 to 5 Stars.\r\nThe belt buckle has held up totally fine and I am enjoying the adjust ability of it\r\nI list about 1 button hole of weight and if it stays off I will be shrinking the belt\r\n a bit.

{"text":"I guess I was fooled again by a cheap cable company. First off I will give it some credit for actually allowing the ac adapter to plug in snug. However after that is out of the way there are several fatal problems with this for the HP dv3-2155mx. The first and most obvious is that the white connector is not sized appropriately to fit within the slot in the computer. The second is a combination of its length and ferrite along the cable. The housing inside the laptop is not full of extra space and certainly the total length of this cable and that ferrite don't help anything. The last and most subtle problem with this fit is that the end with the jack has a bunch of wires which do not allow the left speaker to fit correctly after installation.\r\nMy DIY fix for this was to cannibalize the one part that I wanted (the jack) and solder the old connector back on this after I removed the unnecessary shrink fit and bent the terminals to allow for the clearance for the speaker.\r\nI would pay $5 or $10 more for a cable that was correct from the get go.

{"text":"The game itself is brilliant and after playing the game on the Xbox One for over 20 hours I come home excited to sink more time into the game. THAT is the game side - however the console I am playing it on is so weak that it cannot carry this games empty grocery bags. Going to limit my ramblings to 3 items - Controls - Frame rate - Graphics.\r\nControls - they changed the control scheme a little from the Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360 so that may upset some. They are slightly clunky and take some getting use to but it can be done.\r\nFrame rate - ONE WORD - HORRIBLE - the time I spent playing I always end up with watery eyes and a slight head ache. The frame rate and motion blue and resolution changes are hard on the eyes. The rate often jumps down into the 20s which feels like someone punched you right in the eyes. It's frustrating and even though its probably a little bit of optimization lack luster on the games part - the console is just to weak for this game. When you rotate the character the amount of motion blur in the draw distance is laughable, it turns into one big generic blur with no detail at all. If I didn't have a vested interest in the Gamerscore I would have not even bought this weak DDR3 all in one Xbox One. I think the frame rate drops are attributed to the dynamic resolution changes but for the love of eye sight, kill the dynamic resolution and pick a standard and stick with it. Even if its low settings its better then eye gouging frame rate stutter.\r\nGraphics - Beautiful - very detailed with overly done wind effects on trees. If they cut back on the wind effects alone I think they could have put that into the frame rate. The draw distance is immaculate but as soon as your rotate your character it disappears into a massive blur, its the worst I have ever seen.\r\nI am just an Xbox fan boy who is hating because my system of choice is such a wimp - DDR3 are you kidding me!!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I will review the hardware more than the software, considering this is an android phone.\r\nI took this phone up against its biggest competitors, namely the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the LG G3.  Both of these claim to have superior screens and cameras.  It is true that both have cameras with greater megapixels - but a million megapixel camera on a 1mm screen is still going to receive insufficient levels of light to make a halfway decent photograph.  I took pictures with all three and realized very quickly that the HTC One, with its 5 megapixel dual camera, produced higher quality photographs than the others.\r\nThen I tested their screens.  It wasn't a hard sell.  I popped up several videos from different sources (youtube, vimeo, amazon) and played them on all three.  The LG and Samsung phones had surprisingly grainy screens, while the HTC One screen was quite clear.\r\nThe HTC One is also good on size.  I do not have to strain to see anything or use the screen.  The speakers were slightly better quality than the LG and Samsung.  The battery also lasts a very long time, especially when I change it to Energy Saver mode, which makes it so it doesn't vibrate every time I type something into it.\r\nAll in all, I find that the HTC One m8 is a better smartphone.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Although it had to be tightened initially in order to release the backup key (which may have been loosened during installation), this product works like a charm. Tech support was very knowledgeable and helpful.  When I went to buy an internet programmable lock, two of the locksmiths in town said they did not sell the Resort Lock and would not service it if it ever needed servicing.  It turns out that those companies get a kick back from the monthly lifetime fee you have to pay to have the other lock. I would resent paying the obligatory 8 to 16 dollars a month for something that should be part of the cost of buying the lock. The Resort Lock is internet programmable, looks and feels sturdy, and has great tech support. Even if this lock \"fails\" before the other company's; with all the extra money, I'll buy another.\r\n*** After having this lock a while- it functions fine during the day, but is impossible to see the keypad at night. If you did not know where the numbers were on the keypad, you would not be able to enter your code without a flashlight. Holding a flashlight and entering 10 numbers (although this can be changed) is a real hardship for renters. Next time I will buy a lock with an illuminated keypad.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"My 5-year old niece LOVED creating her own markers! Kids 8 and up may not need an adult to help, but under that and an adult may need to help squeeze the ink for the child. Otherwise, children can do most everything else themselves. It's easy to use, and surprisingly not too messy at all. The ink is not washable, so you'll want to put newspaper down just in case the ink drips. Kids can learn about colors in a fresh and unique way. They can mix their own colors with a helpful chart or try their own. Plus, they can create labels on each marker to name their colors whatever they wish. And when supplies are low, you can purchase additional ink or markers separately as needed. The wait time for ink to soak into the marker is only a couple minutes.","is_deceptive":false}

There's no spare parts, so don't loose any.\r\nIt's definitely nicer to wheel around than my old pop up with 4 wheels.  I think if I'd gotten a massive laundry bag for the old pop up, that might have made do, but this is still easier to work with.\r\nI definitely enjoy just popping the bag in with the laundry and knowing I'll have a clean bag to put the laundry in to take back.  Pre sorting, instead of all in one, does save time.  Seems like it and the bags will take some good years of abuse.  I'm glad the bags have replacements.  Even though you can cram a lot into one bag, it isn't too heavy to haul one bag by itself.\r\nOne day I had to leave a wet load in a bag overnight and it didn't drip., because of some laundry problems and had to leave, instead of wait for dryer.  That said the clothes while wet didn't come out of the washer dripping, so I'm sure if I poured a cup of water in the bottom, it'd probably drip through the canvas.  Things smelled like detergent, instead of mildew, when I got to rewash the next day.\r\nThis definitely takes up some space and unfortunately I don't know if it will make it to intended place in my closet, soon and doesn't look so nice hanging out in my bedroom.  I think I've already bent the bottom wire a little, by setting the detergent\\softener on there and squeezing in a fourth hamper once, but I'm still glad it's there to support the bags and what not, compared to the competition.\r\nIt seems 3 categories isn't quite right for me, but the latter two are fewer and further between, so I guess linens\\whites can share alternate and the whites can hang sit in one of those $1 meshes for now. Also, I might get an insert laundry bag, to separate my tops from delicates.  I can probably use the existing metal hanger, to make sure it doesn't fall down.\r\nI guess the onlything I'm lacking is self cleaning wheels.  I guess I need to develop some kind of hallway wheel cleaning regimen, the hallways\/elevator are nasty in other ways in addition to the odd puddle in the laundry room, before bringing back into the apt.","is_deceptive":false}

As a person who loves photography and almost anything to do with it, this mug was a great buy.\r\nFirst thing I tried when I got it was testing if it really kept water in, as told by other reviewers. It leaks water from the drinking spout when you hold it upside down, but of course, the spout is just a hole with a cover, and why would I be drinking coffee upside down? So that didn't really matter.\r\nSo other than that, this mug was a great buy, looks realistic, holds a nice capacity of coffee, and looks really realistic.

Whether you're experienced or are new to gluten-free cooking, this book would be among my top 3 choices - not only for the recipes ( you can check out the ones I tested and the results below) but some unique special features. There are instructions on how to prepare several special flour mixes.. There is also comprehensive information about many  other aspects of gluten-free living. This is an impressive resource.    A major asset of this book are the instructions for creating  3 special baking flour blends, each with special advantages. There is the Basic Gluten-Free All-Purpose Homemade Flour Blend. Then there is  a High- Protein and Fiber All Purpose flour blend as well as another option-  a High-Protein, Low -Glycemic Flour blend.     These special mixes do NOT appear on any store shelves and are only in this book.    Listed below are the results of a round of testing recipes and the results.  Below that is a section on the special features of this book. The author is an active member of the advisory board of the Celiac Disease Program at Children's National Medical Center as well as the executive editor of Delight Gluten-Free magazine.    I do think it is important to note that if you are following a low-calorie or low-fat diet, you will need to keep a CLOSE eye on the calorie and fat counts per serving. Many are high. Even so, I found that by making a few simple substitutions . I could  lower calories and fat to acceptable levels. However, the recipes I tested for this review have NOT been altered or tweaked from the original instructions.     Also, there are a fair number of recipes here that are reasonably low in calories. These include: Veggie Pizza, Crab and Oyster Mushroom Bisque, Gazpacho salad, Spiced Kale Chips, Stuffed Mushrooms (Lemon, Ricotta and Kale filling)    On to the recipes:    Here's what we made on Day 1: We started with Herbed Hummus, anice mixture of garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, parsley, chives, and garlic. It was incredible, eaten on its own or served with gluten-free crackers. This is a recipe which is easily tweaked a bit so if you hate cilantro, as some do, add a bit more parsley or adjust to taste. We followed the recipe just as written. We devoured it within an hour.     Next on the agenda? Another appetizer, Baked Potato Chips with Parsley, Garlic and Sea Salt. This is an easy snack recipe to prepare and clean-up is minimal, especially if you have parchment paper on hand to line the baking sheets (as recommended by the author) These chips could also be a side dish with dinner. They had a nice depth of flavors, and the simple additions of garlic and parsley were just the right touches. You can modify this one easily to accommodate your favorite spices.     Moving on to dinner: we made Green Beans with Tomatoes, Garlic, and Onions. We had fresh green beans and tomatoes waiting to be used. It took less than 15 minutes to pull this one together (not counting time to remove the ends from the fresh green beans) . Fresh green beans, onions, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes. Delish!    Then came Pan- Seared Chicken Cutlets with Mushroom Gravy. Took minutes to make and the gravy turned simple  chicken cutlets into a gourmet dish.    We wanted a simple dessert for the meal's finish so we went with the Flan de Coco, easily made with staple ingredients found in our refrigerator and pantry. Very satisfying.     We didn't have time to cook many breads except for quick breads. The Peach Yogurt Quick Bread was a smash hit - as were the Oatmeal Pancakes and the Buttermilk Cheddar Breakfast Biscuits. I'm particularly interested in seeing how the sandwich bread turns out and will update this review then. To be honest, by the time we got to breads  I was feeling too tired to tackle more.    Special features of this cookbook: In addition to the standardinfo about foods which contain gluten, there is an extensive list of gluten-free ingredients, safe food additives, unsafe foods,etc. The info on Food Labeling Laws in the United States was helpful for me as well as special tips on \"Navigating the Grocery Store for Home Cooking\" .","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was quite disappointed with this product.\r\nWith the filters I was hoping that clean up would be easier than my .  -- Alas it was not.\r\nThis Melitta system also does not hold as much grounds as the Ekobrew --  it is a very small amount however makes a BIG difference in the taste \/ strength of the coffee.  So I suspect it is both the amount of grounds the cup holds as well as the Ekobrew being able to extract more flavor due to  how water passes through the grounds.\r\nI also like the Ekobrew better because it is 100% reusable.  This Melitta system while initially a lot less money does use disposable filters which add to extra cost.\r\nWhile the Ekobrew costs a bit upfront it is worth it.  I have an Ekobrew for over a year and have had no problem with it (note I have about a 12 and use 2-3 every day).  Even with heavy daily use they all still have held up well.","is_deceptive":false}

A little different from the plain black teas, these are full-bodied and full of flavor...depending on the blend.\r\nThis is why I love loos leaf teas sooo much.

{"text":"The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery\/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.\r\nAlexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).\r\nI liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.\r\nEmily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.\r\nEmily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.\r\n\"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...\"\r\nThe suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.","is_deceptive":true}

We put this mailbox up a week ago - took my boyfriend 30 minutes I think, using the adapter - available on amazon for $13; super easy - snaps onto the bottom of this mailbox & allows you to easily attach this to a wooden 4x4 post.  This replaced our incredibly old quintessential metal mailbox.\r\nI'm a serious online shopper (although oddly enough I bought this at walmart for $30) - but I tend to get anywhere from 5-20 packages a week.  Most come from UPS, but a few come via USPS.  The other day I was expecting 2 from USPS so when I saw him drive on without bringing anything up to the door I was kinda annoyed.  Until of course I went out to the mailbox - where I was shocked to see that both packages fit in this thing!!!  I bet my mailman loves me now, since he'll rarely have to get out any more!!\r\nThis will also fit most of the packages I mail out each week - before I would have to put some on the ground & leave a sticky note for my mailman pointing down - again, I'm sure he'll appreciate not having to get out and pick those up.\r\nI uploaded a pic of everything that fit in there the other day...and there was still room for more!!\r\nThis totally exceeded my expectations...I love it!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Very large and hard to handle in the front seat. It also moves the rear view mirror, so it needs to be adjusted after every use.\r\nHowever, living in Phoenix means dealing with 115+ degree days and my car is outside during the work day and when shopping. The large size means over 95% of the windscreen, plus the small side windows is covered when used. The highly reflective top side of the shield reflects most of the sun's heat and the almost white bottom reduces radiant energy transmission to keep your car cooler.\r\nThe shield is fairly stiff, so it remains in place well being held just by the shades. This really helps keep the black dash board in the Prius cooler.\r\nThis results in a significantly cooler interior temperature (I haven't measured it, but it's obvious when opening the car).\r\nThe two downsides to this shield are; 1) The top side gets very hot after being in the sun for a while, making it hard to roll up and 2) the screen itself is very wide due to the small side windows, resulting in a screen that needs to be coiled tightly to allow the velcro to hold it closed.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Halo Reach is up there with Modern Warfare 2 and Battlefield 3 as the best shooter of the xbox 360 generation.\r\nThis is simply an incredible game. The graphics are grittier. The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy.\r\nThere is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans.\r\nWhere Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game.\r\nWhat makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate.\r\nBut then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes.\r\nBecause this is, after all, a video game.\r\nStill, I appreciated that early part. I really like this game.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Very good DVD player, every output except HDMI(oh and optical audio) including Composite, S-video, Component, L&R audio and coax audio.\r\nThe NS-50 like the NS-41 not only have full display of times(chapter, title, elapsed and remaining) but hold onto remaining for titles that may not support it, as long as you activate remaining on at least one title on the disc that supports remaining time. IOW some discs may not support remaining time on the main title but things like extras may support it. If you activate remaining time in a extra, when you go back to the main title remaining will stick.\r\nAnother thing I like about the NS-50 and also NS-41(basically identical to the NS-50 from what I've found) is they both have full picture controls: Brightness, Contrast, Color, etc.\r\nLike most all Sony DVD players this one has  a 6 disc resume feature that remembers where you left off for the last 6 discs where you've saved a resume(to not save a resume simply push STOP STOP before ejecting the disc). Resuming is as simple as inserting a disc and pressing PLAY or pushing PLAY when the tray is open and it will close and start at the resume point.\r\nThis player has PLAY, EJECT, STOP, PAUSE and SKIP forward and SKIP rev on the main unit, other features are accessed from the remote.\r\nOn the remote it has speed play where you can play a disc in anywhere from .6 to 1.4x speed with audio. Full slow motion as well as frame advance is also available, not to mention time search where you can easily enter any time and the player will jump to it.\r\nI have several of these and they seem to last forever not to mention they are quite good at playing scratched discs as well as all burnt discs including DL's. Unfortunatly the only video format this player supports is MPEG2, the most common DVD standard, no Divx or other computer type formats.","is_deceptive":false}

This is a very handsome way to protect patio furniture from the weather.\r\nIncluded is a brief, but clearly detailed instruction sheet which also includes a care guide. To prevent the protective coating from being removed, the cover should not be cleaned with soap or bleach - just use a soft brush and lukewarm water. Line dry, no iron, and it should not be put away wet to avoid possible mildew. The fabric is not fire resistant so keep it away from hot grills and fire pits.\r\nThe fabric is reminiscent of a quality back-pack - nothing like the covers I've owned in the past which were more like a vinyl tablecloth or heavy drop cloth.

I use it for practice sessions on bass, bringing it into my amp through the aux input and playing through phones. It is just what I wanted - lots of different, interesting presets, controls are simple and intuitive, it's lightweight with a convenient form factor, and it sounds OK - not quite like real drums, but plenty good enough for practicing.  I gave it only 4 stars because I really think there should be slot to put in an external memory card to  store more of your own custom patterns - the six it gives you is hardly sufficient. That is not a lot to ask today even from such a moderately priced device. Still, most drum machines costs at least two or three times the price and are an overkill for my needs, so I'm satisfied this was $80+- well spent.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5\" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a \"I love my SSD\" sticker.\r\nWrite performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes (\"dd\" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB\/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5\" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place.\r\nThe \"sweet spot\" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious).\r\nThe OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage.\r\nA fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba.

The only good game in the Sonic series was Sonic 3+Sonic & Knuckles & that was just average. Sonic 1 was ok but overrated & lacks replay value, Sonic 2 was extremely easy & overrated as well, Sonic 3 was too short & a waste of time. Instead of just going ahead & releasing the full game of Sonic 3, Sega wanted to make a money grab; the other Sonic games pretty much sucked.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"These are very cute Kids Flip Flops by Mottos! I really love them! They came packaged so cute. Perfect for giving as a gift. I bought these for my son and he was so excited to get these in the mail. They come in such a colorful lunch box type box with a handle so you can carry it around. It also comes with a cute and useful black lightweight bag\/backpack to carry things in. My son is 7 years old and wears a size 4-4.5 shoe. I ordered the size 5 Mottos flip flops. I wish these were just a bit bigger for him as they just barely fit. They are a slimmer type fit which is good for some people but for my son they were a bit narrow. Definitely order a size larger and you should be just fine. From what I saw, size 5 was the largest size available for me to order so that is why I choose size 5. My son really likes the cute charm that this comes with. He got a monkey on a surfboard. It is probably really fun to buy more charms and then be able to switch them. These seem very well made and like they will last. I am happy I made the purchase!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"For my work I use a stapler a lot. I actually almost have to reload my stapler every other day due to heavy use. I owned the first version of the  paper pro which was the plastic model and found it  to be a very quality product that after 4 years of use finally broke.  I decided to try this new model since it appeared the build quality had been improved. It has a quality feel to it and is very easy to use and reload.\r\nThe first problem I encountered with this stapler occurred after only 1 week of use. The little tab at the bottom of the stapler that makes the staple bend inward after you staple popped off completely. I could probably glue it back on, but this is not something I would expect from a stapler that costs 25 dollars.  It is currently being held on by a piece of tape.\r\nThe 2nd problem I've encountered is in regard to the spring mechanism that pushes the staples forward as you use it. I don't really know what happened there but it just failed. Now to get the staples to continually feed, I have to tilt the stapler downward to get the staples to fall forward (gravity at work here).\r\nI really liked the original model and expected the same quality from the generation II model. Maybe I just had bad luck with this particular unit, but overall pretty disappointing product.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This lens took a 4 foot drop from the back of my SUV and bounced hard on concrete three times. I picked it up, horrified by what I might find. Not only did the lens still work perfectly but there wasn't a scratch on it. The lens hood has a single small scuff mark but that was all. A lens that can take this type of a beating without so much as a scratch deserves a review.\r\nPros:\r\n- This lens and the 50mm 1.8g are arguably the best value lenses that Nikon makes. The $100 instant rebates Nikon has been having on this lens recently make it a steal!\r\n- Super, ridiculously sharp from 1.8\r\n- Focus is silent, fast, and spot on with my D7000\r\n- Beautiful bokeh\r\n- 99% of the $1500 85mm 1.4G for 1\/3 of the price.\r\n- Override manual focus with a touch.\r\n- Includes lens hood\r\n- Perfect portrait lens for DX or FX.\r\nCons:\r\n- Made from durable, bounce off the concrete proof plastic instead of metal. Not sure if this is really a con.\r\nI sold my $1000+ Nikon 85mm 1.4D and have never looked back. That lens focused slower, less accurate, and wasn't quite as sharp at 1.8. The only thing better about the 85 1.4D was that it was a hunk of solid metal and this lens is durable plastic. My pictures with the 1.8G are just as beautiful as the 1.4D. I don't regret selling the more expensive lens for one second after my experience with amazing lens.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I had a rocky start with the Gatorskin, catching 3 rear flats in the first 3 weeks after putting these on (they were all legit flats; 2 goathead thorns and 1 bit of wire probably blown out of car radial tires) last October. Since then I've had only 2 flats in 7 months, though, and I ride through a lot of broken glass debris in the streets of San Diego, CA.\r\nThe Gatorskin is thick and heavy, but then I ride aluminum roadie, so I don't mind a few extra ounces. New tire takes a bit of kneading to get on, but if you knead it right you don't need to use tire levers to help. The PSI info on the tire is pretty hard to read (it's obscured by the yellow thread on the sidewall), but mine list max PSI at 120. I'm pretty light (130 lbs), though, and usually run them between 85-90 PSI for softer riding and lower rolling resistance. Never had pinched flat on them and they run great.\r\nThe rear Gatorskin developed 'square top' after about 1000 mile or so. 750 miles later it is still working well and has plenty of meat left (and I've been riding off road a bit with my road bike... They've gone up Nate Harrison Grade, Black Canyon Rd, and Mother Grundy Truck Trail without much problem (they do skid when you climb 14% grade ramps on loose gravel, but that's about it). I don't rip it down curvy mountain roads because I'm aware of the squared top rear tire and the tires handle just fine down things like Palomar South Grade Rd or Mesa Grande Rd or Honey Springs Rd.\r\nBottom line: I got these tires for their hardiness and they are indeed very hardy. They were pretty sticky when new, but that wore off within a week or two. Now they grip fine on normal road condition and even when the road is a bit wet (I go safely slow when wet, though, so I don't know how they do if you want to race with them in wet weather).","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Rita's book have been in the market for almost 15 years now and I studied it when I took the PMP exam first time in 2007. I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book. It's very new in the market so I don't think a lot of ppl know about it yet but I am 100% sure that this one will be the number one PMP book soon.  http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Project-Management-Professional-Certification-Exam\/dp\/1492310549\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381180&sr=8-1&keywords=sohel    Rita: I will consider Rita's one the second best in the market. It is some time hard to follow and digest. Questions are not as good as the first one.  Head First: I also like this book because it makes sense and easy to follow.  I think a lot of ppl will not appreciate cartoons and images in a PMP book but I liked it.  Questions are not too good but comparing others it does a good job.  http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Head-First-PMP-Jennifer-Greene\/dp\/1449364918\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381221&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+pmp","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"It's tough to find a good pair of sunglasses. After going years with cheap $20 pairs, I decided to look for a good upgrade and spend a bit extra. Well, this pair is near flawless. Great design - a lens that's large enough to not bother your peripheral vision, yet not too large to cover up your face. The sides are thick, so you get a bit of privacy from people viewing you from the side (i.e. when you take a nap on the bus.) Also, something to note is the way it sits on your face, obviously there are different shaped faces, but for me, the glasses sit far enough away so it doesn't press on your cheeks when you move your mouth or smile. The contact points are the sides of the ear and bridge of the nose - perfect. They also have a nice green tint to them, very subtle and providing a good amount of shading. They're also polarized, which adds to the cost, but increases the benefit. They also come with a large case, a little minus because it's so large, but they're specifically made for these so they won't get bent or crushed. Give these a try, I think you'll be quite happy you did.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was a bit put off when I opened this and found that it does not actually have a filter, after I came upon it from searching for filtered tank and the description lead me to believe it had one.  By that time, however, I had it together, read the instructions (which indicate that the air stone will act like a filter) and decided to give it a shot.\r\nUsing it for a betta.  Have it sitting next to a different brand tank that has a filter and advertised that two bettas could be kept separate with the included divider - doesn't work.  Hence this purchase.\r\nAfter a couple weeks of use, I have to report that his tank is considerably clearer than the one with a traditional filter.  Not being a fish tank enthusiast or expert, I have no clue how this is so, despite seeming counter-intuitive.  But it is.\r\nThe unit is a little bigger than I expected. The design for holding the air stone hose in place could be better.  The air pump is a little small and tends to move around a lot.  But otherwise I am pretty happy with the function of this tank.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So here was my predicament: I didn't really wanted to have a Wii U. I thought I had grown out of my Nintendo phase. The last Nintendo system I had was the GameCube more than 10 years ago, and I hardly ever played it. Gone were the heyday of my Super Nintendo and Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and Bomberman after-school parties. Then one day while reading up on my video game news, I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda. I swore I had never seen anything more beautiful, and instantly I was hooked. I don't remember the last time ONE game made me want to buy a game console right away. So I sought out to see which \"set\" I would buy. The standard basic and deluxe sets were out of the question, and I saw this one. Then I read up on the Mario Kart 8 set, which is supposed to be sold for $330. I searched furiously all over the Net for it. I even wrote scathing reviews for those sets on Amazon, because for some reason Amazon doesn't sell them, and worse yet, let those marketplace sellers run their mark-up scams and sell it for over $400. After two weeks and no luck - Walmart, BestBuy, GameStop, and even Toys R' Us didn't have them in stock anymore - I had to resort to buy this set from my local BestBuy.\r\nHere is my scenario to give you the best value, as of this writing - July 12, 2014. I have included direct links to the products for quicker access.\r\n1) Get this set for $300. Get it from other online stores if you have to. The cheapest Prime seller on here is $305.\r\n2) Buy Mario Kart 8 for $49-(). This game comes with a code to get you one of four free games. Since Pikmin 3-() is the most expensive right now - $50 - save that for the free game.\r\n3) If you want the Wii controller that's included in the Mario Kart set, buy Wii U Party for $43-(), which includes the controller.\r\n4) Buy the () for $9.\r\nOptional:\r\n5) Buy Zelda: Wind Waker HD for about $41-(). The Wonderful 101 is only $24(). Super Mario 3D World is $49-(), and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is $44-(). All of these games mentioned are the cheapest prices(here on Amazon) for a big online store.\r\n6) If you want the Wii U Pro controller, get the Japanese import version, which saves you about $10($40)-(). It's the exact same as the US one, only with Japanese documentation.\r\nIf you do my method, it would cost you $400 for the whole set, which includes Mario Kart 8, Wii U Party, and the Wii controller and wheel add-on. This is $70 more than the Mario Kart set, but then you don't have to wait until who knows when for that set to be available again, plus you gain Super Mario Bros U\/Super Luigi U that comes with the Deluxe Set, and Wii U Party, which make up the price difference. You can resell those two extra games if you don't want to keep them. Hope that helps! Good luck!\r\n*As of the Wii U itself, I love, Love, LOVE my Wii U! I can finally relive my childhood past. The included Mario\/Luigi games bring back the nostalgia of the original Nintendo, only this time the graphics are soooo gorgeous. I can just stare at it all day while a friend plays it. I also bought Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and the Wonderful 101, and all have been a joy and a blast to play, each in their unique way. The feeling the Wii U gives you is night and day different than my PS4 or PC. While the other two systems offer the mature entertainment my grown-up phase has moved on to, there will always be a place in my heart for Nintendo games, and the Wii U provides allthat for me, and in spades. Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was right when he said \"Nintendo\" is its own unique genre. Nowhere else can you get games like the Mario games, Mario Kart, the Yoshi\/Toad\/Kirby\/Donkey Kong games. More importantly, they all have their own unique style and feel that no other games can give you. You can read more about that article at [nintendolife.com\/news\/2014\/06\/miyamoto_thinks_that_nintendo_are_in_a_genre_of_their_own]. The closest recent game that can even say to be similar that's available across all systems is Rayman. And then there's the eNintendo shop, which further allows you to play those legacy games in their original state. So far I've bought The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past, and The Minish Cap, and both have been awesome to play, and is almost exactly how I remembered it. And finally, there's a rewards system on Club Nintendo where you earn points for registering your games and systems. These points then can be used to redeem for free games. And then, if you reach 300 points, you will be at Gold status, which would earn you further freebies at the end of the Nintendo year (June 30 of each year), and 600 points gets you to Platinum status. I registered my Wii U, Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and The Wonderful 101, and I'm already at Gold level! For more info, you can check out [club.nintendo.com\/elite-status-gifts.do].\r\nIf you were holding off on buying a Wii U - like me - well, now is the perfect time to get back into it, especially with Mario Kart just coming out, plus all those great games coming at the end of the year and next year, like the aforementioned upcoming Legend of Zelda.\r\nDEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Sturdy & easy to assemble. The chairs' seat height is too tall for toddlers, but 3-1\/2 - 4 year olds should be able to get on & off the seats by themselves with no problems. Their taller height will allow this set to be usable over a longer age span (they won't outgrow it right away).\r\nThe table leg screws that came with the package worked just fine...no replacement screws were needed to be purchased. They require a #3 phillips screwdriver to install them, which is the next size larger (fatter) than the standard #2 size most people have. If you use the correct size phillips screwdriver you shouldn't strip the heads. I think using the wrong size screwdriver is the real reason for many of the stripped screw head complaints.\r\nThe instructions say to put a tiny bit of soap on the screw threads to make it easier to install the screws (an old woodworkers' trick). I put 1 drop of liquid dish soap on the end of all the screws just before driving them in.","is_deceptive":false}

However, although my Android device is Bluetooth 4.0 smart capable (LE) the device does not have an android app that functions with it currently.

So long story short if you have an android device this will not function. You will be able to see the device in the bluetooth settings but you will not find any apps that can leverage it.\r\nThat being said I did test the device with my spouse's iPod touch and it works well if you have an apple device. There are multiple apps that support this device so you are not limited to wahoo's app (open is the way to go!).\r\nIf you own an iphone or ipod touch (last two generations) you can leverage this very nice cadence sensor. The device was simple to mount to the frame and was complete within minutes. If you want a step by step guide one is available at Wahoo's site.

{"text":"Happy Birthday to Me, Happy Birthday to....  After \"suffering\" through life with a measly 42\" 720P Plasma, http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00BB1C140  I decided to up my game so to speak. As my birthday was a approaching, I needed no more justification. Of course, Amazon'a great price certainly posed no additional barriers, so I was set.  Now before you think that I spontaneously jumped into this purchase on a whim, let me set the record straight. I've been researching an LED\/LCD alternative to my Plasma \"toaster\" for quite some time. In addition to energy efficiency, I was also looking for 1080P resolution, 60\" - 70\" in size(my wife wouldn't let me go bigger), reliability, and of course price.   I narrowed my search down to Samsung and Vizio and Vizio presented the best value, and Amazon offered the best price. Here were the other two I was looking at: http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00ID2HGQ8 http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00GTE0VJ6  As for the TV, the picture is great, even better after some tuning and using it is a breeze. I ran the HDMI cable to my surround sound receiver, and made a couple of adjustments and now I use one remote for all devices. About the only negative isn't with the TV at all, but with the LED\/LCD platform itself. It turns out that the viewing angle of these TVs is a lot narrower than a Plasma TV, so you need to sit close to the middle to get the best picture. That doesn't mean that everyone has to crowd onto the sofa, it just gets \"cloudy\" when you are way to the side.  The sound is fine. It's not spectacular and I don't know how it could be given the thickness of the TV. I don't notice it as any worse than my previous flat panel (LCD, 8 years old). My setup is such that I watch regular TV using the built in speakers then use my 2.1 stereo setup for movies, music videos or concerts, etc. However, the built in speakers a just fine for everyday watching.  All in all, I am very happy with my purchaseand the TV. I highly recommend this TV and Amazon\/. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00SMBG0S0","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I have been using screen protectors since my iphone 3G. By far these are one the best I have ever tried. Much cheaper than the invisible shield from Zagg I got back then. 3 piece under 10 bucks. You can't beat that. Quality-wise, it is at par with the major brands. I had no issue applying my first one without any big bubbles. It is very clear and while worth the $. Highly recommend.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I've been a fitness trainer for 20 years. You would think that the free weight room would be the most dangerous part of the gym. Not in my experience. The handball\/racquetball courts present the most injuries. Followed by face plants on treadmills. While broken resistance bands don't usually result in a serious injury, they do break. The potential for getting slapped in the face or eye is a real threat. One reason resistance bands break is because they get stretched too far. This SPRI Braided Xertube is extra long. Thus allowing most users to engage in exercises with full range of motion without stressing the rubber in this resistance band. The braided tubing is firmly anchored into the handles. This product will meet the needs of a taller person with long arms\/legs seeking increased resistance.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was impressed with the comfort and audio quality of the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones. The ear cushions are supple and comfortable, even for wearing for extended periods. I acknowledge that I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since 78-rpm phonograph records were the primary media, so I do have some idea what good audio sounds like. I ran through one of my favorite playlists, and the music sounded as good or better than with any of the headphones that I've used. Vocals had excellent clarity, and the range of sound was very good with rich trebles and deep, but not overpowering, bass. One feature that I haven't seen on any headphones that I've used is the bass level control, a rotating dial on the left headphone. To my ears, it had a small but noticeable effect on the bass level, but my preference was to leave it in the default position.\r\nTwo of the songs that I use to check out headphones and speakers are Annie Lennox's \"Love Song For A Vampire\" (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' \"Wipe Out\" with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff. Both sounded great with the MX7 headphones. I also played a couple of stereo setup utilities (\"Channel Balance Test\" and \"Stepped Stereo Pan Test\"), and the headphones passed with flying colors.\r\nThe headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I wore them for a hour on two occasions while evaluating them. The adjustable headbands allowed a good fit, and the thick ear cushions were comfortable. Both headbands will extend up to 1\u00bd\", and the earcups will rotate about 15 degrees horizontally for the most comfortable fit.\r\nThe headphone kit includes a 52\" cable with an inline microphone (for using with a smartphone) and 3.5mm plugs. The plug that fits into the headphones has a rotating locking mechanism that ensures that the plug can't work loose, a very helpful feature. The headphones and cable fit nicely ina zippered soft case.\r\nIn my opinion, the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones are premium-quality headphones that combine exceptional audio quality and comfortable design to give a very pleasurable listening experience.","is_deceptive":false}

However, for folks with screened pools, little debris intrusion, and a more frugal budget, I recommend the Unicel, Pleatco or Waterway cartridge replacement.\r\nBottom Line: If you've got an extra $20-$50 or have a pool susceptable to large amounts of debris, get the genuine hayward catridge.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My husband has two suits that he travels with, and we wanted a sturdy garment back to pack and store. I really wanted this to solve that problem but alas.\r\nFirst, the good: The size is just right for a suit and a dress shirt or two, at about 42\" long. The exterior pockets can hold a pair of shoes, ties, socks and a belt. It's a bit bulky to put in an overnight suitcase, so he just carried it in that case; when he used his larger suitcase, he was able to fit it. The fabric was substantial, the zippers pretty good.\r\nNow, the bad: When I opened the package, I was hit by this godawful chemical smell. There was even a little placard with the Delsey tags that said it had been treated with chemicals that the European governing bodies has identified as a potentially cancer causing agent. Uh, ooooooooookay.... Still, my husband really liked them so we agreed to air them out for a week, which dissipated the smell some; also we'd hang it in our storage closet with our winter coats rather than our regular clothes. However, the time when he traveled with the bag packed in the larger suitcase, it smelled up all his clothes and he reeked of chemical BO on that trip. And when we got back from that trip, we realized that the winter coats in the closet had absorbed the smell so now we've got to air out all those from whatever is on this thing.\r\nSo, in sum, out they go.

The LG Optimus G Pro fits well also but it requires both hands to get seated well.\r\nLoved the first so much we bought a second while it was on sale.  Mounted that on the Windshield of a VW Golf.  Again, great suction and fit.\r\nWould definitely recommend and already have to family & friends.\r\nThanks!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This steam system is great. There are so many different tips\/attachments, you can steam clean virtually any surface or object. I was extremely pleased with the results on everything I cleaned with it.\r\nI have used it for\r\n-floors\r\n-shower walls (great for removing hard water buildup up on glass shower doors!)\r\n-crevices and corners around the house where dust just accumulates and there's pretty much no way to easily clean it (until I got this steamer)\r\n-detailing\/designs in wood trims where dust builds up - especially in the bathroom where hairspray on top of dust over and over again, has built up in the detailing of wood trim and cabinet doors and drawer fronts\r\n-got all the built up grease and grime off our propane grill and it looks brand new again now inside and out\r\n-vinyl siding with moss stains\/buildup as well as general dirt and debris from outside\r\n-patio furniture\r\n-grout lines\r\n-mildew stains on a bathroom ceiling\r\n-wallpaper - old (decades old) dingy looking wallpaper that has yellowed over the years - used this steamer with the mop head and the wallpaper looks clean and bright again and it makes the room look so much brighter\r\n... the list goes on and on. Every time I cleaned something with this machine, I was on the search for something else to clean! I actually found it exciting to be able to get certain things cleaned up and looking new. The results were impressive each time I used it.\r\nI had previously used a steam mop on linoleum in my laundry area and I thought it did a pretty good job. The floors seemed clean, but there was some yellowish discoloration in the linoleum that always stayed there. When I used this McCulloch steamer on it, the discoloration mostly went away. The areas that still have the discoloration have faded out a bit and you can't see it as much.\r\nI really don't think there is anything you couldn't clean with this thing. There are so many attachmentsto be able to clean virtually anything. Even small tiny areas like buttons and crevices on your small appliances. The possibilities seem endless.\r\nAll of the attachments can be stored in the tote bag that comes with the steamer. The extending handle makes moving the steamer around very easy. You don't have to carry it  - just roll it. It seems pretty well made and solid.\r\nThis is a great machine to have because you can clean everything with it. It is definitely worth the investment. It might seem like a hassle to drag it out and use it, but once you do use it, you probably won't have to use it on the same item again for a while .. like the detailing in wood trim for example .. once you do it, it will be while before the buildup is bad enough again to need to use this steamer. My patio furniture I am planning to do yearly and it sure beats buying new furniture or cushions every year. We were going to get new grill plates for the grill this summer, but now we don't even have to because this did such a great job on it. Everything you see in the video up there on this page is true - this machine cleans just like it shows and does an excellent job.","is_deceptive":false}

I could see the indicator on the main unit blink but there was no picture. After screwing around for about 30 minutes I changed the cable and I was in business!! Yes I keep one around just for that reason..\r\nNetwork set up on my wired network was automatic and did not require me to intervene. It looks as though a static address could be set if it was desired.\r\nI spent some time playing with set up so I was familiar with the menu flow. Then streamed a movie from Amazon Prime!!\r\nThis should be a sweet device!! It downloads the control codes for your cable box, satellite dish and television and many other devices and gives control of them all. I installed and configured an app to view my networked security cameras. Keyboard, mouse, web browser and Android apps. Keyboard controls for most of the necessary functions of attached devices.\r\nI'll update the review if there are any problems longer term.\r\n2013_02_27\r\nLong term downloading became a problem and playing streaming videos got to be tough. The \"aw snap\" the \"\" plugin has encountered a problem is WAY TO COMMON. On top of that I believe it was already obsolete when I bought it. No updating of the OS seems to happen. The plug in crash is a known problem and I have been able to make none of the work arounds happen. The fan grinds along 24\/7 and is becoming loud enough to be \"very\" annoying.\r\n2013_05_20\r\nOk so I have finally tired of the constant crashes of the plugins for streaming video from Amazon. After the latest update the video from Amazon would not stream at all. Since I'm a Prime member that would be really nice to have. Looks like an ongoing problem between Flash and Chrome. Who knows.. Pulled the top off and blew out the fan to no avail.\r\nI bought a ROKU and it's working out of the box. No hassle, no crashing, nofan.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I received a free item to review.  The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode\/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn\u2019t make for an easy grip \u2013 you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don\u2019t like that I can\u2019t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first \u2013 that\u2019s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I\u2019d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn\u2019t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it\u2019s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they\u2019re at different price points and it\u2019s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two \u201cC-Pop\u201d recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit\u2019s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound.

{"text":"This is a very handy Preparedness option if you want to fill your bathtub with safe, potable drinking water (in advance, while water pressure is still available). These are widely offered all over the Internet at prices from $18 up. These are essentially just giant vinyl bags with a nozzle\/cap closure. The same exact bag seems to be sold under various brand names, but it's the same product.    I like this simple concept. Here are some points to consider:    1. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Once full (even partially full), this thing will weigh a ton. Completely full, 100 gallons weighs 800 pounds.  It's not portable. You're not going to be lifting it out of the tub and carrying it anywhere. The vinyl would likely not survive 800 lbs of stress even if you had the manpower to lift it.    2. Once it's in place and full, your bathtub (and\/or shower) are out of action and can't be used for anything else...like bathing, or decontaminating anything. So this works best if you have multiple bathrooms\/tubs in order to spare one for water storage.    3. These are one-time-use items. Once you use it, and empty it, the vinyl bag is just too large to dry thoroughly after it's emptied. So there's that. On the other hand, 100 gallons of water (at 1 gallon per person per day) is a great resource.    4. If portability is a concern, you can achieve much the same thing using clean large plastic storage bins (Sterilite brand or similar) and stacking those in the tub. Same concept but capable of being moved if necessary.    SUMMARY: If you have a bathtub you can afford to dedicate solely to water storage in an emergency, this is a fast, easy, simple and clever solution to hold 90 days+ of survival water for one person, 45+ days for 2 people, etc. It pays to comparison shop on price. It's large, and a challenge to dry to dry out hygienically for possible re-use (consider a blow dryer and a funnel?), so I consider this a 100-gallon 'disposable'. On the whole, at around $20, this is a great solution at a low price for 100 gallons. Just make sure you have a tub you are willing to dedicate solely to water storage.    Hope this is helpful. Stay safe and happy trails, everybody.    PS: I just read reviewer Jennifer Gonzales's comments that people often overlook that they already have a ready source of clean emergency water in their home water heater. That's very true, and good to remember. There are lots of good how-to videos on YouTube on this--you'll just need to know in advance which valves are involved, and most units will need a crescent wrench to open the faucet type drain at the base of the heater.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a fine biography, revised (as others have mentioned) and graced with pictures and Forest's own reminiscences.  It is very well written, and covers the whole breadth of her amazing life.  It is very fair: it doesn't whitewash Day's crankiness or stubbornness or (to an outsider) her willful adherence to a Church that bears no relationship to anything Jesus would have had any part of, on any reasonable reckoning. The community of spirits and the communion of souls are more present in the Catholic Worker's activities in the soup kitchens than in all the popery and bishoprics.  Still, if it was good enough for St. Francis, then it seems to have been good enough for Dorothy Day.  Whether it is worthy of them is a deeper question.\r\nWhole sections of the book resonate with the dire situation of the American poor today in the New Depression; and also remind us of the vast political struggle that went on then to wrestle even some kind of mercy from the capitalist machine.  It reminds us of how much people suffered to bring about the basic safety net that ideologues are working day and night to dismantle in favour of the mercilessness of the harsh Gods of the Blessed Free Market.  And how much of that suffering is now, and will likely have to be suffered all over again.\r\nThe book also reminds us of the stultifying world in which Day operated, and the dreariness of much of it: the drab buildings, the endless dishwashing and sweeping, the narrow mindedness.  It also reminds us of how early Day and her colleagues were in so many protests: anti-nuclearism, race and Vietnam being only a few of them.  It would be a good book to give to contemporary activitists:  perhaps the strongest message in the book is the need for order and discipline throughout both the dreariness and the wildness; and the essential role of daily prayer (of whatever kind) to keep one going in the midst of the burdens of chaos and failure on many levels.","is_deceptive":false}

Lol, that's all I really liked about it. Well, and the price of course but it was money wasted because I won't likely wear it!\r\nThe 02 Medium was quite orange on me. I'm of Southeastern descent, for reference, I have a bit of an olive undertone and usually wear medium beige tones... This color would match well on someone who has done a good share of fake tanning.... Noticeably orange.\r\nI have combination oily skin. Slightly oily in the T-zone and normal everywhere else. For me, this product went on too dry. Maybe because of the SPF but so dry, it was difficult to blend. Being that the color was dark for my skin, I warmed it up in my fingers to apply it thinly but still it didn't apply evenly.\r\nMy biggest gripe was that I was wearing a white tee and quickly found that it doesn't set well. It rubs right off with hugs, drips off if sweaty, and just didn't have any staying power. I hadn't used my usual setting spray or any powder though because I quickly found this product disappointing and decided to not spend more time on it.\r\nIt did cover well without using too much product but as said, was too dry for my liking. It made my skin feel nicely tightened though and maybe with more use would have more benefits but I'm not feeling led to buy more in a lighter color.\r\nSince initially trying it, I've gotten more sun and developed a nicer tan. I tried this again but the hue was still just too orange. I'd use it under my eyes for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.\r\nUploaded some photos for reference. Unfortunately, for me, this product is not a keeper. Hopefully this might help someone. Wish it worked better!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"That review title above is a straight up fib. It's not at all difficult to predict all the plot twists in DON 2. But so what? For fans of Shahrukh Khan and for those who relish slick action thrillers, DON 2 checks all the boxes. It's been five years since the events in DON, five years since that shocking final reveal. But some things don't change. These days, our guy is still running game on the underworld, still outfoxing the badge and his competitors. The woman he betrayed, Roma Bhagat (Priyanka Chopra), is now an Interpol officer. She's obsessed with nabbing him.\r\nThe film opens with Don holding it down as the undisputed kingpin of the Asian underworld, except that he's now got his eye on a take over of the European drug cartel. On the French Riviera, the European bosses attend an emergency meeting to discuss Don's recent actions. Don is jeopardizing their drug empire by undercutting the asking price of their product. What they decide on is inevitable.\r\nBack in Malaysia, Don gets wind of the contract on his head in the rudest of manners. There and then, he determines to be a free man once and for all. He sets into motion one of those whirlwind capers, key elements of which hinge on the springing of his old enemy from prison (Boman Irani) and a daring heist in Berlin. But Don finds himself navigating a nest of vipers, his accomplices composed of deceitful villains. With law enforcement nipping at his heels, has Don at last bitten off more than he can chew? Or does that iconic phrase still hold true? \"Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkim hai.\" Translation: \"It is not just difficult to catch Don, it's impossible!\"\r\nIf you're anticipating a retread of the 2006 film, you need to turn in your anticipating badge. For one thing, there aren't so many swerves in this one. Don does assume a disguise, but it's not as relevant to the plot as much as it is a chance to showcase Hrithik Roshan in a cool cameo (Hrithik even dances with Priyanka).And if that really is Hrithik saying Don's dialogue, then big ups to him for nicely matching Shahrukh's voice and cadence. Don is so gifted, as part of his disguise, he grew a few inches.\r\nI thought Priyanka Chopra did well in a role that required her character, Roma, to be conflicted. Don is so magnetic that Roma still can't help but feel that attraction, never mind that Don had betrayed her, never mind that he'd murdered her brother. Thankfully, the film keeps this sub-plot mostly on simmer, never allows it to take over the narrative. Lara Dutta has a lesser role, filling in for Ishaa Koppikar as Don's most trusted companion. Both women look absolutely devastating!\r\nThe manly man's credo: Give me my popcorn and a comfy sofa and babes to ogle and lots of fight scenes and explosions... and I'm good. Because sometimes and maybe most times, I dispense with the artsy-fartsy stuff and I demand to be entertained by a loud action blockbuster. DON 2 lacks the smarts and fascinating twists of the 2006 film. And I don't know that it was a sound move to inject a sliver of conscience into Don. What made him unique was that he was an unrepentant anti-hero, a straight up, no good villain. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Shahrukh Khan's larger-than-life charisma and his showmanship are stamped onto the screen and your eyes are glued to the guy. Shahrukh also performs his own stunts, again perpetuating the notion that absolutely no one can fill his shoes. I guess, one other contention is that I prefer Don to apply his wits to achieve his ends. Here, he frequently resorts to action hero methods. Ultimately, the 2006 film had built up so much cachet I can't dog on its sequel too much. DON 2 is the Hindi version of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. It's over-the-top and preposterous and great bloody fun. As a fan of Bollywood cinema, I think it's always a treat whenever Boman Irani plays the bad guy. Whether in drama or thriller or comedy, Boman Irani is effortless. There aren't alot of musical numbers here (I think, three). But the tracks all carry strains of \"Main Hoon Don,\" a club banger from the 2006 film and one of the most addictive, catchy Bollywood songs ever. Okay, another beef? How much more clever would it have been if, instead of Hrithik Roshan, it was Abhishek Bachan whose face Don assumes? Abhishek looks enough like his dad, Amitabh, who played the original Don in 1978, that the reference would've been awesome.\r\nWhat I have is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, available with English sub-titles and the option to jump to any of the film's three musical segments (this last feature is also available on Disc 2). Disc 2 has the following bonus features:\r\n- Making Of featurette (mostly in English, running time 40 minutes)\r\n- Songs: \"Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo,\" Hai Ye Maya,\" \"Dushman Mera\"\r\n- (Promotional?) Music Video from DON 2 featuring Shahrukh Khan: \"Mujhko Pehchaanlo\"","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"The Smead Hanging Folder without Tab, Letter, 2-Inch Expansion, Assorted Colors is a great addition to any file drawer. They are both big and sturdy. I've filled them to the limits of their width without the folder bowing at the bottom. They come with nifty reinforcement strips that you place in the bottom and these seem able to hold any weight you can fit into the folder, including instruction books and manuals (I've tested it).  Another reviewer complained that papers get bent or bowed by the reinforcement strips but I haven't had that happen yet to me. The strip is as wide as the folder's base so I can't imagine it would happen without over-stuffing the folder.  The price is high (almost $40) for 25 folders and I don't know that I would have spent that much on these sight unseen. Havin been able to see them for myself I can see how useful they can be but I'm still not certain I'd pay that much. On the other hand, I can't imagine needing more than 25 of these unless you use them in a business setting so perhaps it's not such a terribly steep investment looked at that way.  I give them a 5 based on usefulness and sturdiness. I would probably give them a 4.5 if permitted to account for the steep price.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Our 8 yr. old daughter wanted this so much for Christmas. She couldn't have it at the time because of the absurd price Amazon had it but... thanks to Amazon's independent sellers, we were able to obtain a 'like new' copy which was indeed 'like new' for a fraction of what the game is currently listed at.  To make this short, this game is over in a couple of hours. Our little girl finished it in one evening playing together with a visiting friend. They liked it while it lasted because they could learn what planning a wedding could be like: they had to go to the music store, stationary store, book a venue, visit a boutique an so forth. But... there's not much to do other than picking items from a list while the game keeps track of things done and things to do. Once ready, there's the ceremony where your DS lets you take pictures to share with friends. If a fellow DS owner happens to be nearby, you can exchange wedding gifts with them - and that's okay because, magically, the gifts you give them don't disappear from the inventory. It's all over quickly.  There should be some replay value because there are several preset brides you can work for: lawyer, actress, designer, photographer, veterinarian... and you can do a custom bride but in practice our girl didn't feel like playing it again with a different bride and I don't believe she'll play the game ever again.  If it was for me, I'd give this game a 2 stars for \"I don't like it\" but the person who actually played it said it was 'OK' and that's 3 stars are for.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Lambda-Class Shuttle (a.k.a., Imperial Shuttle) is one of four \"Wave 3\" expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game. I think there are several good reasons to add a couple of this ship to your Imperil fleet.\r\nAs with the HWK-290, it should be kept in mind that the Lambda-Class Shuttle is mostly  a support ship (but, unlike the HWK-290 it is not almost solely a support ship and it definitely has some nice advantages of its own). It should also be noted that this is the only ship in Wave 3 that comes on a large base (which can make it a bit more difficult to maneuver).\r\nThat said, the base stats for this ship range from poor to excellent overall, and include 3 attack dice (excellent for Imperials), 1 defense dice (the worst yet for an Imperial ship, but the lots of hull and shield will help make up for this), 5 hull (very good or better for Imperials), and 5 shields (excellent for an Imperial ship). All Lambda-Class Shuttles also have the focus and target-lock actions (making this the second Imperial ship without the evade action, and the Imperial ship with the least number of possible actions overall).  They can also be upgraded in several ways with a variety of previous and new modifications, including a crew upgrade.\r\nSecond, you get 4 new pilots (including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities).  Pilots include:\r\n(1) Omicron Group Pilot, a level 2 non-unique pilot that costs 21 points.\r\n(2) Captain Yorr, a level 4 unique pilot that costs 24 points, who has a support special ability that reads, \"When another friendly ship at Range 1-2 would receive a stress token, if you have 2 or fewer stress tokens, you may receive that token instead.\"\r\n(3) Colonel Jendon, a level 6 unique pilot that costs 26 points, whose support special ability reads, \"At the start of the Combat Phase, you may assign 1 of your blue target lock tokens to a friendly ship at Range 1 if it does not have a blue targetlock token.\"\r\n(4) Captain Kagi, a level 8 unique pilot that costs 27 points, whose support special ability reads, \"When an enemy ship acquires a target lock, it must lock onto your ship if able.\"\r\nThird, it also includes 12 upgrade cards (most of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released): (1) ST-321allows an Imperial Shuttle (only) with this modification to acquire a target lock on any eligible ship on the board even if they would normally be considered out of range for a target lock; (2) Intelligent Agent -- a 1 point crew upgrade that allows you to look at the movement dial of one enemy ship at range 1-2 at the start of the activation phase; (3) Darth Vader -- a very interesting 3 point unique crew upgrade  that allows you to take 2 damage to cause a ship you just attacked 1 critical damage; (4) Navigator -- a 3 point crew upgrade that lets you change your maneuver dial to another maneuver with the same baring; (5) Weapons Engineer -- a 3 point crew upgrade that was also released in wave 2; (6) Rebel Captive -- a nice 3 point crew upgrade that requires the first ship to attack you during round to suffer one stress token ; (7) Flight Instructor -- a 4 point crew upgrade that lets you reroll one of your focus OR blank results depending on the defenders pilot skill; (8) Advanced Sensors -- an interesting 3 point upgrade that lets you do your action before rather than after you move, which will come in very handy if you think  you'll end up colliding with a ship or asteroid; (9) Heavy Laser Cannon -- a 7 point secondary weapon upgrade that was also included in Wave 2; (10) Sensor Jammer -- a very interesting 4 point upgrade that allows you to change one of the attackers hit results to a focus (and also prevents them from rerolling this focus); and (11) TWO copies of Anti-Pursuit Lasers - an awesome 2 point upgrade that lets you roll one attack dice against enemy ships that end by touching your base.\r\nAs with all expansions, this one includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play). In fact, another very interesting things about this ship is the maneuver dial... it is the first and only (as of the time this review was written) to include 0 movement (i.e., you can take a stress token and not move at all).  This will come in very handy if you want ships to crash into you so you can get free shots off with Anti-Pursuit Lasers.\r\nGiven all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side (especially the upgrades, many of which can be used with other ships), I think it is a very worthwhile addition to the game. I bought 2 for now, but could see owing up to 4 at some point depending on how they play over time. Definitely take a look around online as you can often find these for less than $20 each with free shipping if you buy enough.","is_deceptive":false}

Any \"leaking\" liquid is most likely due to using it in the shower and not wiping them down before packing or not turning then upside down when recapping them.\r\nI've taken these on several international\/overseas flights and have really enjoyed using them.  While expensive, I've now never had to think about travel bottles ever again.\r\nImprovements I'd like would include easier to read labels\/more options\/better labeling system (I'll probably break down and just print labels to stick on the lids).  Maybe an optimized, airport friendly container; they're a bit tight in the airport-provided plastic bags with their awkward shapes.","is_deceptive":false}

She tried a few different methods like putting a rolled up blanket between the baby and tray but it still made quite a mess!

This is NOT for everyday carry, as I usually wear jeans or a belted pair of shorts. If worn under pants with a belt, you wouldn't be able to get at this holster easily.

The pedal action is buttery smooth, tension adjustment is nice, really like the design of the bottom cymbal angle adjuster (no probs. w\/ it backing out, all metal, and it's easy to get to), 15\" upper rod leaves space for tight overhead clearance and has a \"clean\" look, no problems w\/ the stand staying put despite having a small foot print behind the kit and the locking clutch is a nice touch especially for \"harder\" players.","is_deceptive":true}

These shoes are liking having 4WD for your feet when ascending and descending, steep, slippery, muddy slopes which is exactly what they've been bred for. I like them better than my Salomon SpeedCross 3's for OCR's because of the Fellraisers lower drop and more stable base. For regular trail races, I prefer my SpeedCross 3's. I can't recommend these enough if you are planning to use them for Mud Runs. If you're just looking to run gravel and relatively smooth, non-tehcnical trails, you may want to look at a shoe that may provide a bit more comfort as the ultra aggressive lugs on the Fell Raiser don't necessarily lend the shoe to the softest of feels, but they are still adequately cushioned.","is_deceptive":false}

The plastic cutter strings are extended not by bumping the machine on the ground but by hitting a switch on the side of the machine.  I bumped the machine on the ground several times before convincing myself to use the switch to extend the string.\r\nThis is a good trimmer that offers excellent performance; however, it may not be the trimmer I use personally because it is heavier than my old trimmer.  I am much smaller than the average American, and adding extra weight to the trimmer means, for me, that the machine is more difficult to control and that I tire much more quickly when using the trimmer.\r\nFor small folk, this may not be the trimmer you want.  For everyone else, however, you'll be pleased with the machine and with your results.\r\nFour Stars!","is_deceptive":false}

The original only had pieces of plastic covering the holes, but our Expedition has similar lights and these are much nicer looking than the original equipment. We took a picture of the before and after (different cameras and different sun lights, so paint looks different), and I can tell you that these lights sparkle like a diamond in a ring.

{"text":"This is a very sturdy, pet carrier that allows the pet to see everything that is going on, at all times.  This is great, unless you have a scared pet who wants to hide from all of the chaos of the scary unknown.\r\nI love the soft sheep skin bottom, and so does my cat.  I opened the main door, and set this carrier in the living room so she could explore and get comfortable, on her own.  I threw one of her toys in there, and she ran right in.  There is a small and a large strap on the carrier, so you can either carry it, or put it on your shoulder.  The top zipper flap is small, so removing or placing an animal in the carrier, isn't feasible.  I believe it is built so that you can give your pet food, or pet her if she is stressed.\r\nThere are 2 mystery items on this carrier, and I was irritated that it didn't come with some kind of pamphlet.  There is a strap with a hook that hangs inside the carrier.  What is this for?  I have no idea.  There is also a velcro flap on one side of the inside of the carrier floor, and one on the other side.  What are these for?  They don't work to hold down the removable floor.  It would have been nice had there been some explanation on paper, or on this website.  The large size is small.  I have a 12 pound cat, and she fits in it, but with little room to move around.\r\nI love how you can fold this up for easy storage.  It is lightweight and practical.  I have a very skittish cat, so normally she hides in her heavy plastic carrier, with a towel over her whole body.  This might not be a good fit for her, because she can't hide in this thing.  However, if you are looking for an inexpensive, sturdy carrier, then give this a try!","is_deceptive":false}

This makes it difficult to eject him. It's worth picking up the extra minions; Eject & Ramhorn and Rewind & Sunder. They all are good in disc mode and fit well with Blasters chamber feature.

{"text":"This is an excellent tool!\r\nI was originally given a Craftsman Bolt-On as a gift about two years ago, and have since purchased or been given most of the different tools that go with it\r\nUnfortunately, this summer, the motor on the Craftsman burned up. Sears\/Craftsman said \"tough luck\" because they only offer a 1 year warranty. I've always been a Craftsman fan, but this combined with the lower price of the Matrix set led me to make the switch. Black & Decker gives a 2 year warranty and their batteries are actually compatible with other tools they make.\r\nAll of the attachments, the batteries and chargers are compatible between Craftsman and Black & Decker.\r\nThe size and cost of this set is its real advantage, compared to a set of similar tools. I can throw a drill driver, impact driver, oscillating sander, skill saw, reciprocating saw, jig saw and compressor in a small bag and carry it with me easily.\r\nThe strength of the batteries is impressive as is the charge time.\r\nI got this particular drill in some freak sale of $20 + $7 shipping. As far as I can tell it is brand new and works flawlessly. It took two weeks to get but it was well worth it!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I installed the Delta stem riser on my 2013 Motobecane Fantom 29er COMP. Before I did, I asked bike shop personnel about changing cables. One guy said that with a stem riser, 90% of bikes require cable replacement. I was reluctant to pay to have it done. Also I was reluctant to replace the cables on my own; never tried, nor did I want to on my brand new $700 bike. But I bought it anyway. I decided to install it and then figure out the cable issue. When I did, there was no cable issue. Even at the highest position, the handlebar turned fine. All the cables still had slack. I beat all the odds. Ever since my riding has become much more comfortable. I can sit upright much easier, with less strain on my back and neck. For those mountain bikers that do more back or open road riding than switchbacks, it definitely improves the quality of the ride. I would buy it any day. Lastly, installation was quick and simple.","is_deceptive":false}

The first would have been more information about his relationship with his two children. And the second would have been more information about the relationship with his wife, Nell.\r\nOtherwise, this is almost like being a friend of Wooden's during most of his life. It had quite a bit on information about his early life, his time at Purdue and the period at ISU, etc. I live on the south side of Indianapolis and worked for about a year as a pharmacist at the hospital in Martinsville. One of my best friends from Westfield High School was a big fan of his growing up - had his success pyramid on his bedroom wall, etc.\r\nSince I played football, track and baseball, I was mainly interested in his teams always wining the NCAA men's Basketball championship, seemingly every year. I lived barely a hour from Purdue while growing up. Once married I live barely an hour from where he grew up. When I attended my one year at ISU I was unaware that he had coached there for 3 years. And I graduated from Butler University and I knew Tony Hinkle quite well. I grew up with Bobby Plump and Hoosier Hysteria.\r\nBut I never knew of his glory days playing at Purdue nor of his barnstorming days in the early pro leagues.\r\nThis book is rich in detail and I highly recommend this book to nearly everyone. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this book. Coach Wooden is quite simply an icon in Indiana as well as the sports world. They put up a ugly (to me anyway) statue in downtown Indianapolis a few years ago in his honor. It depicts him crouched down in a time-out huddle with only the legs of his players as he is giving them directions.\r\nI would rate this book a very high 9.25 to 9.75 out of ten!!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is an excellent device that seems to have all its bases covered.  For bathroom use, you can set humidistat and sensitivity, to fine tune how quickly your fan comes on during a shower and how long it stays off afterward.  These dials may also need to be adjusted depending on bathroom size.  You can also press the button to turn the fan on manually.  This then activates the adjustable timer (10-45min) countdown.  This manual mode is overridden when the sensor picks up humidity.  So, you could turn the fan on before you get in the shower, and then it will shutdown automatically afterward when the excess humidity is gone.\r\nThey say that once you open the door to the bathroom, the sensor reacts differently.  As I like to leave the bathroom door open after a shower, I do wish there was a minimum run time you can set that would only count down after the humidity level returns to normal, to make sure you ran the fan long enough.  You can sort of do the same thing with the dials mentioned previously, but I think this way would be more surefire.\r\nIf you don't have proper attic ventilation, and therefore have a fan in your attic window or through your roof, this device can be set up to cycle hourly in 10-45 min. increments as desired.  This could help you save on your electricity bill if your fan is providing more ventilation than necessary when run 100% of the time.  Ideally, you'd probably change your cycle time with the seasons.\r\nThe device works very well.  As another reviewer warned, you do need full wiring to use this product, so check that out before taking on a retrofit installation.  Besides that, it offers a lot of different settings to allow this to be controlled in almost any way you like.  It's certainly the best type of fan control that I've seen available, and especially good if you have kids (or other people in the house) that don't like to run the fan with a shower for whatever reason; this can be set to force its use.  Fansin bathrooms have become code in most places for good reason; my house used to have no fans and the damage to the walls and everything else in the vicinity was quite tangible.  The entire house is in better shape and much more comfortable after installing and always using good ventilation fans.","is_deceptive":false}

No necklaces. He's just not that guy.\r\nOur teenage son takes after his dad...\r\nBut these rings from King Will look like stuff they both wear, looks like they could have been made from the metals in the tools and car parts they play with, so I got one to test the waters and he loved it. Am very glad that I did, and now we are back for a couple more.\r\nThis particular ring is classy looking, though much more like a traditional wedding band in shape, color and design. Still, it is different enough that he is not complaining about it and even says that it looks nice. so far the King will ring that he likes the best is (), but they all look great on him.\r\nAwesome band-style look. Smoothed edges for comfort. Nice hefty weight (about 16 grams or about 6\/10ths of an ounce, per our postal scale). I like this ring and I like it on him.\r\nAs an aside, the gift box is one of the nicest little boxes I have seen so I will be keeping it for use with my own rings.\r\nWhile the Amazon listing notes that this ring is covered by a \"100% Money Back within 14 days Guarantee\", the ring comes with a \"Service Commitment Card\" that notes \"Happy customers mean the world to us\" while providing an email address and telephone number to call if there are any problems, promising \"a full refund or exchange for a new one\". To us, that is an excellent commitment to customer satisfaction that we hope never to need to use... but if we do, I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this awesome ring gratis from the seller and, after trying it, my husband is no longer objective about it at all... he really likes the rings from this company. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.\r\nIf you are looking for a ring for your guy, one of this color, price, style and construction, then this ring might be exactly what you are looking for based on my experience with it.\r\nRecommended.\r\nGo for it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Joanna Barsh, a 30 year veteran of McKinsey, takes the reader on a journey through self paced and extremely insightful exercises to arrive at a better place for leadership and self awareness in this easy to read but challenging book.  Barsh begins by focusing on the element of centering.  Centering crossed my path as \"centering prayer\" several years ago, and revolves around self awareness, stillness and connection as well as grounding.  Barsh crosswalks this meditative practice to an active implementation in \"Centered Leadership\".\r\nThe book begins with a useful introduction to centered leadership, and an introduction to the five components which make up the centered leadership facets:\r\n* Framing - self awareness, pausing and adaptability\r\n* Connecting - Trust relationships, networks and community, sponsorships\r\n* Engaging - Presence, ownership and taking risks and action\r\n* Energizing - Energy balance, recovery and sustaining practices\r\n* Meaning - Happiness, core strengths and purpose\r\nBarsh then walks the reader through each of the five elements, accompanied by a series of self reflective and team exercised designed to awaken and develop each of the five facets.  At the end, she hopes that he reader will have improved their leadership impact, self-fulfillment and resilience.\r\nUltimately, the book is a useful tool - as much for self awareness and self development as to provide enlightening leadership techniques.  Barth seems to embrace the approach that to lead, one must first take care of themselves and understand (perhaps even \"center\") themselves for maximum effectiveness.  It is a worthwhile read, and the exercises are thought provoking and useful.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I needed something different than my http:\/\/fave.co\/1bA46bU  So I got this http:\/\/fave.co\/1bPP7LH  I was able to use these diamond bits to make holes in old bottles, so we can use them for decor lights. These bits served my purpose very well. Diamond drill bits are much much better than the carbide spade bits. Now the drilling is faster and I don't break any more bottles. I use running water to keep the bit cool, and each bit lasts up to 20 bottles (depends on the bottle obviously). I say, this is a good deal based on the price.  I am a pretty novice DIY homeowner. And the project I had was installation of a reverse osmosis faucet. I purchased this set to drill a hole in my precision granite countertop. As a first timer, I took my time with the hole saw and tried my best to keep the tip of the tool cool. It tool me almost 45 minutes to go through the 1 inch thick granite but if I did it again, I can do it faster.

{"text":"When it comes to traveling, my family and I love to take off often just to see the world out there. But the stress of packing is one thing I hate about these trips. We don't seem to be able to gather our stuff together in order. Sometimes, we just can't find where we placed our passports or other convenient items when we need. It is usually a distressing thing for me to keep searching for an item, unloading and reloading entire luggage only to discover that what we are looking for is hidden somewhere inside one if the bags.\r\nBut recently a friend told us about these packing cubes. We ordered it and used many of the 4 set pcs during our last trip. It was fun! The relief was unimaginable. We had all our stuff packed in different cubes in such a way that we can easily identify and retrieve them. Even at the airport, the guys did not have to keep running their fingers through our bags as everything was relatively easy for them to check. The trip was a breeze! My kids loved these packing cubes so much. Each three of them had their own packing cubes with their items kept separately.\r\nMy wife love to pack her make-up in the smallest size, her other intimate items in the smaller ones and then arrange her stuff in order using the remaining ones. The different sizes make packing different items easy. On returning from our trips, we find these packing cubes even more useful. We are able to separate dirty clothes from the clean ones and thus avoid all the disappointments that come with opening your bags in the public.\r\nThese packing cubes truly make traveling very convenient. It is worth every penny you can spend on it. You cannot put a price on convenience! I will buy more of it and give out to friends. The fact is that many people are not really aware of this type of product and what it can do for them. In a very mobile world, organization is essential. This is where these packing cubes come to play. You can never go wrong with these packing cubes and all theconvenience that come with.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I have been an avid Amazon shopper for many years, but this is the first product I am writing a review for, because of how impressed I am with the shoe.  First off, I have had fairly extensive knee problems for many years, and have had eleven surgeries, gone through hours of physical therapy for these and for ITB syndrome, etc.  To some degree the fact that I continue to be a runner is maybe a bit hard-nosed and stubborn, but I love it too much to think about giving it up.  I've tried various shoes (about 12 different pairs of runners in the past three years alone), various knee braces\/apparatus\/sleeves, and varied running environments from rubber track to road to trail.  I've always been an Asics guy, but have also tried New Balance, Adidas, Brooks and Nike.  I've always tried to find a shoe with extra cushion, thinking it would absorb impact rather than distributing it to my knees.  This is my first Mizuno product, which I decided to try after my Uncle recommended the brand to me based on his love for the Wave Riders; I was a bit leary, having tried multiple shoe brands, and decided on these Wave Creations based on his, and other reviews.  This shoe does NOT offer my heel that super cushiony feel yet gives me the support I need to run pain-free, even days after my runs.  I've begun to think that, like my sleep number bed, which I inflate to a more firm setting when I have back pain, that perhaps my thinking with shoes has been wrong all along, and that the more firm shoe is actually offering me more support in a similar manner.  If you're like me, and have been continually frustrated with knee\/ITB difficulties, consider this shoe; it may not be for everyone but it's done wonders for me.  I have a high arch and am an under pronator; I am 5'11\" and at the time of this writing weigh an even 200 lbs.  I recommend purchasing this shoe in a 1\/2 size larger than your regular sneaks, but then I recommend the same for any running shoe as it had been advised to me by a professional several years ago and I've always stuck with that.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This toy is adorable, almost too cute to give to my destroyer Chesapeake's. But at the low price I got them for (I bought two), it was worth it. While this toy is far from indestructible...the neck is the weakest link...it did last longer than most. They actually didn't set out to destroy this toy...they carried them around, tossed them, pounced on them, occasionally chewed on them, but generally took good care of them. The Dino actually lasted two whole months! Which is very impressive! But once the neck cracked and a tiny bit of stuffing flew out that was the end! Next thing I know I have decapitated Dinos lying in a pile of stuffing. I could have sewed the end of the toy, but it was pretty much a gonner. I let them have a few extra days to finish off the body, and then Mom had to bury them in the garbage can.\r\nOverall, it was a fun, neat toy to have around...but if your dog is a destroyer just avoid stuffed toys altogether. No matter how tough they claim to be, they never live up to the status.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I do not read Showalter religiously but have picked up enough of her books over the years to be pretty familiar with her style and her evolving trends. For a while there, people were concerned that she had toned down the sex to the point that she was losing a big part of what constituted her stories. Well, friends, I don't know if this is the first book where the trend reverses, but the sex is here.\r\nI realize this is a bit like saying that you read Playboy for the articles - highly suspect - but I don't really care whether my romances have explicit sex in them or not. I generally skim or skip when the action gets too hot and heavy. (If I want erotica, I know where to find it.) I read Showalter because she manages somehow to go really super dark in her plots - hyper-violence! epic battles of good vs. evil! superbeings clashing over world-shattering stakes! - while still being really whimsical. Sometimes maybe a little on the verge of too much, maybe. The women in this book sounded to me like a Cosmo quorum. But it's still playful and breezy and good-spirited and leavens the darkness nicely. Fantasy-horror-rom-com.\r\nSometimes I have a problem with Showalter's world building. She's been at it so long and has built such an amazing canon that I'm constantly stumbling over plots and people I don't remember or just don't know, and I've run into a book or two where I felt sidelined by subplots or set-up for a future book. That wasn't an issue at all in Burning Dawn. There were references to the broader mythos and, yes, some groundwork, but it never distracted from the main story or left me confused.\r\nAnyhoodle, if you pant over alpha men and flippant women with a heart of gold, if your stomach doesn't churn when people are disemboweled or beheaded in fiction (or if you can push past it), if you can handle a story that is simultaneously grim and bouncy, AND if you do not shy at some pretty explicit shenanigans between (and above and nowhere near) the sheets, this could be the book for you.\r\nFun times. I recommend.","is_deceptive":false}

Their primary reason is for Playstation Now, but the controller can also be used for any of the other Android apps you load on the TV.\r\nIt has the Google Play store, and you're not limited to a handpicked selection from Sony.  I was able to load a Super Nintendo emulator onto this TV.  I was also able to put an app called Moonlight on here which allows me to stream my desktop PC games to this TV from across the house (needs Nvidia GPU).\r\nIt has Netflix, Amazon VOD, and Youtube built in, which is nice since I don't need to use my Roku anymore!  You can also download Plex, Kodi, or Hulu Plus from the Google Play Store.\r\nThis TV isn't perfect.  It does not come with 3D glasses and they are actually kind of hard to find and the Play Store was a little slow loading for me on occasion.\r\nI wish the price didn't jump from $798 up to $1299 for just 5\" more, but it's still a great value.  As long as you have read the reviews on here and are aware of some of the minor problems beforehand I think you will enjoy this TV a lot.","is_deceptive":false}

Getting it onto the basket and adjusted so the basket hangs level was a bit of a challenge and required some patience and perseverance, but the effort is well worthwhile.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"When it comes to Table Tennis Training Robots, iPong is known for the various products.\r\nOf course, the products can go anywhere from $40 to over a $100 but for those wanting a cheaper alternative may want to give the iPong Mini Ball holder a chance.\r\nFor its pricepoint, it's not going to hold over a 100 balls (it holds 20), no accessories or special spins, but still the iPong Mini Ball holder is great for its simple use and that is for people who want to train when it comes to aiming and targeting their shots.\r\nThe iPong Mini Ball Holder takes four AA batteries  - Note that the battery tray is held by a screw, takes 40mm (not 38mm) Ping Pong Balls and put 20 in there and turn the power on and you're ready to go.\r\nBalls are consistent and it's a lot of fun to play and use and see if you can land a ball on the top opening.\r\nAgain, this is great for simplicity but if you want more of a challenge, check out the iPong Topspin Table Tennis Training Robot which holds more balls (110), has more features (comes with a remote) and cost the same as the iPong Mini Ball Holder.  It's just that it's flourescent green and not as cool looking as this iPong Mini Ball Holder.\r\nNevertheless, it all comes down to you and your training.  If you want more challenge but more bang for under $40, then definitely go with the iPong Topspin Training Robot, as this iPong Mini Ball Holder may be too simplistic for its price and doesn't hold as many balls.  Personally, I feel that the iPong Mini Ball Holder, should have come with 20 balls and that would have made this holder a must-buy.\r\nBut on its own... 4\/5 stars","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Fosmon HD1832 Intelligent 5x1 5-Port HDMI Switcher is identical to a number of other no-brand generic HDMI switchers being offered on Amazon, with the important difference that it seems to be better finished and, most importantly, it includes a power supply adapter. There are a couple of other no-name switchers, that are otherwise identical, being sold without the power adapter. Obviously, having the power adapter is a plus. The unit is easy to set up and install, has the advantage of having the HDMI output on the opposite side as three of the HDMI inputs, and it has an IR remote sensor and a remote. I would worry more about the remote failing than the switch itself. So I would suggest making sure that you enter the remote commands in a learning remote if you have one, and use that remote instead of the supplied remote. In a pinch it has manual switching on the unit also. All easy to setup and has worked just fine for all kinds of HDMI devices plugged into it for display on my TV. RECOMMENDED.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"After using this back shaver for some time now I decided to give a great demonstration on how the shaver works.  The baKblade is definitely set apart from the other back shavers for multiple reason.  First, the baKblade has a larger blade that covers so much ground when shaving you are literally done in less than a minute.  The shave actually feels great and because of the way the shaving blades are arranged it's impossible to cut your back when using the shaver.  Also, there is no need for shaving cream when dry shaving as you can see from the video the shaver doesn't take much effort to actually get the job done either.  I have recommended this shaver to many friends and family and no one has every had a negative thing to say about it.  Also, the handle is very lightweight and has an ergonomic curve to it that allows the user to reach the \"hard to reach\" areas.  Another feature of this shaver that is a huge benefit is the fact that it actually tackles longer hairs too so if you are shaving your back for the first time there's no need to use a hair trimmer or electric trimmer to trim away first.  The blade surprisingly works under any circumstance. Take a look at my video and please vote \"yes\" if you feel this video was helpful to you.","is_deceptive":true}

Pros: * Look is very similar to the original (one more snap, same color) * Fit is a tiny bit tight, but it does go on OK * Length is perfect * The cushioning is nice; I don't feel the headphones' weight up there at all  Cons: * The material feels delicate, like it'll probably wear out faster than the original; time will tell * The underside material (what contacts the metal band) is not nearly as durable as the material in the original, which is quite tough. This may never become an issue, but given how the DT 770's adjustment never stays put, this could manifest in some internal tears.  Other thoughts: * For the price, a nice replacement headband.

In considering my options, I first opted for an LG sound bar to match the LG TV I would be pairing this with, but after reading the dismal reviews for available LG bars, I branched out for other options. I landed on this one purely by chance, clicked it because of the minimally intrusive design, and skipped right to Customer Reviews since manufacturers like to puff up their products (LG...).\r\nSo I started reading the reviews, and time after time for the first 40ish, everybody had generally positive things to say. Sure, there was the incomprehensible setup\/manual, but I figured \"I'm savvy enough I can figure it out.\" So I ordered it. Selected standard shipping. Expected to wait about a week and a half. Tick tock. I'm allowing myself to be excited by now.\r\nFOUR DAYS LATER, it's here! Oh boy oh boy oh boy! The box is long (about 4.5 feet) but somehow managed to arrive without any crushed corners or gashes. I drag it inside, set the whole package on the cocktail table in front of me and sit like a lonely, excited puppy and wait for my partner to get home. It's technically his, after all.\r\nHe walks in, sees the long new box and his face lights up just like mine did, maybe brighter because I somehow managed to keep it a secret. Tears into it, pulls everything out of the plastic bags and puts the feet on it. Sets it in front of the TV (it's a 46\" and it all but lines up perfectly with it). Stares at me because he's never used a TOSLink cable... Well, neither had I so I flipped thru the book as fast as I could and 4 pages later I'm at the end with no answers. Maddeningly unhelpful! I look at the cable and match the shapes on each end, one to the bar and one to the screen. It doesn't go in! Ohhh, don't forget to pop the plastic tips off your new TOSLink connectors before you try to plug them in.\r\nSo now we're all set up. It's connected to the TV, it's plugged in, it's ready to go. Power! Lights flashing! And...no sound. Hmm. Tap the remote on the table because that's the solve-all. Point it at the bar. Yep, it works, the lights are back. (They're white and blue, the two brightest LED colors, so they automatically turn off to mitigate glare.) I press Input on the bar's remote. Then again. And WHOA. Ear angels sing. TOSLink is Input 3, everybody. You'll need to know that, the book doesn't cover it.\r\nThe whole setup process from unpacking to ear ecstasy took less than half an hour with no instructions and just a touch of common sense. Totally painless.\r\nA week later we wanted to mount it on the wall. It's literally as easy as flipping the feet and hooking it on the screws you put in the wall 3 minutes before. Again, painless.\r\nA few notes. It should've had Bluetooth. Turn on and then leave on \"SRS.\" It's comparable to the effect of removing earplugs with the law mower running: the sound is SO MUCH clearer, brighter. Don't bother with \"TVol,\" it seems to muffle sound more than it levels output volumes. Some of the reviews say the remote has limited range; ours works wonderfully from 15 feet away and from the sideways end of the sectional. Mount it on the wall so it's high enough to catch your remote's suggestions. And be careful when lugging it around: during our recent move it collided with a wall on one end and the stainless plate (actually plastic) jumped off and one of the prongs on the plate snapped off inside of the hole in the body. Nothing a dab of Gorilla Glue can't fix and it's really a well-built item, just don't abuse it.\r\nAm I happy with this? Yes. I'm on here to buy two more. I absolutely recommend it, highly. It outperforms a high-end 5.1 system. It's less than $100. GET ONE!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"They taste good. But I'm not so sure about their quality control.\r\nIn the photo I've uploaded, you can see the size variation between some of the gummies. The larger one is the standard size, but there were quite a few like the stumpy one. I didn't count them, but the product is sold by units rather than weight, so presumably I got less. Not such a big deal I guess, but when you consider that we're only really going by their word as to what's inside the gummies, the lack of quality control on the size doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that the right amount of vitamins and minerals is going into the product.\r\nI've noticed issues with their other products too, where this is quite a variation between packages of the same product - some where the gummy is softer, others where it is harder. Some where there is a lot of sugar dusted on them, some where there is very little and they all stick together in a big glob.\r\nThat said, I continue to buy them because they taste good, they're easy to take, and it's better than nothing. I just wish I could have more confidence in their manufacturing.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've heard great things about these wrenches for a while and couldn't wait to get a set of my own. Unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed.  First, the blow mold case is exactly like the pic (which I guess makes sense) - there's no top, just what you see, which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever - I wouldn't take a star off for that.  I'm dropping stars because the sizing isn't right.  I've used the 10, 14, 17, and 18 so far.  The 18 is way off on the bolts I used it on (front suspension on my car).  The 5 deg. ratcheting does you no good if you've got 15 deg. of slop in the fit.  For the record, the bolt was an 18, and my other wrenches and sockets fit it perfectly.  The 10 was off as well, but not nearly as bad as the 18, and the others were close but still worse than most of my other tools.\r\nThe other reason I drop a star is because they're flimsy and skinny.  With an XL set like this you expect more heft.  When I'm really pulling on the wrench it feels like it's going to flip over or crumple or something.  There's plenty of strength in the direction you need, but the thinness in the other direction doesn't inspire me to really pull on them, which is the point of an XL wrench.\r\nThe good: They appear well made, nice finish, well marked, the ratcheting mechanism is crisp and solid.  The bad doesn't come out until you go to use it, and then it's just disappointing.","is_deceptive":false}

Very easy to adjust the cutting height, and is powerful enough for lawns.  Light and easy to move around. I have even cut deep wet grass. The blade was replaced when i hit a metal stake, but that was my error.  Most of my neighbors use these, because they are much quieter than smelly gas mowers.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Ernie Ball MVP is a great volume pedal. I am used to a Morley Little Alligator volume pedal, which is optical, not controlled by a volume pot. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. For instance, the string that controls the volume pot on the MVP will eventually fray and need to be replaced. Likewise, the pot itself may go bad over time \u2013 hopefully not during a live show!\r\nThe optical is certainly more reliable, but I\u2019ve noticed that the sweep on the Morley is not as smooth as the sweep on the MVP. There are advantages and disadvantages to this as well. For instance, the Morley is great for cello-like single note attacks. The MVP is far better (IMHO) for ambient swells. I use ambient swells in the church setting where I play, almost like giving the keyboard player a break when he\/she is covering more piano parts and we need the added pads.\r\nThe MVP, like the Morley, has a minimum knob which allows you to set a lower volume in the toe up position. Personally, I have never used this feature as I prefer to do swells from no volume to full volume. That being said, I can see where this feature would be very helpful before OR after your drives. Before the drives you could use it to adjust gain\/distortion levels \u2013 after the drives you could use it as an overall volume boost. The MVP also has the added feature of a decibel boost knob. This is great, especially in conjunction with the minimum knob, or by itself if you need the added gain. Personally, I don\u2019t use this feature as well but I can still see the added benefit.\r\nWhat is also nice about this pedal is the fact that it is buffered\/powered (9v). So, if you use the tuner out (as I do) you don\u2019t lose high end frequencies. In other words, it doesn\u2019t suck your tone.\r\nAll in all, this is a great volume pedal and I have it secure on my pedal board. I won\u2019t say that I\u2019m not apprehensive about the string eventually fraying and breaking, because I am. However,it is especially smooth and works most excellently for ambient volume swells. Definite five stars from me!","is_deceptive":false}

Plus I can get in on the lunacy too.\r\nThey're both hardcore, take no prisoners, aggressive chewers. These guys can saw through nylabones and Kongs like a beaver bussing through a 2 X 4. Few toys hold up very long with exception of the cotton rope. The rope is quite stiff because the weave is so tight. I know from experience this means the toy should hold up well.\r\nAfter hours of fierce tug - of war crazy time with me getting in on the fun there's hardly a single strand out of place.\r\nRope Toys Have Lot's of Benefits:\r\n* Cleans your dogs teeth and massages the gums\r\n* Provides a Great work out (for pooch AND owner)\r\n* Doubles as a chew toy and tug toy\r\n* Non Toxic - Cotton  even with some synthetic floss  can't obstruct the intestinal tract like rubber, Polymer and Bone.\r\n5 PAWS UP!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"What a wreak - literally. We have a shipwreck, a love affair on the rocks, people trying to run other's lives when they can't run their own. Ross in deep in debt with Warleggan liking nothing more than to crush him.  Julia is born and the apple of her parents eye. Verity Poldark & Andrew Blamey want forever and Francis say no.  Mark & Karen Daniels and Dr. Enys - oh my!  Affairs, Bitterness, christening, deceit, envy, folly, gambling,  hunger, illness, jealousy, kindness, lies, murder, oppression, parties, quarrels, revelry, snobs, violence. And in the end a beautiful moment of hope.\r\nTotally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters. I eagerly gobbled up the first 4 books\r\n1945 - Ross Poldark\r\n1946 - Demelza\r\n1950 - Jeremy Poldark\r\n1953 - Warleggan\r\nI stopped reading the series in 1977 as the novels had gotten so dark that I wasn't enjoying where the author was taking the characters.\r\n1973 - The Black Moon\r\n1976 - The Four Swans\r\n1977 - The Angry Tide\r\nI was poking in a book store on vacation and picked up `The Twisted Sword' and enjoyed it tremendously (with one exception - I didn't care for the outcome for Jeremy at all).\r\nIt was so good seeing Zacky Martin & Mrs. Zacky, Tholly Tregolis, Jud & Trudy Paynter - they hadn't changed at all. Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey.  And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character. And Cornwall, Nampara (the Ross Poldark home) Wheal Grace and Wheal Leisure all so familiar 40 years later.\r\n1981 - The Stranger from the Sea\r\n1982 - The Miller's Dance\r\n1984 - The Loving Cup\r\n1990 - The Twisted Sword\r\n2002 - Bella Poldark\r\nI am not sure I will pick up the last book as from the the reviews I don't think I will enjoy it as much.  The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 soit is truly the last written by him.\r\nFrom the publisher: Demelza, the miner's daughter that Poldark rescued from a fairground rabble, is now his wife. Demelza's efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry bring her confusion and heartache, despite the joy in the birth of their first child. Additionally the seeds of dispute with Warleggan are sown.\r\nAlso from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series  Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age.  An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I highly recommend this item. The price on this may have gone up some, I bought one some time ago. This is a VERY GOOD strap. One of the frequent problems with such items is that the metal is often a very low quality, planned obsolescence type of metal that I believe is called \"pot metal\", almost something like metal manufacturing leftover scrap materials, and the mechanism when a strap is made of that will tend to bend out of shape or break, or bend out of shape and then break when you bend it back.\r\nI bought this strap back more than a year and a half ago. I am kind of rough as far as loading a bag up a lot and was using the strap to often walk four miles a day to a bus plus sometimes hanging groceries off the bag on the way back. What I say then is not typical entirely typical use But the strap lasted and lasted and lasted in spite of my putting great strain on it. It lasted a lot longer than any strap I had ever had, perhaps about a year and a half or more, when straps usually gave out on me in, perhaps, two months. One day it broke. I had overpacked my bag and then had additional materials hanging from it.\r\nThis may sound silly, but I actually felt saddened, because I had been able to depend upon this strap like no other.\r\nThen the thought occurred to me to check on whether there was a guarantee. There was, and although I had to mail the strap in to them, they promptly, courteously, without question or grumbling fixed it.\r\nIf you are an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, you will not need this strap. But if you have to depend on a strap to carry a bit of weight and you need for it to last, I highly recommend this strap.\r\nAnd if you ARE an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, try to get the producer to supply you with this strap with the stipulation that you will be allowed to take it home.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"This is my first universal remote, so I can't compare it to others, but I'm amazed by how well it works. It has its quirks and it doesn't always do what it's supposed to do, but I happily take this over having multiple remotes. The Help feature on this remote is amazing and while others might consider it a nuisance to have to rely on it, I think it's a blessing. Setting up the remote was complicated at first, but I was able to figure it out after a few tries without reading up on it, though there are still a few functions I'm still not clear on. Logitech customer service is also great. The only device I've tried that this device isn't compatible with is the Amazon Fire TV. You'll need a hub-based remote for that functionality. The learn function also works well. The remote itself is fairly lightweight and feels comfortable. Keep in mind that you have to sync the remote after any change you make to the settings, and syncing isn't wireless. The included usb cable is required. It only gets tiresome if you're constantly changing the settings or configuration of your home entertainment setup.  Edit 9\/20\/15: Unfortunately, I have to change my good review. After a few months, this remote has become increasingly frustrating. It was at the point where I couldn't do anything at all without the help button. It wouldn't switch to the correct devices. It even stopped turning on my TV. I finally spoke with a tech support person who spent a lot of time fixing the issue. It's now better, but still has its glitches. I wouldn't recommend.","is_deceptive":false}

I cook a lot of foods with marinades and need to scrape off the burnt on crusts every time I am finished.  This brush did an OK job.  The brass bristles, which are recommended for cast iron, felt a bit too soft to scrub it well enough.  There is no scraper on this so it was more difficult for the big burnt on pieces.\r\nI used water and set all my burners on high for 15 minutes to get the grill to 700 degrees, but it could not get all the debris off.  This is my first time using a brush this style.  I normally use a brush with a scraper.\r\nI do like that the handle is long because once the water touches a hot grill, the steam is very hot.  It has a nice thick handle but did not perform like I would have liked.\r\nIt is an OK brush.  I will go back to using my usual style brush.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A child's eye view of the desperate and ruinous destruction wrought by that satanic game called WWll. Nineteen forty-five marked the nadir of human civilization, to quote Gunter Grass who served in a branch of the SS during the dark world war. I suggest that one read Samuel's work after having digested Solzhenitsyn's \" Prussian Nights: A Poem (1977)\" and M. Hillers's \"A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City (2000),\" possibly in the reverse order. Samuel says (p. 346) \"... the dirt of our lives was not only under our fingernails and our unwashed bodies but had penetrated our souls.\" Solzhenitsyn and Hillers in their respective books or rather in their litanies describe in detail when and how human beings turn into inhuman beasts in the midst of the bloody calvary. The only hitch in Samuel's book is that Wolfgang appears to too ably digest the many incomprehensible and complex war situations that even the grown-ups wouldn't be able to comprehend. In part of the story, often times Wolfgang's child's eye view inadvertently gets transformed into a grown-up's eye view.","is_deceptive":false}

I really wish there was a narrow calf option with an 11 or 12 inch circum. so that I could get a more fitted look.\r\nI highly recommend these boots! I can't wait to wear them!

{"text":"Like several other reviewers I'd been using SM58's until trying these out and was blown away. We use these for vocals in both a rehearsal studio environment and live performance. They run thru dbx 286A preamp\/compressor\/gates in normal use but when we got the first one I a\/b tested it against the Shure straight into the console as well. Here's my rundown:  * sonically they have wider response, just a little bit more at the bottom and noticeably more extension at the top. To my ears it's slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off.  * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58's. On the other hand, our singers have to remember to sing more directly into the mic. Minimal proximity effect as well. Plosives are well controlled, about the same as the Shure.  * sturdy construction, minimal handling noise, good weight balance, feels slightly heavier than the 58.  * first reaction when the band saw them was \"ooo sexy\". I dunno about sexy but it IS a nice looking mic.  Overall these are a nice improvement. I have now replaced my 58's with e835's and could hardly be happier with the results. Microphone qualities are highly subjective so listen to both back to back if at all possible, and decide for yourself! The e835 may not be right for you but in my case have exceeded expectations.","is_deceptive":false}

So you need to be home at the end of the cooking time.\r\nI have used this for one recipe so far, and the chicken was done just right.  So I think the temperature must be about the same as other slow cookers.\r\nThe controls are quite simple.

I really like how this deflector is saving me on energy costs because now the house is able to cool down or heat up at lower temperatures.

{"text":"Even though Belkin did a great job with a super thin and wide spaced keyboard with a Surface style stand, there is still scope of improvement in this product.\r\nStyle and Design: Very elegant and classy looks. Well designed with all ports and connections easily accessible.\r\nWeight : 17.2 oz (1.075 lbs) slightly heavier than the iPad Air itself.\r\nKeyboard: Very thin and keys are designed to type faster. Some keys are oddly placed like \"\/\" has to be used with shift, \":\" is next to the space bar, and back arrow is placed close to pair button. I guess this will take some time to get used to.\r\nSmart function: Entirely missing. It does not automatically sleeps and wake your iPad. You have to do it manually.\r\nIPad Enlsosure: The interior side to hold iPad is a bit flimsy and not good quality as expected from the overall product. Its held by mere elastic bands.\r\nExterior Surface: Good looks, can be wiped clean easily.\r\nPositions: Three standing positions in horizontal orientation. The keyboard cover can be fully folded into the back for reading in vertical orientation. However, it is a bit convenient due to more than twice the weight from iPad Air itself and hence not suited for long time reading.\r\nOverall, it is a good companion for typing and writing and may provide good value for money at about 50 bucks.","is_deceptive":false}

But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies\/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins\/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!!

{"text":"Science X Crystals and Gemstones Activity Kit\r\n(Ravensburger, 2013)\r\n. . .\r\nA nice simple, budget-line science kit for kids interested in gems, crystals and minerology. Among the twenty experiments detailed in the instructions are a couple of crystal-growing projects, which are always fun. Perhaps the best of these is one where you grow your own \"geode\" inside an artificial plaster shell, although you will want to take you time and be sure to cast the plaster with care - it's not the most durable material. This kit stands out for the variety and breadth of experiments it offers -- it's not just another crystal-growing set, but also includes numerous gem and mineral samples and various ways of testing their composition, strength and density. The wide scope of the set is its strong point, while it loses points for the stinginess of the materials included... The samples are small, the materials not always the best. Kids who are already into rocks and science in general might be able to make better use of the activity book is they provide their own materials, particularly if they already have a stronger, higher quality magnifying glass than the one Ravensberger provides. All in all, though, this is a nice kit with some real science and decent experiments -- worth checking out!","is_deceptive":false}

It is the circular screw variety that slips between bars. I've had other foraging toys that use a similar clip, but this one \"skips\" teeth if it is tightened too much causing it to actually get more loose.

My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is \"real.\"  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all \"out there.\"  No, actually he brings you \"in there,\" into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.  Although I started the journey in to his mind and heart, I found myself walking a different path, my path, my past, my life, my heart, my soul, my failures, my fears, my shortcomings, my questions, deep personal and spiritual questions. At one point I stopped, closed the book, meditated about what I have just read and wondered, \"How could someone so \"young\" have so much insight, wisdom and thoughts that are supposed to occur when you are my age!?  Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no \"preachy\" words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.

They weren't bad, but they weren't what they claim either.\r\nThey didn't taste like \"Birthday Cake.\" When I think of birthday cake I think of a chocolate or vanilla cake with thick whipped frosting and sugar sprinkles. I expect a vanilla and cream or chocolate and cream taste. However, all I got was the chocolate. They did taste like chocolate cake, I will give them that, but not like a chocolate birthday cake. They are larger than other MMs, and I'm not sure why. I really hope that MMs continues that flavor next year, but that they call it something more suitable like Chocolate Cake, Cake, or Brownie flavor instead.\r\nPositives\r\n-Larger Than  Normal\r\n-Chocolate Cake Taste\r\nNegatives\r\n-No Frosting Taste\r\n-Go Stale Faster Than Others (learned the hard way)\r\nI would suggest that you only purchase these if you simply want a large or more chocolate MM not a birthday cake flavored one.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"There may be spoilers.\r\nI feel a little guilty giving this movie two stars.  In actuality it is one of the worst, dumbest movies ever made.  However, I think that is much of the point of these offbeat movies made for the SyFy Network.  You could easily make an argument that for investment purposes, this may be one of the best movies ever.  Made for $1 million, it's a big hit.  So here's the deal.\r\nFin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former surfing champ who now owns a bar on the beach near L. A.  As a hurricane brews off the Mexican coast, strong winds move up the California shoreline.  Water spouts begin to appear at the same time as a large school of sharks.  Before you know it, the large water spouts pick up the sharks and start depositing them inland.  At the same time the tropical storm is flooding everything.  This give the re-deposited sharks access to the storm drains as well as an occasional swimming pool.\r\nFin along with an Australian surfing buddy Baz (Jaason Simmons), George (John Heard), the local drunk and a hot employee named Nova (Cassie Scerbo) head for the hills (literally) to look in on Fin's ex-wife, April (a stone faced Tara Reid), his teenage daughter, Claudia (Aubrey Peeples) and college aged son, Matt (Chuck Hittinger).  Well Matt's away at flight school or something, April and Claudia insist they don't need help.  That is until a flying shark eats April's new boyfriend.\r\nSo most of the movie has sharks appearing from everywhere eating everything and everyone in their path.  Fin and company concoct a plan to have flyboy Matt and Nova take a helicopter up into the now 3 tornados and toss in an improvised bomb which will defuse the tornado and kill the sharks contained therein.  And guess what?  It works.  One casualty is Nova when she is taken off guard and swallowed by a flying great white shark.\r\nAlthough for most of the movie, I thought Nova was going to be Fin's girlfriend, it turns out she's better suited for son Matt.  That way Fin can reunite with April.  But wait, Nova was swallowed by the great white.  No matter.  Fin armed with a chain saw, manages to find the same fish and dive in head first, cutting his way out from the inside and saving Nova for Matt.  I have to admit to laughing out loud for much of the film.  I was especially caught up in several lines uttered that came verbatim from \"Jaws.\"  Like I said, this may be the worst or best movie ever.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A book spawned with deep intellect and even deeper philosophical meaning comes Yuehai Xiao's Crossing the Seas: A Diary of My Thoughts is a book of sheer empowerment to humankind. This book is written in diary format, which for one I love. It made it so easy to read and to absorb. I feel absorbance is the purpose. When we absorb things we become forced to think about them. Thought is a power motivator in life. People in this world are no longer free thinkers. We watch exactly what is put in front of us, and we accept it as gospel.\r\nWhen you read this book you know acceptance is not option. Xiao's has obviously taken much time and put much thought into this book. We as people have to learn to upgrade our thought process. I for one am an academic. I can test with the best and score high. I have excellent memorization skills. But it goes no further than that. Yes I am memorizing but I have never learned to absorb it. I am 37 years old. And it's truly sad. When it comes to my life I am testing at a D level at best.\r\nIf we continue on this path of learning and not absorbing we are a doomed species. I think this book it gets to the heart of it all. So our youth can grow, learn and absorb. It has always been about how much you can learn and how fast. It needs to be about what you learn and what you can absorb, and use to help humanity. I believe that this book is trying to help us a people open our minds wider so we can absorb more. It's definitely a book that will leave you with a lot to think about in the end.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I am a nature photographer as a hobby to all the hiking I do & I had been wanting a Digital SLR Nikon forever but could never afford to spend that much on a camera, then finally Nikon made a Coolpix L820 model that looks like an SLR, but the lens is fixed to the camera body & the lens also doesn't allow for a filter of any kind, so if your lens gets scratched, it is ruined.\r\nSo this Metal Lens filter adapter tube allows you to be able to put a polarizer & lens cap, which is exactly what I wanted to do.  This filter adapter tube has tiny pegs which tighten down on the outer part of the lens housing on the camera with simple allen wrenches that is included with the adapter.  The lens adapter ring is metal & durable but it does not mount that tightly to the camera lens, it only connects in 2 points on the sides. I think that if it connected in 4 places that it wouldn't move up & down if you touch it.  I was just not that comfortable cranking down on my new camera with some metal pegs to attach this thing.\r\nThe adapter ring screws off\/on in the middle, so it can be used as a zoom lens tube or widescreen lens tube.  I do love that someone made a 'fix' for Nikons inability to make a threaded end to the lens to affix a polarizing filter, but this gadget is limited to the makings of Nikon and the lens tube will be in the actual shot (photo) if you take a widescreen (zoomed out) shot with the telephoto adapter attachment on the lens.\r\nWhen you have the widescreen (half adapter) attached to the lens, if you zoom out too much, the lens will hit the end of the filter & read an error.  When this happens, all you have to do is turn the camera off & back on.  You just have to get a feel of how to use this & the limitations.  I actually lost the telephoto half of the ring & now have only the widescreen tube, but both tubes equally work with a filter & lens cap of any type (62mm) & I find that this is all I need anyway & that when I zoom into a shot, the lighting is at dusk or dawn or shadows (animals in the wilderness), so the camera actually takes a nice shot without the polarizer on it.\r\nSo, Yes I am happy to be able to use a polarizer on my new Nikon Coolpix SLR fixed lens, but the constant screwing & unscrewing from telephoto to widescreen was annoying, so I usually only shoot wide, or I take off the filter, leaving the tube on it, then the lens will zoom right through the tube with no problems, so you never have to take it off, just the filter you add.\r\nThis is more of a situation problem than any problem with this product, except for the way it moves up & down if you bump it with your hand, but it is not a deal breaker.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I originally bought this scope from Wayfair on amazon, and after the placing the order, it was brought to my attention that Wayfair was selling the Gen 2 model rather than the Gen 2+. Over email, I let them know that I was not interested in the Gen 2 model and did not wish to continue with the order. In the meantime, the product had already shipped, and the charge to my card was processed. Long story short, Wayfair was definitely WAY FAIR about it! They got the product back before it got to me and promptly refunded the money. This easily could have turned into a hassle with a significant chunk of change, but it didnt. I would definitely consider doing business with Wayfair again.\r\nNow, on to the product review. I ended up getting the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w\/6x Magnification, as advertised, from optics planet. This scope is phenomenal!!! I have a lower end Gen 1 monocular, and compared to that, the difference is literally night and day. I set up with it the other night, with about 25% of the moon lit up, and watched some coyotes about 400 yards away. I could nearly count their teeth!!! The only downside to this scope is that I can see farther than I feel confident shooting with the gun I have it mounted on.\r\nBefore the moon comes out, when its pitch black, it still provides a decent picture. With the IR spotlight that comes with it, you can see about 100 yards with no other light, as long as youre not getting a reflection from nearby objects.\r\nAll in all, the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w\/6x Magnification is worth it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm relatively new to playing drums, but I listen critically to every instrument related to drumming -- I'm an audio engineer, primarily.\r\nI started out with a set of Zildjian K Custom Hybrid 13 1\/4\" hi-hats.  These hats had a very bright, aggressive \"chick\" sound, but to get any sort of tightness out of them, you'd have to practically stand on the pedal.  For more open-hat playing styles, they were great, but that's not what I was looking for.  I wanted a more versatile set of hats.  After listening to, and playing, a number of hi-hats by Zildjian, Paiste, and Meinl, I was starting to wonder if I'd ever find the hats I wanted.\r\nI saw a used pair of Paiste Dark Crisp 13\" hats on display at a store in their cymbal room.  Since they were set up on a hat stand already, I gave 'em a chick.  My eyes widened.  I started working them with sticks, all the way from full closed to wide open.  AMAZING!  Brightly crisp on the top, but with a low pitch.  I immediately asked if I could put these hats on a kit, next to what was previously my front runner choice: Zildjian A Custom 14\" hats.  I played both sets of hats, and the 13\" Dark Crisp hats won handily.  I hadn't intended to buy hats that day, but I snapped them up.\r\nA professional drummer friend of mine had great hats -- Zildjian K custom bottom, and A custom top, 13\".  He loved them, but after 12 years of hard playing, they finally cracked.  He asked to borrow mine for a show he was playing, despite being a staunch Zildjian fan -- now he wants a set of his own.\r\nBottom line:  These hats are crisp, they cut through the mix, and they're incredibly responsive to the way you play them.  They also sound great recorded!  This is a sound that I could see working for most genres of music.  They're probably not appropriate for very loud, hard playing, but they're absolutely appropriate for anything played at moderate levels where finesse and tone take precedence over volume.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.\r\nFit Deck\r\nFit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.\r\nAbout $16\/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.\r\nStrength Stack 52\r\nIn my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.\r\nThe best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.\r\nAbout $16\/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.\r\nWorkout Labs\r\nThis is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.\r\nThe cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.\r\nI hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.","is_deceptive":true}

I also love the little kickstand, even though I didn't get this case for that reason. I use it when I am reading on the phone in a coffee shop or when I am teaching a class I have it up with the time displaying so I can keep track. It is easy to take on and off if needed as well. My biggest complaint is that it makes the phone so big that I can't put it in my pocket (I am petite). That would probably be an issue with any similar case.

This work perfectly had to start my car no problems I jump the vehicles 5 times using it in consecutively,every time it done with no hesitation, and the unit still had 4 lights of battery level left.That is slightly batter than advertised.  In addition to jump start the car, it still has a few bonuses like the USB port and flash light.

Since there are 100 caps, this will last me a long time. The plastic is thin, but not fragile or delicate, and the band on the edge gives it a good grip around my head. I have not had any troubles with these caps so far. I also deep condition my hair and these are obviously great for that.

{"text":"I bought this stainless steel grate to use  with my 22 1\/2 inch-diameter Masterbuilt kettle grill. The grate is 21 1\/2 inches in diameter and is designed for use in 22 1\/2 inch-diameter Weber kettle grills. The grate is manufactured out of sturdy, thick-gauge steel. The quality of the construction is evident; the grate is made in Taiwan. If you have owned cooking grates in the past that were made out of thin-gauged, flimsy steel which sagged under the weight of heavy foods such as brisket or large steaks, rest assured, sagging simply won't happen with this grate -- the thick-gauge steel bars and the circular insert in the middle of the grate allow for increased structural support as compared with the steel bars of flimsier grates.    The feature which increases the utility of this grate as compared with standard cooking grates are the  two hinged sections on the left and right sides of the grate, which allow the grate to flip upwards so that one can add additional charcoal or smoking chips\/chunks, as needed. In addition, the center of the grate features a circular section approximately 12 inches in diameter, which is entirely removable, and, which can be removed to add charcoal and\/or smoking woods, or, replaced with one of Weber's modular replacement sections, such as a griddle or a cast iron searing plate. Cleaning the grate is as easy as using hot water, dish soap and a steel wool scouring pad to scrape away fats and grease. The steel will acquire a patina over time from smoke and oil, but, that is to be expected, and, it doesn't affect performance in any way. This is a quality product which will last a long time.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"It is a rare thing to be able to buy an entire run of novella. So many of us have to settle for shortened versions. If you want an opinion of the story you found one. If you want to read me complain that this DVD shortens it, well that was it.  Lucia is a dreamer. One day she meets the man of her dreams, Jose Simon but he doesn't have eyes for her. She's poor and he's one of the wealthiest men in Peru. While working at a flower shop she meets Roberto, whom she believes is also poor. She initially doesn't like him but soon they become friends. What Lucia does not know is that he is actually Jose Simon's brother and also wealthy. In a series of misunderstandings Lucia re-meets Jose Simon, but this time as an Italian countess. He immediately falls for her, or is it for her money? Now Lucia must decide if she loves the wealthy Jose Simon or the poor Roberto?  This novella ranks up in my top 3 of all time. While you don't get to see the entire series they do a decent job of showing you how things transpire. If you are debating getting this after never seeing I recommend you go for it. If you were a fan of the original run, well be ready to see it shortened.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Swordfish has in my opinion one of the best openings to a movie I have ever seen. The writing here is so superb, I think it should have been worthy of an Oscar nomination for John Travolta just for this scene alone. It introduces the character of Gabriel played by Travolta. At first you don't really know what is going on just that Gabriel is here starting to talk about Hollywood movies. As the dialogue progresses you begin to hear Gabriel discussing his distaste for movies lack of realism. He then moves into discussing the movie Dog Day Afternoon. And what would happen if Pacino really wanted to get away with the money he stole from the bank in the movie. Gabriel talks about what if Pacino started killing hostages left and right. How long would it take for the city to reverse is policies on hostage negotiation. It is then revealed that Gabriel has taken hostages and is in the middle of a bank heist of his own. Not to give too much more away for people who haven't seen Swordfish but the beginning ends with an amazing explosion that will rock your home theater system into overdrive along with some amazing visual photography.  The character of Gabriel is my favorite Travolta performance of all-time. He plays a character who is always many steps ahead of everyone else in the entire movie. Until the ending you never really know who Gabriel really is, only that he is a bad guy. And he's a bad guy you really like. You are always left guessing at what the motive is behind all of his actions, but he goes on to talk much about misdirection. Throughout the entire movie this is always a reoccurring theme to keep you guessing at what happens next.  The rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. Hugh Jackman plays the part of Stanley Jobson who is an computer hacker who no longer is allowed anywhere near a computer and is living in a trailer working a dead-end job. Halle Berry plays the roll of Ginger, who like Gabriel, as the movie goes on you never are too sure of who she really is. All that you are lead to know is that she is with Gabriel and her job is to bring Stanley in because Gabriel wants his computer skills for a job he needs done. Don Cheadle plays the role of J.T. Roberts who worked for the FBI and was the man who arrested Stanley and is the reason he is no longer allowed near a computer. Also following Stanley's arrest, Stanley lost custody of his daughter thanks to Roberts. Roberts now is now on the trail of Gabriel and the one trying to put together what Gabriel needs Stanley to do for him. Lastly, Sam Shepard plays the roll of Senator Reisman. I won't go too deep into what his roll is in the movie as it might give too much away to those who haven't seen it. Just know he plays a very important role.  I will say that action movies are by far my favorite type of movie and this movie is a perfect example of why. This movie features everything you will look for in an action movie; guns, car chases (with a beatuiful TVR Tuscan I might add), explosions, beautiful women, and even a bus dangling from a helicopter while flying through L.A. The movie also has a visual look to it that I can't put quite into words. It has some type of yellowish lens filter on some scenes and a cool blueish, purplish, greenish filter on other scenes. You really have to see it, it just gives the movie its own feeling that I have never seen before and I absolutely love it. And I never want another movie to use it because looking at it just reminds me this is Swordfish.  The other thing I must bring up is this films AMAZING soundtrack . It was created by popular techno artist Paul Oakenfold. I have never heard a soundtrack like this in my life. It just fits the entire look of the movie so amazingly and will also give your home theater system a workout as well.  Finally I will talk about the Blu-Ray itself. The picture quality here is reference quality. Its that good. It also features a 5.1 Dolby Digital track which is a bit older than today's current DTS HD tracks but it still sounds very phenomenal.  Just sit back and log on, hack in, go anywhere, and steal everything with Swordfish.","is_deceptive":false}

But so far (and I'm not QUITE finished with it), it's kind of a trudge.  Lot of similar mission types, lot of very loose driving, and a lot of very loose combat.  Loose is a generally good term for the game overall.\r\nSince it seems like this'll probably get a sequel one way or another, I'm hoping they can take all the cool fun things out of this one (THE HACKING) and polish them into something really good the next time around.

{"text":"The Infant Optics baby monitor is simply the best one that we have used yet.  We replaced our original $200 Summer color video monitor with the Infant Optics monitor, after briefly trying out the $150 Motorola monitor, and there are several key improvements we noticed over the others we've tried:\r\n1. The image clarity is excellent using the standard lens, in both day and night mode.\r\n2. The sound quality when talking to your child is impressive - it sounds very realistic, even when singing lullabies to our toddler!\r\n3. The screen is large, and the interface is easy to use.  I enjoy the kick-stand as well.\r\n4. The temperature monitor is very helpful to have, and seems accurate.\r\nMy only bones to pick with the product are:\r\n1.  If you lay the monitor down without the kickstand, the sound is reduced because the speaker is covered.\r\n2.  I wish that Infant Optics also manufactured a silicon case for the monitor - I firmly believe in having a case for all my electronic devices, no matter how well made.\r\nI love this product, and recommend it to anyone looking for a great baby monitor with 2-way voice, day\/night picture mode, a thermometer, and a great lens.  It is a cut above any monitor we have tried previously.","is_deceptive":false}

But I do it.\r\nThe watch is an incredible value at about $25, and I just bought my third one. Why so many?  The plastic band gets brittle and breaks after 2 to 3 years.

I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.  We had a wind up mobile before purchasing this one and hated it. THIS one  http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKZMXr We just put batteries in it last night, and I am in love with it!!

I like having this set with the building base and carrying case.  We have two sets and added the connector set as well. You can also buy more complicated sets of instruction cards.  I love watching my preschool aged kids figure out new ways to turn and stack them and build new creations.  You can follow the direction cards included or freestyle.  They are a playdate favorite!  My tween and teen nephews and niece love them as well and always try to build lifesize towers.  Buy them!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Kenneth Cole Reaction is an outstanding computer bag, a vast improvement over any I've had before (Targus, etc). The quality manufacture is obvious at once in terms of the stitching, zippers, and the other materials, and it is very well padded.\r\nThe bag easily holds everything I need with me, including my Kindle, my Samsung Galaxy Tablet (in a special sleeve), a slender paperback book, pens, micro-recorder, etc. I could easily add my smart phone to the mix if necessary, though I generally carry that on my person.\r\nI hauled this bag along with me the other day and it fit very comfortably on my back. Best of all, when I set it down, it sat upright without threat of falling over, making it easy to retrieve the contents, unlike my old messenger-style bag which had to be laid on its side when not in use.\r\nI used to live in fear of my computer being damaged because of the flimsy nature of my bag, making me reluctant to haul it around, but no longer.\r\nSome of its advertised features (and my comments):\r\n*1680d Nylon\r\n*Expansion Feature For Added Carrying Capacity. Easy Access Zipper Pocket And Soft Lined Zipper Pocket To Hold Digital Media Or Other Valuables. Front Zip Down Pocket Includes An Extensive Organizer That Will Hold A Variety Of Business Essentials.\r\n*Designed With Checkpoint Friendly\/EZ-Scan Feature Which Complies With TSA Guidelines So Your Laptop Does Not Need To Be Removed When Passing Through Airport Security Checkpoints, Allowing You To Get On Your Way Faster. I don't travel often but I can see where this would be an incredibly useful feature.\r\n*Front Compartment Contains A Padded iPad\/Tablet Pocket, A Full Length Open Top Pocket, And A Zippered Mesh Pocket. This is a great feature. I could not have safely put my tablet into my old bag, let alone a Kindle on top of that. Now I can carry both with me safely.\r\n*EZ-Scan Section Includes Three Zippered Organizer Pockets. Rear Compartment Is Padded To Hold Most Laptops With Up To A 15.6 inch Screen . High Tech Double Density Foam Padding For Extra Laptop Protection.\r\n*Side Exterior Features A Zipper Pocket And A Mesh Open Top Beverage Holster. Padded Top Handle And Air Mesh Back Panel That Will Attach To Most Luggage Upright Handles For Hands Free Carrying. You have to love a beverage holster. The top handle is very comfortable.\r\n*Ergonomic Adjustable Backpack Straps With Sternum Strap. As I said, this is very comfortable and the sternum strap is great. I could carry this thing for a long time without experiencing discomfort. The weight is very well distributed.\r\nYes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for with this bag. I would have hesitated spending this much on a bag sight unseen but if you don't trust my review, find one of these in a store and look at it, Pick it up, examine it. You will be won over.","is_deceptive":false}

It has room for my iPad, but I haven't used the bag for that.\r\nThere are plenty of compartments for someone who likes to be organized. The bonus is the warranty, my laptop won't even make it that long.\r\nThis is a solid product!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"this was my second carabiner travel cup from this maker that I bought (first got lost). The first one had a wobbly base if you set it on the counter. It still functioned but I didn't use it very long before it was lost. Got another one so I could take it with me on a medical mission trip to Africa. There are many travel mugs available on the market today, but I bought this kind specifically for the carabiner handle. The handle definitely was convenient while I was in Africa because when I finished drinking my coffee at work, I could simply clip the cup to my bag and not have to carry it or worry about something leaking out into the bag while I was walking home. My frustrations with it are again because of the base. This time it's not wobbly, but there must be small holes or fractures in the frame. When it was delivered I put it in the sink full of water to wash it. I took it out and there was water stuck inside the walls of the cup. I had to let it sit for over a day to slowly drain out. I'm sure there will be rust in there over time so I will probably not use it on my next Africa trip. The cup is a great concept but uses poor design and materials. Wish it was different because I love having the clip but hate the base problems. The lid had a tight seal but the part you slide open to reveal the drinking hole also came undone sometimes.","is_deceptive":false}

Once I installed it, I called a friend just to see if it works ( prior to that I had to activate product through their website, which was an annoying process). However, friend told me that he couldn't hear me well and that he noticed a repeat of every word I say. I didn't knew what happened, since I updated software online to the newest version, so we changed places and I got onto his phone and he on Ooma. I noticed the same thing, low volume and slight delay, which really ruined the whole experience. At last I returned the item and made a fair exchange...\r\nI got myself a new Telo Home Service ( http:\/\/amzn.to\/1vBqHZ5 ), which wasn't malfunctioned.

{"text":"Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1\", and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13\" cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts","is_deceptive":false}

They are both a little darker than the photos but none the less vibrant and awesome to look at. Aesthetics aside, I did a lot of research before I ordered these mats, and in terms of price and quality Aurorae is definitely giant strides ahead of most others in the mat manufacturing business. We've owned mats before that were more expensive than these and lasted quite awhile, but were nowhere near as comfortable and well made. I highly recommend giving your mats a good bath before you use them. You're not supposed to use oil based detergents but we'd run out of Dr B's non oil-based castile soap and just used the lavender oil-based one which worked fine, (not surprising since it's such an awesome soap) then set the mats out to dry in the sun. I've come to find that no matter how you wash your mat, this step is very important. The sun further removes the resin that's been applied before shipping. Bottom line? This mat is thicker, longer, more durable, and made with better material than most other mats you'll find for this price. As an added bonus, the designs are really cool and the customer service is prompt and personable. You can't go wrong with one of these beautiful mats.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm seriously into the wonderful qualities of Essential Oils, and I'm searching for diffusers to run pretty much full time throughout my house. First of all, I put filtered water into the two MUI Color 600ML diffusers I ordered. The instructions say to use tap water, but I don't even drink straight tap water, and I don't like the thought of diffusing chlorine, fluoride, etc. They shut off after about 5 minutes. So, I had to use tap water. I also don't like that the water to EO ratio is so high. By that I mean, the instructions call for 2 drops of oil in a full tank of water. I can hardly smell the oils I'm trying to permeate the house with for both the beautiful aromas as well as the healing powers. On the plus side, they run a long time, and they're sort of interesting looking. I wanted to put them on 24 hour timers, like 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off, but they don't work on timers because once they shut off, they turn back on only when the button is pushed. I contacted the seller about returning them, but since they actually run, I'd have to pay shipping, so I kept them. They're more of a humidifier than an oil diffuser, so I'll probably use them in winter.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It lacks content. This game, while fun, is just not worth full price.\r\nI hated my:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00KME8K9C\r\nNo fanboy can deny that. Single player starts off ok before devolving into a check the block COD knock off. The arrest mechanic, while fun at first, gets repetitive since bad guys react the same way every time. AI is just awful. But hey, who plays battlefield for single player, right? Hotwire and heist multiplayer modes are great. Conquest mode is neutered without attack helicopters and tanks. Sure it's a cops and robbers game, but if you are going to throw in a classic mode than Visceral\/DICE shouldn't have been so lazy about it. They could have themed it to allow for the fun stuff. After all, they have tanks and attack choppers in the campaign. The few 5v5 modes are not worth your time as Counter-strike does them better. There are a few balancing issues and bugs that need to be ironed out, but overall it runs well. There is hardly any destruction outside of levolution events, which kind of makes sense so that people may use the grappling hook and a few other gadgets, but it's still a disappointment none the less. My biggest gripe is the overall lack of content. EA promised us that Hardline would have the same amount of content as BF4. That was a lie. You only get a few guns per class. Take the enforcer class for example, you get to choose between 2 shotguns or 2 medium range rifles. If you don't like any of those then you are sh$% out of luck. Same thing goes for pistols and for some reason they are locked to certain classes. Why can't I carry a Beretta or glock in the mechanic class? It seems to me like they stripped a lot of content to later sell as DLC, which is what this game should have been... themed DLC. While I cannot recommend at full price, I do recommend it if you can get it for $30 or less. Or just skip it all together since BF4 is running great and better titles are coming out this year. At full price - 2.5\/5 stars.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I must admit that I approached this dvd with a fair degree of scrutiny, due to the fact that it was one of those \"UNAUTHORIZED\" releases. I must say, however, both my friend & myself were very pleased with this recent release. Due to the fact that it was unauthorized, I had to look very closely at exactly who was involved in the making of this dvd. With some rare footage of recordings, some performance footage, and talking heads mainly with key participants that included rock journalist Robert Christgau, producer John Simon, & musicians Garth Hudson, Mickey Jones, & Charlie Mccoy, this documentary is very informative & enjoyable. Essentially beginning with some very early footage of The Hawks, who would later become The Band, & Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 performing his hits \"Mary Lou\" & Forty Days, the dvd moves forward capturing all of the important events that charted Dylans' progression with The Band between 1965-1976. Both fans of Dylan, as well as of The Band, will thoroughly enjoy this dvd. The Hawks attracted Dylan's attention while both were playing in Greenwich Village. Both drummer\/vocalist Levon Helm & guitarist Robbie Robertson were in the electrified backup group at Dylan's controversial Forest Hills, New York concert of August 28, 1965. Despite a falling out between Dylan and Helm, Dylan then hired The Hawks-with drummerdylan's Mickey Jones in place of Helm-for his controversial 1965-66 world tour. This became the beginnings of a longtime collaboration for both parties . After Dylan's July 29, 1966 famous motorcycle accident, the group settled near the suddenly reclusive Dylan in the Woodstock, New York, area. Shortly thereafter Helm rejoined & they began to record what would evolve into \"The Basement Tapes\". The Band also began to record their own material as well. Most of this new material was written by Roberson and Richard Manuel in a basement studio in the group's house, known as \"Big Pink\". This evolved into Music From Big Pink by The Band. The Band's 2nd LP was simply titled \"The Band\",& Christgau & Simon stressed the importance of the LP as the beginning of what would be known as \"Americana\" music. The dvd then carefully charts the startling new direction that Dylan's music took. Evolving into John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, New Morning, & Planet Waves, which was recorded with The Band. The commentary by the soft-spoken Garth Hudson, who was the Band's organ player, is very interesting. Mickey Jones, the drummer for the infamous tour, spoke of how the crowds would only boo louder as the tour progressed. This only drove Dylan & The Band to play louder, which would only infuriate crowds even more. There is footage from other sources, such as Eat The Document, Don't Look Back, & even Monterey Pop. But there is a substantial amount of footage of the tour, as well as some sessions never seen before, to satisfy both fans of Dylan, as well as the Band. The dvd also emphasizes the idea of how both Dylan & The Band influenced & toured with each other, especially in 1974. The dvd also strongly stresses the importance of this new \"Americana\" music which The Band introduced even more strongly with their 2nd LP. There is even time given to the importance of the very 1st bootleg LP \"Great White Wonder\". All in all, fans of Dylan and\/or the Band, will find the dvd a welcome delight. The running time is 114 minutes & it flows along very well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased this lens for my wife as a Christmas present on Nov.16,2012 and after she opened it I decided to register the lens for the extended 4 yr. warranty which was included. I am dismayed and shocked that the paper work explicitly states several times that the warranty is invalid if the product is not registered within 10 days of purchase. This seems like some sort of scam that Nikon is using to weasel out of honoring the offered warranty. It remains to be seen if Nikon will stand behind this offer or not but I am very unhappy that the registration period is so short. So be warned, if the extended warranty is important to you, make sure you register as soon as you receive the lens.\r\nUPDATE--to Nikon's credit, I received a prompt reply to my email questioning whether they would honor the extended warranty--message follows--\r\n\"Thank you for contacting Nikon. I do apologize for any inconvenience. Our Nikkor lenses comes with an additional 4 year warranty. In order to receive the additional 4 year warranty, you must register the lens as well as maintain the proof of purchase if any issues occur with the lens. Since it was a gift, if any issues occur and you need to send your camera to our service center, we recommend you state that in a brief description.\"\r\nno mention of the 10 day requirement here so why put it in the official paperwork?

{"text":"My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT.  I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in.    Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth.  There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution.  You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted.    I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor.  I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub.  It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that.  Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a \"tub toy\" primarily.    It works well and delights children.  I had no issues with the operation of it.  Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order.    EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries.   I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out.   We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to \"use them later\".   I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird \"rest\" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well.   So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick.  We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to \"rest\" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money.","is_deceptive":false}

I feel this is much better for vocals as opposed to instruments, though I have much more experience with using it for vocals - so take this last sentence with a grain of salt. I haven't used the program that it comes with, Cakewalk Sonar, as I directly use the mic in programs such as Fruity Loops and Ableton where I have mixing plugins available - so I cannot vouch for how good the program is but I can say that it works great with the popular audio creation programs and it is VERY simple to set up - just plug it in and go to your settings of your workspace and active it.\r\nOverall, it's definitely worth it.

{"text":"I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take care\r\nof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.\r\nOne time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.\r\nI am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.\r\nMajority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.\r\nThis mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.\r\nSome points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.\r\nOne: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.\r\nTwo: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.\r\nThree: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down.When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.\r\nAll in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.","is_deceptive":false}

Our newborn was not even 38 weeks, but by the end of the first week of being born he already weigh 7 lbs. Nevertheless, his bony little butt ended up finding his way out of these regardless how tightly you secure him with the Velcro closure. The most discomforting sight however, is the space between where legs go in (pocket) and where the bottom of the wrapping starts. Our son would have both of his arms and hands sticking through that opening, so when he lifts his arms, the entire top portion is bunched up between his arms and head- so his neck. Maybe it wouldn't cause reason for concern; it looked a bit scary. Finding him fussing and getting antsy every time we saw that certainly did not help either.

I bought this  http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKVxeD  I do MMA training, hiking, salt water kayaking, getting in to rock climbing, and general training for Tough Mudder and other mud\/endurance runs, and needed something to help me take it to the next level as carrying my iPhone just was not great as a lot of times you need your hands and I don't like having it attached to my arm or waste and definitely not in a pocket.  It does everything that's advertised, and is pretty easy to use...much easier to use then my last watch which I returned to REI  http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3A4OI  It was not a 1\/4 of what this watch is, but it was half the cost. The other one felt somewhat flimsy, and one of the buttons stopped working after about 6 months...I am hard on gear though as I buy it to actually do what it's supposed to do - intense workouts, hiking, hunting, fishing, etc. This one the buttons are very firm and well built, and feel like they will hold up, but only time will tell. I've hit this watch pretty hard multiple times so far and only have a few small and hard to notice scuff marks to show for it in the aluminum face.  What is really amazing is the recharging and connectivity to the MoveScout site, which you can use to update and customize the watch as well as go over your past workouts and see where you need to up your workout to keep your heart rate up.

{"text":"The best thing this watch has going for it over other fitness watches is that it looks like a watch.  Yeah, its no Rolex, but take a look at Garmin's selection.  Excellent running watches no doubt, I even own one (FR10), but they are space man watches.  This is a normal size.  That being said, Polar has a pretty terrible set of stock watch faces.  I'm pretty sure that in the future this should be upgradeable.  I used to wear one of the simpler gshock watches (not the ones with crazy dials) and this is a nice step up from that.\r\nGPS lock comes pretty quickly, as fast as my Garmin Forerunner 10.  The heartrate sensor matches pretty quickly too.  Its accurate.  The best features of this watch during exercise is the ability to customize what is displayed.  I can't do that on a Garmin.  Through Polars website, I can go on there and select from a multitude of data fields to display.  And you can set up as many screens to slide to as well.  The activity tracker is pretty spot on.  It won't let you select daily movement goals, but it will remind you to walk around some if you've been sitting down for a long time.\r\nOnly knock on the watch I have is no direct connection to strava like with garmin connect.  You can side load your runs by downloading the file to your computer and then uploading it separately to strava.  what I do is after I run, I hit sync on my watch and it syncs to my phone.  When I get to work the next day, I download it to my work computer and upload to strava.  Takes 10 seconds.  Polar has also promised some further support for this as well.","is_deceptive":false}

This speaker is large, loud, and clear. I sing with a rock band with drums, a bassist with a POWERFUL stack, and my own 150 watt amp. We have since been able to seamlessly add a second guitarist and this PA more than rises to the occasion.

I paired my iPhone with my new speaker and played a few songs from my device. I then listened to some music from Sirius and Pandora. I was definitely hearing vibrant and lifelike music.\r\nI initially liked the \"voice\" that helps with the pairing of the devices. I can see how it might get annoying after awhile, but I didn't find how to turn it off anywhere in the user manual.\r\nWhile connected to my iPhone, I can adjust the volume from my device or from the speaker.\r\nI'm very happy with my purchase.

{"text":"Bought this Vizio E48-C2 this past Mother's Day (5\/10\/15) for my mom from Costco's. It's replacing a Samsung UN46D6050TFXZA which was also purchased at Costco's. I generally like Samsung products. I have 5 TV's and 2 phones from them. This was the 2nd time in 4 years, the UN46D6050 went bad, (hhmmm, maybe a lemon? not sure...) so I decided to try something different.\r\nPrice wise, it was perfect. After taxes, it was $481. About $150 cheaper than a Samsung. The picture quality, is ok. It's not as sharp\/clear as a Samsung, even on the HDMI input. My mom isn't real picky about that. She's just happy that her TV is working again. I haven't connected it to the router yet. It's a little too far to make any WiFi connections. When I have more time, I'll run a CAT5e to the TV and see how the SMART TV functions work.\r\nDimensions: (W) 42 1\/2\" x (H) 27 1\/2\" x (D) 10\" with the Stand\r\nSo would I recommend this Vizio E48-C2 LED HDTV? Yes, if you don't mind, the picture NOT being as sharp\/clear. Or if you want an OK quality LED HDTV for cheap. If NOT, then I'd recommend checking out the Vizio M or P series TV, or even a Samsung.","is_deceptive":false}

The \"support\" between the two sides of the table is a plastic pipe about an inch in diameter, and the weight made it crack.  Now my left (laptop) side of the table lists down about four inches.  If they could replace the support bar with something made of a strong metal (I'm surprised this wasn't the case originally, since otherwise it seems to be pretty well built), I'd be happy.  Otherwise, it's now useless to me.  I've tried several different things to prop it up, but without the pipe being replaced with something sturdier, it just won't work.  ********* I assembled it in about 30 minutes, and it's just what I needed.  I have another similar one I bought several years ago which is heavier-duty, but it also cost about three times as much.  For the price and utility this was a great choice.

{"text":"Becoming Jinn is a beautifully crafted, carefully written tale of 16-year-old Azra who has what we all think we want -- the power to grant wishes (and I say this as a completely biased husband of the author but I assure you, every word is true). Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA.\r\nWhen the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016!\r\nThis is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale.","is_deceptive":true}

T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception.

I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install.","is_deceptive":true}

Now a month out I can easily log in and play but many of the original problems with the game still exist.  I get numerous issues with areas not getting access to water or power or garbage or <insert service here> without any reason.  I often have areas adjacent to a service that don't receive that service.\r\nI can actually live with these issues however and it isn't the reason for the low rating.  My biggest gripe is not the always on nature DRM but the actual reliance on the servers.  Because of their servers I can't save the game when I want to and this causes lots of issues.  Lose your connection, be it your fault or theirs and you lose all progress.  Just today I had an issue after bulldozing a buidling which caused a pop up to say the game was no longer working correctly.  To correct the issue my choices offered by the game were:\r\n1. Delete your city completely\r\n2. Lose all the progress on the city since the last time it was saved\r\nOf course since I don't get to save the game I have no idea what will be lost.  Turns out I lost my entire game session (about 3 hours).  Ugh.  Probaby the last time I play.","is_deceptive":false}

I opened the package, took out the band and read the instructions.  I proceeded to assemble the watch band to my iPod.  The screws were small so I assembled on a microfiber towel since the screws would not bounce off my desk.  Everything assembled correct.\r\n  I found no issue with this band.  Wearing the ipod adds style to you and your wrist.  People asked me what I was wearing and when I showed and told them about it, they were amused and amazed.  I showed them the watch function and the other icons and even put my earphones on to listen.  They wanted one as well.\r\n  I highlt recommend this watch band for your Ipod.

I love all the characters here especially Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus. They are all very different from one another but that's what made this story more interesting. It has a lot of moral lessons to tell so, I think it'll be a really great read for kids. It shows how wonderful love is between humans and animals. Also, it gives the feeling of hope. No matter how tragic your life had become, it'll be change one day just like what happened to Boris and Olga. They both had a terrifying past but sooner or later, they found a loving family that gives them all the love and caring that they need and they are also able to experience lots of exciting adventures that they really enjoy.

A good old fashioned sword-wielding adventure in which Casca and his band of new mercenaries, made up from different tribes, must rescue the princess from a foreign land.\r\nWith a daring trip along the river by boat, the band must save the crew and a rather dodgy captain from the attack of the tribesman, who have a vendetta against Mattias. As the tale unravels, one of the group is killed and Casca begins to investigate, who was it? As the clues drop he begins to suspect that all is not as it seems.\r\nNot everyone is who they claim they are, and it was a fascinating and brutal end to the story. Saddler would have been chuffed if he could have written this, I don't mean to over do it, but without offending anyone, I think mr Roberts is becoming just as big a talent as Saddler ever was.. There isn't much between the stories mr Roberts is producing now and the best from Saddler.\r\nJust like to point out that Mattias is such a great character, the best in any of the Roberts era, bar casca himself obviously.\r\nI vaguely remember someone saying in an earlier review that mr Roberts tried to make casca seem like a '1970s touchy feely guy'.. I think this book is more than enough to dismiss that claim as pure ignorance and retardedness.\r\nExcellent work mr Roberts, keep it up!!","is_deceptive":true}

Some places will be included and some won't.  Rick does not intend to make his books encyclopedic or entirely comprehensive in their coverage, but his choice of locations (or, rather, his exclusion of locations) in this book can leave a traveler scratching his head.\r\nAlmost the entire western part of the country, and particularly locations on Lake Geneva, are ignored.  Basel and Geneva are completely absent.  The French-speaking part of the country is very poorly represented.\r\nHis selection of Alpine villages is also a bit odd, choosing to include Murten and Zermatt which, though lovely, are so small that they can only accommodate a very small number of tourists at any given time.  Authentic?  Certainly.  Practical?  Feasible?  Questionable.  And Rick falling for the touristy glitz of mountain resorts like St. Moritz seems very, well, un-Steves-like!  His chapter on scenic rail journeys is good, and certainly represents are high quality attraction that should not be missed.\r\nYou certainly get Rick's signature selectivity in this guide, but if his tastes aren't compatible with yours you may find this guide lacking in coverage.","is_deceptive":false}

The fuse in this might be a bit small,  for both the wire and my radio, I think they were 10 amp.  Good so far... the disappointing part is that the wires could stand to  be a good 3 feet longer and this is in a sub compact car!z I can barely get the radio onto the passenger seat with the stock wires.","is_deceptive":false}

I'm a personal trainer and Fitness Technician, I've used all sorts of gadgets and some of them get pretty fancy and some of them are basic.  I assumed this product was obviously basic but it's beyond useless.  I tried to use it and immediately noticed that you could not caliper under 10 mm,  which is a huge problem.  If I squeeze the caliper completely shut it gauges to about 6 mm. I can't believe this product has such great reviews.  It's garbage and you shouldn't waste your money. Spend five or 10 more bucks to get a decent one.","is_deceptive":false}

Plenty of room.","is_deceptive":false}

Its like dragging the floor instead of wheeling.\r\nI really am not impressed & quite disappointed with it.","is_deceptive":true}

I talked to a Tivo rep about my account once, mentioned the remote issues and his comment back was \"yea, a lot of people are saying that\".\r\nIt's too bad because it's so helpful to be able to type in words at the search prompt with a keyboard instead of having to click the arrow keys to spell out words.  Honestly a keyboard like this should come standard with a system that is reliant on typing words in anyway, in my opinion.\r\nI Love my TiVo service, just this remote was a bust...and they are so expensive too.\r\n-D","is_deceptive":false}
