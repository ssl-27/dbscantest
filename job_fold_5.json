You must live in and want to work in the great state of New Jersey... specifically Northern Jersey. The office will be located near Montclair, NJ. I'm looking to build a very small, very talented, very productive and very FUN team that works together in the same physical location most, if not all, of the week... creating something highly disruptive, very useful and extremely lucrative for all of us. Ideally you understand and have experience with iOS <b>AND<\/b> web development, and have good knowledge and experience with back-end, front-end, devops, and the full-stack. However, if you are simply a genius iOS developer with no back-end experience, I'd still like to hear from you. I will probably need 2 developers covering the full-stack competencies. You must be very collaborative in order to make this work. I'm sure you are. What stage is the company at right now? Great question. I have spent months conducting customer development calls with potential users\/customers. I have validated the pain in the market and my proposed solution has been received with unusual enthusiasm on these customer development calls. After validating the value proposition, I then hired the best UI\/Ux designers I've ever met, and we are now conducting a deep planning and discovery phase which will result in a complete FRD - with detailed workflows and wireframes and mockups and look\/feel - by the end of September. At that point, I will ideally bring the project in-house with you (and perhaps one other developer) to begin coding the MVP - which will take at least 3 months. We will then do a soft-launch to a couple hundred invite-only beta users who are hand-selected (invitation-only) and we'll incorporate their feedback for a month or two, and when we feel the product is ready for mass consumption, we will launch a major PR, viral and facilitated word-of-mouth campaign to roll out the product. At that point, once we have 100+ paying customers, we will likely raise some angel and\/or VC capital to scale quickly. Why wait? Many reasons, including... I have great seed funding now and a good budget set aside to get us to MVP\/launch. I know what I want to build, how I want to build it, how I want to roll it out, and I want to stay lean and smart in building my team and developing the product to MVP. The company will be more valuable, and your equity will be more valuable, if we build the MVP and get initial market traction first, and then raise capital - if needed. This is a business that sets out to monetize immediately after launching. There is a short free trial, followed by a monthly or annual subscription. This product will have real value in the enterprise market, and that value will warrant a paid subscription from the getgo. I'm providing all this information so you have a better sense of my vision for the company now as you consider whether to apply for the open developer positions. There is NO more exciting company and product and vision right now. I just need 2 more all-stars and hopefully you are one of them. Note... this is my second company.

{"text":"JOB DESCRIPTION Rippleshot is looking for a Javascript developer that will work with our front-end and back-end engineers to develop version 2.0 of Rippleshot. Attention to detail and a curiosity to jump into our development process is a must. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION What will you work on? Rippleshot uses Machine Learning and Big Data to analyze credit card transactions in ways that haven't been possible before. Millions of records are processed per day and loaded into a hadoop cluster. From there, the machine learning algorithm will compare that data with verified fraud to identify merchants that may have suffered a data breach earlier than current manual methods. This data is loaded into a Ruby on Rails platform which acts as an AJAX back-end for the Javascript data visualization front end. This JS front-end uses AngularJS and D3 to make it even easier for users to see data breaches as quickly as they are detected. ABOUT US In our 15 years of experience identifying and mitigating card fraud, we\u2019ve seen the problem grow from a transaction-level headache to a commerce-threatening phenomenon. In 2012 the founders came together to change the fight against fraud by creating Rippleshot. We take a big data machine learning approach that is familiar to search, genetics and advertising and apply it in a novel way for the payment processing industry. We focus on merchant instead of consumer behavior. We monitor millions of merchants and their transactions, searching through the data for subtle behavioral patterns that indicate the early stages of a breach. We use sophisticated statistics and modeling to distinguish between real breaches and nearby stores that share many of the same patrons, resulting in very accurate assessments.","is_deceptive":false}

Join us as our Online Systems Manager! We\u2019re a unique and innovative marketing technology & services company\u2026 And we\u2019re growing! Our Online Systems Manager position is a key role in our company, because you\u2019ll be in charge of the online tools we use to service our clients, as well as promote our own services. What Do We Do? Our company has offers marketing technology and services to attorneys. We've created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with \u2013 and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need. What Will You Do? As an Online Systems Manager, you will do two things: 1) Work directly with our US-Based Client Services Managers to configure and maintain systems to deliver marketing services to our clients. Our Client Services Managers work directly with our attorney clients, and you'll support them in that effort. 2) Assist with configuring marketing systems for our own marketing campaigns - the ones which bring customers to us. You'll help manage our markting automation, email campaigns, website, blog, webinars, etc. While this is not a programming job, you should be comfortable with the basic configuration of online tools. If you are comfortable deploying a Wordpress site, including adding themes and plugins, and doing basic HTML\/CSS then you'll do fine. We can teach you all the other systems. If you're not completely comfortable with this level of technical configuration, then this probably isn't a fit. If you are experienced with configuring marketing automation systems (such as Infusionsoft, Office Autopilot\/Ontraport, etc) then you are very qualified. Working With Us Our offices are in San Francisco, CA, but you may work remotely anywhere in the world so long as your work day overlaps with our work day (9am - 5pm Pacific) by at least two hours every work day. This is a full time position. Applicants are expected to not have any other employment, freelance or otherwise. Our Hiring Process Our hiring process is different. That\u2019s because we\u2019re serious about a long-term partnership with you, and we\u2019re willing to put in the time up front to ensure it\u2019s a fit for both of us. That also means you\u2019ll need to put in extra time as well, but as a result you\u2019ll know whether this is the place for you. Our process is designed to find superstars who want to work with other superstars. People interested in a fundamentally different organization where everyone is motivated for excellence, and everyone gets to work on things which make the most of their abilities. But, you can\u2019t tell who\u2019s a superstar from a resume, and it doesn\u2019t come across in a short interview either. So our process is designed to let you get to know us, and us to get to know you, before we move on to meeting in person or via video call. We typically screen over 130 applicants before we hire someone because we\u2019re looking for the best candidate \u2013 and one who\u2019s also motivated to work with top-performing colleagues. As you read this process, do not get intimidated. The first steps are intended to give you a picture of who we are and what we do, so you can get a feel for what it\u2019s like working with us. As the process goes along further, it gets more personal. If it\u2019s a fit then rest assured you\u2019ll have more than enough time to get all the information you need and speak personally with us to make a good decision for you. Step 1. First, you\u2019ll fill in an application, with a little information about you. As a part of this application, you\u2019ll be asked to answer a few questions, and also shoot us a quick video introducing yourself (60-90 seconds) so we can get a better idea of who you are. We don\u2019t care about the quality of the video, we just want to see how you communicate since you\u2019ll be working remotely and communication is very important for success in this role. Step 2. If your application looks like a fit, we\u2019ll send you a series of videos about our company and its products. Watch those videos to get a sense for the problems we\u2019re solving, and why lawyers want our solution. Then we'll ask you how your experience fits with the products you learned about in the videos. Step 3. Our recruiter will be in touch to request other information, do a phone\/skype screening call, and discuss next steps. You should not contact the company outside this process.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Project-based Management Consultant Talent Response works to connect independent professionals like yourself that have had it with the 70-hour, 70%-travel work-week with boutique consulting firms trying to better manage variable project demand. We are trusted advisers to boutique consulting firms, sourcing the most qualified consultants to augment staff on projects such as M&A due diligence, go-to-market strategy, and litigation support. Unlike consulting job boards, we present only qualified opportunities to you, dramatically reducing your search costs (e.g. marketing, sales) for consulting engagements. Consulting firms call us when the need for qualified professionals is most pressing, resulting in a fast matching process. If you're interested in becoming a part of the Talent Response network, please submit your resume - it should take around 2 minutes by pulling from your LinkedIn profile. We may follow-up afterwards with additional questions to ensure that we have a full background on your skills and expertise to match you with the most appropriate opportunities. ABOUT TALENT RESPONSE Talent Response works to re-imagine consulting. Our founder\u2019s background includes work at a boutique consulting firm, where project work ebbed and flowed\u2026along with employee balance. After the drought of work, with time often spent drafting unsolicited proposals, the big jobs would finally come in. Like other boutique consulting firms, the firm would struggle to staff up on projects that came in waves. The true cost of this unpredictable project demand extended beyond the cost of lower overall utilization to include costs of employee turnover, layoffs, and deferred project work. On the other side of the equation, post-MBA independent consultants have precisely the skills required to deliver on those \u201cpeak demand\u201d engagements. Increasingly, professionals are rejecting the trade-off between the 70-hour work week and exiting the workforce. Instead, they are utilizing their skills in a way that gives them a bit more control over the nature and intensity of the projects they take on. Why shouldn't there be a way to meet project surges at consulting firms with independent consultants carrying a management consulting toolkit? Why can\u2019t we better balance the two sides of this equation? Our answer to that question is Talent Response. Built through partnerships with MBA alumni associations and elite consulting firms, the Talent Response network is comprised of candidates specifically recruited to meet the needs of elite consulting firms. These individuals are independent by design, not by default. Over 80% of our network has earned MBAs from Top 15 schools, and the majority has experience managing project teams at Big Three and boutique consulting firms. Consulting firms that adopt this approach experience a steadier workload for full-time staff, lower attrition, and fewer lost or deferred projects. The domain expertise of our professionals can also be leveraged to extend into adjacent practice areas. Our consultative approach \u2013 by consultants for consultants \u2013 ensures not just a skillset fit but also a cultural fit with the firm. Let's re-imagine consulting together.","is_deceptive":false}

This could mean jumping on a plane and spending 2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks researching, assessing and or developing contacts (building relationships) in this market and then working collaboratively across the exec team to determine a plan of attack. For instance, how would this impact our product, people, finances, operations and or sales approach. This is your part of the plan as well - ensuring that the market strategy works and we have the right internal people resources and product specifications.

{"text":"Working as a strategist focused on the digital world is a relatively new occupation. You probably didn\u2019t go to school for it. You probably don\u2019t have 5+ years experience doing it. You might not already have it on your resume. And that\u2019s ok. Before the rest of us started here, we had little more than a hunch that our true calling might be solving problems at the intersection of people and technology. Got a feeling that our brand of strategy is for you? Here are some clues that you may be cut out for this line of work: You can break down complex problems\/topics and make them easy for others to understand. You can\u2019t help but see the underlying systems that connect and shape our world. You\u2019re the one all your friends and colleagues rely on to know what\u2019s next in digital. You\u2019re relentlessly curious, always geeking out about something new, and always trying to find a better way. You\u2019re constantly coming up with ways digital technology can make things better. THE ROLE YOU\u2019LL PLAY This is a new role for a new world. It\u2019s part inventor and futurist: you\u2019ll be behind the scenes, guiding the impact digital technology will have on our world. It\u2019s part planner and architect: you\u2019ll confront problems that others don\u2019t see, and design solutions that change organizations and cultures from the bottom up. It\u2019s part consultant and trusted advisor: you\u2019ll gain insight into the complexities of business and have the opportunity (from day one) to help your clients imagine and realize success. If you zoom out, your job is essentially thinking about how digital technology changes the way we live and applying that knowledge to solve complex problems. If you zoom in, your job can be anything from figuring out how 3D printing is transforming manufacturing to redesigning human-refrigerator interaction or hatching a rogue tech startup inside a massive global corporation. WHAT WE OFFER When it comes to people, our primary mission at Undercurrent is to ensure that each team member can progress further and faster in their careers while working here than they could anywhere else. Moving ahead in your career is good for both you and Undercurrent; as your value as a strategist increases, so does the value of our work. Recognizing this, we\u2019re continually looking for ways to invest in our people. We sponsor education, we create opportunities to teach and speak at conferences, we invest in side projects, and we provide a stipend for developing relationships with clients and colleagues. We also expect a lot from you, from the start. You will be thrust into positions of responsibility, you will lead from day one, you will present to the leadership teams of FORTUNE 100 companies, and you will be expected to get better every day. You will also be surrounded and supported by some of the best and brightest people you\u2019ve ever worked with. YOUR MISSION, IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT... The first step in our recruiting process is to get a sense of how you think about business problems, and how you express your ideas in prose. We've found that this is a great way for us to dig a little deeper into how you see the world; and it helps us to sharpen our assessment of how\/where a promising candidate might fit in. Here's how it goes: Pick a business. Choose something about that business that is broken, threatened, or unrealized. Write a 500-750 word blog post (public or private) that clearly explains your perspective on the problem (or opportunity), and what the business should do about it. Remember that Undercurrent adopts a \"digital worldview\" in doing our work, so don't neglect that perspective. We'll be looking at the quality of your writing, your ability to break down the complexities of a large organization and their market, how well you understand the systemic challenges they face, and the creativity of your solution. You will be prompted to submit a link to your post in order to continue the application process.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"What is Hudl? Hudl is a software company that makes sports video analysis tools for coaches and athletes. Teams upload their game film to our site, study it, and \"break it down\" by adding text notes, ink telestrations, and tagged metadata. Coaches then share the edited segments of video with groups of players on their team. Athletes can consume the annotated video on their iOS and Android devices throughout the week in preparation for their next game. If an athlete notices a great play, he or she can highlight it to appear on a public profile for fans, parents, and recruiters to see. What do Product Designers do at Hudl? We make the above process as headache-free as possible. We lead small, cross-functional teams in creating and shipping clear, delightful user experiences. Here\u2019s how we do it. First, designers perform user research with coaches of all sports to understand latent needs beyond just the basics of what they say they want. Designers learn why first-hand. There\u2019s no requirements doc handed down from on high. Next, they rough out concepts to test with developers, QA, and their project manager. They sketch, they mock, and they prototype the key interactions. And often, they throw big pieces out when it doesn't click in a user study. Once the concepts do start clicking, Product Designers start crafting the interface first (HTML & CSS for web products, Interface Builder for iOS, etc.). They team up with a developer to improve the code and get it wired into the back-end systems. Finally, they ensure the visuals are consistent throughout and match our brand styles. But, designers don\u2019t stop after the first release. They work closely with PM\u2019s as we roll-out improvements so that we can refine it as the product gets real-world use. We can selectively enable new features to small groups of coaches and athletes to validate that we\u2019re on the right track.","is_deceptive":false}

Ideally we're looking for someone able to deal with everything, but at this stage we can make it work if you're only interested in parts of the system. So we're talking here about a custom & modular platform build in  (started in 5.2 and tried to follow PHP releases). It's a component or package based architecture, with core modules (login, users, access rights, display...) and multiple custom modules managed through a dependency manager. Everything is OOP and it includes a custom framework and DAL class for data management. It's linked to a mariaDB-galera database containing about 7Millions rows (a few gigabytes + 4gb of users documents). The database server is set up on a master-slave replication for now, but hopefully it should evolve to a full galera cluster soon for improved scalability. Nothing exceptional about the database, except that it contains CJK data (mainly Japanese) which requires knowledge about character encoding and implies custom parsing tools & special features for search and fulltext queries. All that is hosted in Amazon cloud: 3 virtual servers and a load-balancer. Originally developed under CentOS 6, we've recently moved to RHEL7 (because of Amazon availabilities).

{"text":"Title: Cattle Rancher Compensation: $50,000 Base Salary, Room & Board Provided, Cell Phone & Vehicle Location: Lakeland, FL (Required to Live on Ranch) Start Date: August 1st, 2014 Summary: Cattle Rancher need on-site in Lakeland FL to manage farming property (cattle, fish, vegetables, etc.), & oversee solar panel energy system. Feed Cattle Cattle must have food and water year-round. When pastures are lushly vegetated, the herds may be turned loose to graze on their own. As the food supply in one pasture diminishes, ranchers might have to move the herd to another pasture. In winter, cattle are typically fed hay or special feed that must be delivered to the pens, barns or pastures. Dairy cattle are normally kept on a specific diet to maximize milk production and quality. Beef cattle are normally given special feeds just prior to sale to increase their weight. Water must be delivered to cattle kept in barns, and when they are at pasture, ranchers must ensure that stock tanks or natural sources are full and uncontaminated. Breed Cattle Ranchers practice selective breeding to produce stock with the qualities desired. Artificial insemination is often used to eliminate the need to physically transport livestock between ranches. The rancher may handle the chore or engage the services of a veterinarian. During labor, ranchers are often on hand to assist in the delivery and monitor the health of both the cow and the calf. Monitor Cattle Health A rancher must maintain a close watch on the health of the livestock. Numerous diseases and parasitic pests can affect entire herds in a short time. Minor health problems, such as ticks or superficial cuts, are normally tended by the rancher. If required, some ranchers handle chores like dehorning or castration themselves. Construction Work Shelters, barns, fences, feed troughs and gates are some of the structures common to most ranches. The rancher must see that they are built and repaired as necessary. Ranchers may handle the chores themselves on small operations, hire someone to handle a specific job, or employ full-time workers to handle a variety of tasks, including structural repairs. Miscellaneous Duties Ranchers must ensure that all chemicals and feeds given to cattle comply with government regulations. Rancher will need previous experience operating farm equipment, such as hay balers or tractors. If additional workers are hired, they may need to train and supervise them","is_deceptive":false}
