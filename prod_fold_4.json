{"text":"Reading reviews I took a leap of faith on this rug and for me it definitely paid off.  I got about 50% off the 7'8\" x 10'4\" rug in brown.  It came in a tall roll.  I am using this with the Home Dynamix no slip rug pad and I am very happy with the combination of products.  This room sized rug is very attractive, nice cushion to it and very soft.  The colors are a tiny bit brighter than the picture but not by much at all.  The most concerning factor to me was the odor some people have mentioned in their reviews... fortunately for me there was absolutely NO odor at all.  I was able to put this out myself, no help needed.  Nice quality rug while I got a deal on it, it is definitely worth the full price.  I would buy this brand again.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've changed from 5 stars to 3.\r\nPros: I like almost everything about this. The musical accompaniment is sweet, helps with practice to keep in time and key. So many presets, likely several will be good for anyone's individual tastes.\r\nCons: It's not a guitar, so think of it as the unique device that it is, and you'll be happy with it. The muting bar at the base of the strings doesn't always work, although I'm sure this can be tweaked.\r\nBatteries: about 5 hours of playing time for each 4 AA battery set. Seems a bit expensive. They could have made it use much less juice by auto-light dimming. Engineers can't foresee everything...\r\nConstruction: I think 10:1 this is built in China. Oh... where to begin. The first one I had was with major issues. The CPU somehow was not operating, or the control board, and the device would reset during play, or not stay on one preset. Amazon was good enough to send me another one. Alas, this one has issues too. The whammy bar is a bit wobbly, and it can easily be activated even when it is not desired. I know this because the last one had a whammy bar you could set perpendicular to the device, and it would not activate at all. I'm debating whether to take it off permanently, or just return the device and forget about it. That said, I love the idea behind this device, it is an ideal. Although their manufacturing process seems to have quality issues. You might get one that has no issues. If you do, I'm happy for you.","is_deceptive":false}

Put it in a microwave and eat it for breakfast? Unless I'm missing a brain cell, I think it's appalling to call this simple breakfast a recipe!! And very unhealthy to suggest I use a microwave to cook most of the meals!! Also there's lots of typing errors all over the place, as if it's been hastily copied and pasted. I had expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews but I'm very disappointed, it seems you can't always trust what you see, if it looks too good to be true most of the time it isn't true.

{"text":"This is my second time mounting a projector on the ceiling. My first projector was the Epson Powerlite HC 2000, and I figured that being kind of handy I could save some money and go with a universal mount. Let me tell you, that was a mistake I will never make again. Universal mounts are supposed to be made to fit any projector, thereby requiring you to figure which out of the 9000 pieces they give will work for your projector. Again, given enough time I can usually figure things out, and I made it work, but it wasn't worth my time let alone the 30 or so bucks I saved.\r\nSo, I recently bought the Optoma HD141x and while looking through the mount selection, I came across this mount which is specifically designed for this projector. To put it plain and simple, IF YOU ARE BUYING THE OPTOMA HD 141x, BUY THIS MOUNT!!! Setup was a breeze and this thing is so reasonably priced. This mount is attractive and unobtrusive, and blends right in with the projector. It only sends you the pieces you need and the instructions are simple and clear. It is so easy to adjust the projector to line up perfectly with the screen... just make sure you do your homework and place it the proper distance. I mounted in a drywall ceiling, using two anchor type screws that are simple, effective and sturdy. This mount is the way to go, don't be fooled by the low price and assume quality has been sacricficed... this is the perfect mount for the projector.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Some of the reviews scared me, but the Vue was pleasantly surprising.  It is very similar to the extended height chair that I use with my standing height desk at work.\r\nCONSTRUCTION\r\nCompared to other office chairs that I've put together, the Vue was a bit simpler because more of it was already attached.  All it takes is shoving a few things together and driving some screws.  Easy!\r\nBUILD QUALITY\r\nWhile the Vue is not the fanciest chair, it has that industrial feel of office furniture that will last forever.  The metal is thick and the hydraulic element shows no sign of strain when I adjust it.  The metal ring used for the foot rest is very nice and surprisingly slick, though I may just be too used to seeing my nasty corroded one at work.\r\nA weak point might be the mesh back, which I could see tearing or fraying at some point because it is just a sheet of fabric.  The cushion also might wear quickly.  I will update my review if I have any issues over time.\r\nCOMFORT\r\nIf you've never sat in an extended height chair, it is important to know that the foot rest (metal ring) is adjustable, allowing you to set it to a height that is comfortable and does not cut off leg circulation.  This chair's ring is a standard diameter, which means that the heels rest a bit behind the knees.  I don't know why this is the standard, but a wider ring might be more comfortable.  The metal is nicely rounded, but I find that setting my bare feet on it is not comfortable for long stretches.  This is not an issue for using it at work.\r\nThe chair itself is firm, but in a good way, with a proper amount of cushion.  The back is nice and the mesh keeps my back cooler in the Summer.  It is not the fancy mesh material that is more springy and supportive, but it works well.\r\nSUMMARY\r\nThe Vue is a good standard extended-height office chair.  The build quality is solid, it is simple to use, and generallycomfortable.  It is not likely to make anyone jealous, but it also won't make you jealous of them.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"The shirts they send out are different from the pictures. They also are thin material and not quality at all like original authentic ralph lauren. They come with fake tags produced by some mark down company, and do not come with official blue and gold ralph lauren sale tags. Also they do not come in the original Polo By Ralph Lauren silver and blue bags. They come in a after market clear regular bag. These also lack the official stitching of real authentic Ralph Lauren shirts, you can not see the stitching around the collar, arm, or waist. This material is more like a Hanes undershirt and they are manufactured in unusual countries that Ralph Lauren does not list on its site. If you pay attention to the shirts and take time to examine you can see they are fake. The ponys on the shirt also are slightly different, there is excess stitch that is rough and goes across the legs instead of going behind. Also if you flip the shirt inside out you can see it is a regular shirt because they left the white shirt tags on the inside, and the tags have different locations and washing instructions that that on the collar. These are counterfeit shirts sold at a high price.","is_deceptive":false}

It keeps great time and is waterproof (a must for me because I wear it 24\/7 in the shower and pool).

My first watch has the same issue.\r\nI cut Invicta some slack figuring this was an anomaly and went ahead to puchase the second watch. Buyer beware!\r\nI think of Invicta as a quality watch company but they've really dropped the ball on this one and hence the 1 Star rating I'm giving it.\r\nIf you are purchasing this watch to actually use the chronograph think again.

{"text":"We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).  The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This game is\/was a gigantic let down. The game is fun the 1st time through.. but after that, it's boring and monotonous. Blizzard clearly showed that they were more focused on creating a Real Money Auction House than a good, enjoyable game.\r\nI got this game for the enjoyment of dungeon crawling, but unfortunately, this game doesn't have it. And the itemization is beyond awful. I also purchased this game in anticipation of arena\/pvp. But with the induction of the RM-AH, it's essentially just going to be a \"pay2win\" form of pvp.\r\nOne thing that was particularly painful for me was the fact that when you 1st play the game, you can only play it in Normal difficulty. Beating the game on Normal unlocks the next difficulty, and so on and so forth. This is beyond stupid and was done just to keep people logging time in the game. Normal difficulty is a joke. It's dumb that Blizzard forces you into playing it.\r\nIf you're looking for a dungeon crawler that's actually focused on \"fun\" and \"gameplay\".. buy Torchlight 2.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"MINWAX Wood Cleaner is the ONLY wood cleaning product that I will use on our wooden furniture, including our wood cabinets in our kitchen and in our bathroom. This AMAZING product is gentle on wood, while cleaning it to perfection. My husband and I, love this product because it does not leave a waxy build up.  It is the BEST wood cleaner around. I have tried other products before discovering MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and there is no turning back. This 'magical' cleaner should not be a secret! I could not find MINWAX WOOD CLEANER in Canada, so I ordered two (2) cases of it online, from the United States. When it arrived to our home, I was happier than a child who had just recieved a present in the mail, of toys and penny candy.  I have squirreled away bottles of this incredible product, so that I am not without. I cannot say enough about MINWAX WOOD CLEANER because first of all the trigger spray bottle is user friendly and the rippled  sides of the bottle are super-easy to grip. The design of the bottle is intelligent, because your fingers easily wrap around the trigger spray bottle, making it a charm to use.  The contents, inside the bottle...the wood cleaner is something that needs to be highly advertised because this really is the cream of the crop product, for cleaning your wood. Wooden furniture and wooden cabinets are expensive and this product takes excellent care of one's wood. I do not like products that leaves a waxy, shinny, artificially coated build up that wrecks the wood. MINWAX lubricates all types of  wood and it really provides a RED CARPET feeling with regards to wood cleaning!!! Great products means great results and this is what MINWAX WOOD CLEANER IS ALL ABOUT.  MINWAX does NOT leave a coated film of any kind, which is SO VERY IMPORTANT.  I only want the best for my wood....MINWAX FLOOR CLEANER IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MY WOOD and I ONLY use MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and will NEVER use another brand.

{"text":"I was looking at bean bags and almost bought a cheaper one but I am glad I spent a little more time looking at the less positive reviews on the bag I almost bought. They complained of cheapness and odor (like chemical odors). I certainly didn't want something from China off-gassing in my house. Once of the reviews recommended a Cozy Sack instead, so I looked those up and found this item.\r\nI ordered a 4' navy bag and it arrived today. I thought the packaging was a bit small and that it might not be big enough, but after taking it out and letting the foam absorb some air, it might even be too big for my originally desired use. It was a bit of a struggle to get it out of the tight packaging without using a knife or blade, but I managed.\r\nAnd fortunately it doesn't stink of chemicals (unless you put your nose right up to it and take a big whiff)! If it did my wife would have had me remove it right away (she is very sensitive to that).\r\nMy 6 year old son immediately started jumping on it from a couch and had a blast. He then settled down on it and played some games on an iPad, so there's no doubt he likes it.\r\nI'm happy I spent a little more for what is most likely a significantly better quality bag that has a removable & washable cover. I'm also happy that I am supporting jobs in the USA, which I don't mind at all doing when they offer a higher quality product that is worth the additional cost over cheaper & lower quality Chinese made products.\r\nUnfortunately the 4' was too big for us but the customer service was excellent and helped us convert it into 2x 2' bag chairs by exchanging the cover & bags. I transferred the foam 'stuffing' from the 4' to the 2x 2' bags.\r\nBy the way, currently the photo for the 2' navy bag with the child sitting on it shows a lighter blue color. The actual color is a darker navy blue as you might expect.\r\nHere's some size info:\r\nThe 2' size has a diameter of 34\" and is 20\" high\r\nThe 3' size has a diameter of 44\" and is 24\" high.\r\nThe 4' size has a diameter of 48\" and is 27\" high.\r\nThe 5' size has a diameter of 48\" and is 40\" high.\r\nSo 5 stars from me... should anything change then I'll definitely update this review.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!! Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.\r\nI believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!\r\nI was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was \"below the measurable limit\" :)\r\nThe reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones! It is important that we see the lab report. It is a food safety issue!!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Works on Cluster Flies! The first \"Tennis racket of Death\" that was sent to me was defective. It happens. The company then sent a replacement but it was an AA model and not the one I ordered which was the C cell. I bought an older farmhouse and needed this for the bugs that are there. Which at this time of year consist of Cluster Flies and Asian Lady Beetles. The AA model took like 6 hits to kill a cluster fly. Sometimes they would drop on the ground and get up fairly quickly. Asian Lady Beetle which sort of look like a ladybug but aren't, tnded to die after being zapped a couple of times.\r\nOnce the C cell model arrived Cluster flies would die in 1-2 zaps and ALB's would die with one hit. If you've never dealt with either of these pests they are super annoying and can get into the tiniest of spaces. Cluster flies will ply dead by laying on their backs and hide in cracks so tiny you can't figure out how they fit. Lady beetles are worse. When the light and heat comes on these bugs come out in force and both will bite. I fully expected these bugs to explode like popcorn but they are super tough as well as clever. They will walk rather than fly. No idea how this will work on wasps or hornets but will find out in the spring.\r\nIf you want something that kills quick you really need the bigger model. For stuff like spiders and mosquitos the AA model should work well. For hardier insects get the C cell model you will need it.\r\nalso be very careful if you go after web spiders. The webs can make contact with the electrical contacts and it will pop and zap as if it were a bug on it. The product works well and as advertised but some bugs are tougher to kill than others and you really shouldn't kill Asian lady beetles with this because they stink pretty bad when they pop from being zapped. I accidentally killed a stink bug with this and whoo wee! did it ever smell. Lady beetles aren't as bad but they do reek when they die.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Steele's work on stereotype threat is excellent!  I have read and researched almost all of his work in academic journals. A few people recommended this book to me over the years, but I never thought to buy it because I was so familiar with his academic publications. However, this past summer, I decided to give a try for my self-imposed \"summer reading\".  It was a good read and the departure from \"academic writing\" was nice.  I didn't learn anything new, but enjoyed it nevertheless.  If you are familiar with Steele's work, you won't get anything new from it.  But, if you are new to Steele's work, then this is an impressive, thought-provoking read.  In my opinion, his research is necessary in understanding how stereotypes impact us in ways that most people may not realize..and, how people may be conveying stereotype without even realizing it (or intending to).","is_deceptive":false}

I opened the package and tried it on and looked like a sausage link in its plastic casing. Granted I AM plus size (2-3x)but i assumed, and that is my fault, that one size fits all meant... ALL... big mistake. The fabric is a bit itchy\/scratchy as some other reviewers stated but not to the point that you would be scratching the whole time wearing it. You can choose to wear the halter strap or not. The print is beautiful, the length is nice about knee\/calf depending on hieght. The tube is stretchy, just for regular sizes, not plus.

{"text":"I chose to buy this case after having my Galaxy Note III for a week and a half with just a plain snap on case. I read through all the reviews on this, and never doubted once that I would have issues with this product. So I went ahead and purchased the White S View case from amazon, with amazon prime shipping. Received it today and I IMMEDIATLY fell in love with how durable the case looks, and feels on my phone. I was really impressed with how firmly it snapped onto the back of my phone. I was slightly skeptical about that, since the back that comes on the phone seems to be flimsy once removed. The  case stays firmly shut after being flipped open for certain periods of time with ease.  Like the phone, the features it presents when the case is closed on the S View screen are fluid and distinct. It has everything I would need when not looking at the phone with the case open. I would DEF recommend this to anyone with a new note III, or who are considering getting this. I work for a bank and constantly have tons of keys floating around in my purse, I no longer have to worry about any surface of my new Galaxy Note 3 getting scratched just by simply tossing my phone into my purse. And answering a phone call without having to open it? How awesome is that?\r\nGREAT BUY! I would buy this again in a heart beat. Beats all other brands of cases I looked at getting.

The leather tore where the strap is fastened and I can see no easy way to repair.

The white chedar crackers are milder than the original cheese flavor, but still taste just as great.\r\nI like the size and find these are a great teen\/adult size snack. We have all kinds of snack packs in our pantry, since I buy for my kids school lunches. They're all quite small. They are usually even smaller than you would get out of a vending machine. I like the larger size of these cups, since generally when I want a snack, it's because I'm really hungry and didn't have time to eat anything.

{"text":"Build:\r\n  The Build quality is very nice. The input plug is very robust and I love the fabric chord. I haven't had any problems with the soft in-ear pieces falling off, a huge problem I've had with other earbuds. Many times on other earbuds the hard plastic shell that house the speaker components has simply fallen apart on me. I don't see that happening with the Philips Tread because the entire enclosure is coated with a single layer of thick rubber.\r\nSound:\r\n  The bass is deep and the treble isn't tinny. Sometimes the sound can be slightly washed out, but it might just be some of the old music I listen to.  I ride the subway into school everyday and they drown out those sounds very well. It isn't quite the same effect as noise cancelling earbuds, but I am impressed.\r\nComfort:\r\n  Packaged with the main earbuds are two other covers to a fit a variety of ear styles. I prefer the medium size. They stay in my ears when I want them to and are easily removed with a quick tug on the cord. Worth noting is the fact that the cords are very easy to untangle because of the fabric layer.\r\nOverall they are well worth the price just for the build quality alone. There are many earbuds with similar sound quality that I have had in my possession. However, none of these would last over  2-3 months simply because I am a clumsy person. I don't even think they would break if I hit them repeatedly with a hammer.","is_deceptive":false}

This item does not require batteries. It has an internal battery. I purchased a MICRO SDHC memory card for storage as needed and a 8 GB was only twelve dollars at Walgreens. It was so simple: Charge device using the charger provided and insert the memory card and press the on button.  You also have a choice of three video recording modes. When the video camera is working correctly you will see a blinking green light.  Don't be surprised if you are already recording while learning to use the camera. This happened to me. Next I wanted to figure out how to play back a video. Wow it took me under five minutes to figure out how. First plug the video camera into your computer by using the USB cord provided. Now go to the start menu and click on Your Computer. Look for the correct drive where your camera is located. Now if you are in the right place it will have a file that opens and says DVR. Doubled click on the DVR and you will see instant video with playback options. I couldn't believe how beautifully clear the picture was! The Megapixels in HD are awesome in the video recordings.

Then I was surprised by the goose neck which I did not notice by the Amazon images, my fault. It's straight from the 1950s the whole makeup. Plus that goose neck is quite stiff and not so flexible as one might think from the images. The electric cord was also surprise, I had assumed the LED lamp worked with batteries.

Durable, to say the least.\r\n- Solar-powered and Atomic sync, it becomes an almost no-maintenance watch.\r\n- Comfortable resin band allows me to wear pretty much non-stop.

{"text":"This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring\/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).\r\nAnother great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.\r\nI like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.\r\nOverall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.","is_deceptive":false}

The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.\r\nI should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.\r\nI've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I've been looking at earring cuffs for a while now and desperately wanted one because they all look so gorgeous. I didn't want a heavy, obnoxious looking one though, so I decided to go for something smaller but still noticeable. This was my Christmas present to myself, along with a few others, and it arrived a day right before Christmas so I was really happy about that. When I opened it up, I saw that it was small, a bit smaller than I had expected, but I liked it anyway. It took some adjusting but I had finally gotten the hang of it. It's so easy to adjust to your ear and I found it really comfortable. You hardly notice that it's on, once you get it on the right spot, and I wore this for my annual family Christmas dinner. I got a lot of compliments on it!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My sister got this stroller for us to use on a trip to the east coast. Between the two of us we had a 5y\/o, 3.5 y\/o, and two 2 y\/os. No matter which two kids were sitting on it, this thing was very difficult to push. Despite the decent sized wheels, it did not roll over sidewalk seams or imperfect surfaces well at all. The straps twisted and were difficult to adjust for different sized children, there is nowhere to grab the front of the stroller to lift it over the curb, and the canopy broke. To top it off it is expensive and doesn't come with a drink holder.  The seats are shallow and difficult for children to sit in. But none of this compares to the steering issues.  Day in and day out we had to constantly apologize to people we ran into because the wheels had a mind of their own. Even with only one child in the stroller it was a cause for cursing. I wouldn't wish this stroller on my worst enemy.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Purchased this to replace an aging 42 inch Panasonic Plasma.  The Plasma has been great but this new Vizio is absolutely amazing.  The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I've owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won't be sorry.\r\nUPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a \"pop\" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.\r\nThe second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.\r\nI did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.  We shall see.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.\r\nIt worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.\r\nThe real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"C\u00e9leste is a young French woman living in a small village in France during World War II. German soldiers are living in the village and most of the French residents are not happy with the occupation.  C\u00e9leste\u2019s brother is a member of the French resistance. C\u00e9leste wants to join the cause, however, her brother won\u2019t let her in an effort to keep her safe. However, when her brother is arrested, she feels that she has to join the resistance to help him escape.\r\nYou would think this is enough stress for one character to endure. You\u2019d be wrong. Not only is  C\u00e9leste a member of the resistance, she\u2019s also a young woman in love. With a German officer. Yep, you read that right. While she\u2019s fighting against the Germans, she is also in a secret relationship with one. That\u2019s not all for the twists and turns, but I don\u2019t want to ruin the novel.\r\nI have to admit that I wasn\u2019t too familiar with this part of the war before reading this. I had heard that the German occupation of France was peaceful for the most part. This novel shows how devastating the occupation was to the individuals and families who had to endure it. I found myself cheering on  C\u00e9leste and her compatriots.\r\nThe plot kept me engaged and I found myself rushing through to the end to find out what would happen. Every time I thought poor  C\u00e9leste wouldn\u2019t be able to handle any more, there was yet another hurdle for her to overcome. She didn\u2019t always make the right choice, but she was brave throughout. I admired her determination, overlooked her impetuosity (she\u2019s only 19 at the start of the story), and wanted her to succeed even though the odds were against her. You\u2019ll have to read for yourself to find out if she did. This story shows the true brutality of war, even on the \u201cpeaceful\u201d fronts, and it highlights how brave people can be during such a horrific time in history.","is_deceptive":false}

Comparing with the Brown and Red MX switches I fell in love with the blue switches by testing them out at my local computer store.\r\nPROS:\r\n-blue switches\r\n-fully back-lit\r\n-smooth keys (texture)\r\n-great price\r\n-free shipping\r\n-number pad\r\n-function key\r\n-heavy and sturdy  *THIS IS A PLUS FOR ME*\r\n-hard and durable  * PLUS *\r\nCONS:\r\n-doesn't make me breakfast\r\n-doesn't walk my dog\r\n-doesn't water the plants\r\nOther Thoughts: I absolutely LOVE this keyboard, and although some may find the keys rather loud, I find them very satisfying when typing. I feel my gaming and typing has improved a ten-fold.\r\nA simple warning though for those who don't know how loud MX blue switches are, if you have finger nails, simply tap on your desk or on your computer lightly and the sounds are similar. I knew this when buying.\r\nLast note, the mini usb for power is a bit awkward, and by that I mean I feel I'm scared it will come off if my keyboard somehow flys off my desk, but that will never happen because the rubber pads on the button are stickier than Spiderman's fingers (exaggeration).","is_deceptive":false}

It took me a little time (and extra purchase) to get the @TV connected.  Once I had it connected, I then went to download and install the app on my android phone, which I thought was free.  When I saw the fee for it, I was taken aback.  I \"know\" that before getting the @TV system, that I had read it was free.  I went back onto Amazon and reread everything.  Then I realized the tricky (in my opinion) wordplay where it says free tablet app.  No, they were not lying, but it's a slight bit shady (once again, in my opinion).  So I then paid the money for the app, on top of the extra money I needed to spend to hook up the connectors.  I've used a slingplayer in the past and understand that the system is going to occasionally have some glitches.  I had problems viewing on my phone more often than I did with the old slingplayer I had used.  Since I have it installed and paid for the app, I will continue to use it some on a limited basis I guess.  Hopefully either future app updates or software upgrades to the system will help things run a bit more smoothly.","is_deceptive":false}

They are O-rings with a silicone covered single push tab that pops them open. They are double locked where they meet with a little pin that sinks inside the other side for added security. And the cover and spines allow for sheets to be slipped inside.\r\nThis size is great for meeting notes, project organization, etc. and is easy to carry.\r\nThe inside covers have deep, clear pockets for slipping a page or two but not much more.

{"text":"Easiest screen protector I've ever installed on a smartphone.\r\nThis screen protector is the only one I've ever used that did not have even one bubble once installed on my Samsung S5. THe trick that allowed perfect installation was the solution you mist onto the screen of your phone before application.  You actually put the protector on the screen of your phone while still wet, this allows you to shift it into the perfect position while also working the fluid and bubbles out to the edge easily.  You do this with the included rubber card by pressing it and squeegieing it to the edge of the protector.  At first I was concerned that the protector would not be sticky and stick to the screen of the phone, but once the moistness was squeegied out, it was instantly bonded to the screen of the phone.\r\nNothing scratches the surface of this protector, even when Ive accidently put my phone in my pocket with keys and walked around all day it didn't marr or scratch the protector at all.\r\nSince I've botched the install of many protectors in the past, it is also to be noted that the manufacturer of this screen protector will replace it at no cost if you do make a major mistake when installing it, or if the protector ever starts to peel away from the screen of your smartphone.  All they ask is that you send them the ruined protector.  So for minimal cost I feel protected and probably will not have to buy another protector for this phone ever no matter what happens.  Awesome!\r\nBased on above I will probably never buy a screen protector from a cell phone store again, the price and quality of this screen protector is unmatched compared to the ones Ive paid 5 times for locally, plus the makers of it sound like they really stand behind their product.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have to start off this review by stating THE INSIDE is a nice surprise.  Because of its premise, I wanted it to be good.  I buy movies from pawn shops on a frequent basis, and therefore I\u2019m familiar with what many of them sell.  As I\u2019ve perused the stores, I\u2019ve sometimes wondered if the owners ever find forgotten video tapes inside of video cameras or forgotten DVDs inside of DVD players.  Director Eoin Macken uses this premise and sends the viewer on a nightmarish ride into hell.  The result is a wicked and intense movie experience that is both haunting and satisfying.\r\nI do have to give a warning about this film, however:  most of it is shot in first-person POV from a handheld camera.  Because of this, there are many shaky and dizzying shots.  People who became motion-sick from movies like CLOVERFIELD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will probably want to stay away from this film.\r\nTHE INSIDE is well made overall, and looks great from a production standpoint.  It is actually a hybrid movie, in that it combines found-footage with actual third-person POV shots.  I like this aspect, as it allows you to immerse yourself in what is going on\u2026but it also lets you take a breather every once in a while when the intensity gets too amped up.\r\nAnd speaking of intense, this film does not let up.  It takes a few minutes for the plot to unfold, but when it does, you\u2019d better buckle your seatbelt.  When things start to happen, they move at a shotgun blast pace.  I particularly like how linear everything is; there are no flashbacks or pauses for reflection.  When the proverbial crap hits the fan, the viewer is held spellbound until the credits start to roll.\r\nThe acting in THE INSIDE is very good as well.  I hate to admit I do not recognize any names in the cast list, but I will wager they will definitely do well in future endeavors.  Likewise, the special effects are pretty good, too, although there are not many of them.\r\nIf I were forced to find a flaw with THE INSIDE, I would have to say the lack of explanation for the supernatural aspects disappoints me a bit.  It\u2019s nothing at all that detracts from the film for the most part, however I, personally, would have liked a little more \u2018meat\u2019 in this area.\r\nStill, THE INSIDE is hell of a thrill ride, and horror fans should give this one a look soon.  I will be hosting a giveaway for a DVD copy of this film as well, so be sure and check that out after you finish reading this review.  Otherwise, the film is available now in a variety of formats.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I had purchased another DVD player on amazon but it died and I had to return it. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003ANVQWU?tag=a9000-20  After doing some research I came across this one! Features include the usual gamut plus a very nice speed-control which I've never seen on a DVD player (but then I'm not an aficionado so what do I know ha ha). Simply pressing that particular button on the remote allows one to speed up or slow down playback with FULL sound! Really cool. I'm going to like this button for chick flicks! (Shhh ... you didn't hear me say that!) LoL  It's also half the size of the now-deceased DVD player so I recovered some shelf space as well. Sweet.  I'll update this if there are any untoward events but my experience with Sony gear (going back to before the Walkman) has always been excellent.

{"text":"This is my 9th Soundblaster product, and 12th Creative product.  They have always impressed me until now.  I run audio out via SPDIF to a NAD pre-amp, then to 4 NAD power amps, finishing at mixed brands of in wall speakers and subs throughout the house.  The level of the SPDIF out was weak compared to my previous sound card(s), and required more than twice the amplification.  I am not going to be running my amps full tilt all the time to make up for a weak input signal.  The built in headphone amp is a joke.  Volume level\/power was no better than plugging direct into the laptop's factory soundcard.  No EQ is bundled with this unit, I had to install old Creative software.  Burn option in Creative MediaSource 5 magically disappeared, I consulted customer service, and was told this product does not support MediaSource (MediaSource won't burn unless a qualifying Creative device is connected).  How can YOUR software not support YOUR hardware?!  How does the Creative sound card model I am using have anything to do with transferring files to a CD?!?!  Creative did not respond to further inquires on this compatibility issue.  Sound quality lacks as compared to previous SoundBlasters, it was dull and flat.  Overall sounded poor, through a mix of Klipsch, Polk, Boston Acoustics, and even a single pair of Martin Logan Edges.  Out of no where, a click and pop appeared between tracks in MediaSource.  Said clicks\/pop not present with previous PC\/Soundcard.  I have submitted for a refund.  I am going back to my desktop PC, with a Soundblaster X-Fi Titanium until I figure out a better laptop option.  Considering the Cambridge Audio DacMagic Plus or axing the computer all together for a network media center.  Everyone is entitled to a flop.  Creative proved themselves to me over years of use and many products.  I can get over a single flop.  But not responding to additional inquiries regarding product quality and compatibility issues is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  I have used SoundBlaster exclusively since my 8bit ISA mounted \"Game Blaster\" card purchased from Radio Shack in the late 80's early 90's.  Creative has lost a decades long customer not from product quality, but from poor customer service.  Shame on you, and good riddance.  This was run on: Dell Latitude E6540 Intel Core i7-4810MQ @ 2.8ghz 8Gb RAM Win7 64 bit  Sound card was purchased direct from the Creative website, not through Amazon.  However, Amazon fulfills their orders...  **UPDATE**  Creative has finally responded, and is accepting the return\/refund.  They are NOT paying for shipping.","is_deceptive":false}

I also like the non-sweet ones on hard boiled eggs, potatoes, broccoli,  and anything else I've tried.\r\nI like the idea of the mini jars, as I was surprised at which I didn't love (I thought I'd love the caramel) and which I liked.  The size is also really nice to throw in the kids' backpack for camping trips, as they tend to end up with hard-boiled eggs when they are backpacking, and this little container certainly makes those more appealing too.\r\nI need to figure out a way to use the sweet ones, though.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I had a old Vito from the '80s one child is using and is as good as new minus a little cork on the mouth piece.  Still works and plays nice.  Plastic is in great condition.\r\nAnother child wanted to learn the clarinet so we picked this instrument up.  It works, plays fine.  Good for a student to learn on.  Good price.  The only problem was the mouth piece was not smooth at the top where the reed sits and your mouth touches.  We picked up another mouth piece and that fixed the problem.  Child was able to play without hurting their mouth anymore.\r\nThat said, comparing my old Vito with this instrument really shows the difference in manufacturing practices, for the worse.  The Vitto was a student instrument and it looks so good compared to this brand.  The Vito is easier to play.  You don't need to force as much air through to get a good, clear tone.  The tone of this clarinet is deeper, need to adjust mouth and breath to get be in tune with electric tuner teacher uses.  Not a noticeable problem unless you have another clarinet to compare against.\r\nIf you aren't certain your child will stick with this instrument, go for it.\r\nBeginner, go for it,then upgrade as they advance.  Better instruments do make a difference in sound.","is_deceptive":true}

Because of this, I go through a lot of kitty litter and have tried many brands. For the most part, I am very happy with Cat's Pride Fresh and Light Kitty Litter. While this is only twelve pounds of kitty litter as opposed to the fourteen pounds I usually use, there is more than enough litter for a litter box. The litter is easy to pour and pretty much dust free - I didn't see any dust while I was pouring it. The kitty litter has a nice light scent that isn't overwhelming but does a good job of masking odors - my cats use their litter boxes so much that they can get quite smelly at times but with this kitty litter I don't notice any odor at all. The litter is very easy to scoop up after my cats have done their thing, which is great because my cats do their thing a lot! The one thing I don't like is how much litter is ending up outside the litter box. My cats seem to like this litter so I am thinking it might be too light.

{"text":"I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn't quite for one reason - the buttons.\r\nTo give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room.  To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace.  The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern.  The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room.  So those don't get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes.\r\nSo lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well.  The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED's now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I'm in just fine.  But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don't provide enough light.  That's about the only time I usually turn on the others.\r\nI thought if I had a remote for them, I'd be more likely to use them when needed for other things.\r\nThis is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location.  The others were just too bulky to fit within the \"standard\" box the builders used here for the wall switch.  This is the first that fit, and it didn't even have to be crammed in there.  It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer.\r\nThe wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more.  Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on.\r\nThe remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote.\r\nIt works well.  I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness.  The \"favorite\" raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time,  The remote is responsive and accurate - I've not had any misfires.\r\nNow the reason I took a star off - the buttons.  I really hate the feel of them.  There's a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions.  So it always feels like it's about to come loose or something.  They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges.  The other downside is that there is no \"favorite\" or \"last\" setting for the wall switch itself.  I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that's just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch.  This one doesn't have the same functionality unfortunately.\r\nMy other wishlist item would've been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark.  But the LED's are only on if the light is on.  The whole \"raised icon\" to \"easily find in the dark\" really seems pretty useless to me - if you've already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you've ALREADY found the switch...\r\nApparently the CFL's I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off.  This wouldn't even work with them as a simple on\/off switch.  But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED's, as these were the only cans left that I hadn't swapped to LED yet.\r\nBut as I said, this is the first switch I've tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall.  It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have to laugh at some of these reviews panning the movie's lack of 3D? Did they not read the product description before purchasing? I guess not, so if anyone is interested let me state right up front: This Movie Is Not In 3-D.\r\nI was not looking for 3D, and would've been irritated if I would've have to wear a pair of those red\/blue 3D glasses to watch this movie. In general I find 3D annoying even with today's films, and if there is a 2D option available, I'll usually try to view films in that format. \"Amityville 3-D\" was one of a bunch of 80's flicks that tried to cash in on a resurgence of the 3-D craze; \"Friday the 13th III\", \"Parasite\", \"Comin' at Ya!\", \"Jaws III\" and a few others made a half hearted attempt, but it just failed to catch on. (....of the bunch, the only film worth your while in that group is \"Friday the 13th III\").\r\nI really liked the premise of \"Amityville 3D\", with Tony Roberts plays a reporter, Jack Baxter, who works for a magazine, traveling around and debunking phony psychics and disproving the supernatural. He's not only a skeptic, but actively disbelieves. He is in the middle of a nasty divorce, but still wants to maintain a relationship with his teenage daughter, (and look for Meg Ryan in an early role as one of the teen's friends).Baxter purchases the Amityville house so that he can move out of his cramped apartment, and begin working on writing a book.When bizarre stuff begins happening around his house, his former assistant claims the house is truly haunted, and that there is some bad juju centered around an old well found down in the basement.\r\nThis movie is a bit of a slog to get through. It's not horrible, but it is very slow. There are a few laughs found here and there, the unintentional kind, and there is a cool idea buried here, but the movie just flounders, with the \"action\" coming in the last 10 minutes or so. Only recommended to fanswho want to watch the whole series, otherwise stick with the first two films.","is_deceptive":false}

This briefcase has plenty of storage room and options, the back side has an opening for easy access to store things you need to get at quickly like your glasses, notepad, or a pack of gum. The inside has 2 different storage areas, this is where I carry papers and documents, and my laptop, still plenty of room if you wanted to carry a copy of \"War and Peace\". There is also a 3rd compartment with a storage area that has a zipper to open and close, perfect for anything you would'nt want to slide out like your check book, IPOD, or cell phone. All of these 3 areas are secured by the flap that opens and closes easily. The only thing missing is the smaller individual storage compartments built into the inside, not enough and not large enough to store other items besides pens or business cards.

Contacted the seller after about 4 days to see when they were going to send it out (noticed they hadn't yet.  I received it about 3 days later; earlier then expected.  It came with all the pieces and nothing broke or scratched!  Whoo-hoo, off to a good start!  I'm 5'7 and about 230 lbs.  The chair is very sturdy and I can fit my big rear in it just fine!  The size of the whole vanity is perfect!  I have plenty of room in my mirror to see my face (not too short).  The vanity seems to be well built and I had it put together in about 30-40 minutes all by myself.  The instructions aren't super great as they are just photo's showing what goes where but easy enough to figure it out.  You don't need any tools but I used a hammer to get the plugs in all the way for the mirror.  No big deal.  The shelving has more room then what I imagined.

{"text":"Now these are not audiophile headphones. Not to say they don't sound good. They do. Pros and cons. Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1\/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1\/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again. When playing audiophile quality don't expect them to perform like your speakers (if they are a good set) But you can also expect good quality sound for the price - They do the job.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The \"Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC Super Pro Glow Commercial Pencil Sharpener\" is an impressive pencil sharpener. If Darth Vader had a pencil sharpener, this would be it. I am not sure if there have been any strides made over the centuries, or even the last few years, in the actual sharpness of a pencil. No one as far as I know has stated that they would not have written the same masterpiece if their pencil had not been as sharp as it was after using blah blah blah. But modern technology has allowed some pretty mind boggling advances in how sophisticated the actual sharpening device can be.\r\nThe Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC seems to have covered every single base other than having a small internal camera and external LCD screen to display the tip of your pencil actually being sharpened as you do it. The case is very attractive, and it does boast some real world features that are both thoughtful and handy. These include rubber suction feet to keep the sharpener from moving around while you use it, a rotating guide that allows pencils of various diameters to be smoothly and accurately inserted -- got to have pencil insertion accuracy, a sensor that stops the sharpening when the pencil has reached a fine tip, no over sharpening, removable cutting blades that can be switched out if and when the pencil sharpener starts to falter after the millionth pencil, anti microbial coatings to help protect you from your less hygienic work mates, a nifty blue light, and a very handy and large front removable shavings drawer.\r\nI don't know if my own scribblings will ever live up to the potential of the Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC, but I am ready to find any excuse I can now to use a pencil. Seriously, this is a great pencil sharpener, I can't really imagine how anyone could improve on the ideas and design of this unit. For me it's definitely a keeper. RECOMMENDED.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm almost speechless this product is so good ... wow. Extremely heavy duty, not hard to install at all(*), works like a champ! I purchased two pairs of these, ran them 49\" wide (inside-to-inside) so I could fit a piece of 4' wide plywood on them, spaced them every other joist or 32\" o.c., so spanned a total of 96\", and sure enough, my 8' plywood fit with only breath to spare, but it fit. I will never, I mean never load these things near to their limit, what with the little bit of scrap lumber, plywood, etc I'll put on them. I mean seriously, I was shocked at just how heavy duty these things are, way more than what it looked like in the pics.\r\n(*) Though it has zero to do with the quality or design of these brackets at all, I just have to share that dang, I had a devil of a time finding my joists perfectly, and I consider myself pretty good at that generally. Hopefully you'll have better luck than me but, at least be prepared ... I got so-o frustrated. The biggest issue I had was being on an 8' ladder and reaching to that 12' ceiling of mine, the max reach for that height ladder. Made me dizzy as all get out, which certainly didn't help as I kept thinking I had the joist from my finder, only to poke a small test hole with my drill to find air behind my spot ... whew, long, laborious work. I'm sure it would have been less stressful had I been working with shorter ceiling height.\r\nOh yeah, while I could give you a ton of tiny tips, I'll give you this one - don't use a pencil to mark where to drill your pilot holes, but instead use a small-medium point magic marker. I learned that trick over half way thru and was ticked I hadn't thought of it sooner, for it is very difficult to hold that rod to the ceiling and keep it perfectly still while you mark thru the holes, and swirling that pencil around to mark the spots just begged for that thing to jump all over the place, whereas the marker made a quick dot and was done, and better to boot.\r\nAlong those lines, another tip is, mark only the two holes closest to the vertical pole, take it down and drill those two holes, mount the bracket with those two, then drill the two remaining pilot holes with it attached, finishing by putting the last two screws in those holes. This works great for not only is marking all 4 holes before mounting just asking for 1 to 2 of them to be off and causing you great difficulty, if you do the outside 2 first like I did at first, you'll next find that drilling the closer-in pilot holes after the pole is installed (with first only the outside two screws) is next to impossible for the drill is just too fat to get that close to the pole on those last two. Trust me, you're probably having a tough time visualizing that right now but once you get into it, you'll say to yourself, \"oh, so that's what he was talking about.\"\r\nGood luck, hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine - yea!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.\r\nIt really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.\r\nOkay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.\r\nThis is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.\r\nAlso, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.\r\nThe inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.\r\nAlso the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic \"New Hope\" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.\r\nA couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.\r\nOverall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"The wife and I are big Disney fans. We are retired so we can travel down to ?Walt \/Disney World any time we want from our Northern Illinois home. We also belong to the Disney Vacation Club, so we always have a place to stay and we like to take friends and family down to enjoy the Disney experience with us. One of our vices is trading pins with cast members. We have albums of pins back home which we fill with \"keepers\" when we trade.\r\nPin trading can be very expensive when you buy your traders at the Disney stores - starting at $7 each and higher, you can run into serious money getting a stock of pins for trading. I once tried buying cheap lots of pins on e-bay, but when I got them, they were obvious fakes\/knock-offs. You can tell the fake ones because the edges of the pins are ragged from poor quality molds and the colors are washed out and dull. You can compare the real thing side by side with the same pin that is fake and see the obvious difference. So, that was the one and only time I bought on e-bay. I do not like to trade fake pins and many of the Disney cast members are trained to watch for the fakes. They are the ones who pointed out the difference to us. Some will still trade you for a fake pin (make the customer happy) but I do not like to operate that way.\r\nSo, I am always looking for sources for real pins. These lots caught my eye because of the price - 88-cents each for pins. This is a great buy, and the seller says they are official trading pins. I ended up buying 3 lots because my 2 sisters wanted some for their next trip down and the wife and I are going down in March. So, this was our new stock for trading. The shipment came in 3 boxes. I picked one and sent the other 2 to my sisters to fight over.\r\nOkay - my previous source (not Amazon.com) was selling pins for $1.50 each. A good price and we never found fakes. But the previous supplier also allowed duplicates in lots. Since we used them for trading, that was not a big deal. But we rarely found pins in these lots that we wanted to keep. So, not expecting much difference - other than the price - we opened our box from this supplier (Kerrie's Limited) and boy were we surprised. Not only was each pin different, but there were pins we had never seen before and we have been collecting for a long time. There were some Euro-Disney pins too. We had a great time going through these and picking out \"keepers\" for our own albums and reserving the others for trading.on our next trip. I am glad we bought 100 pins because we took a big chunk of those for keepers and that still left us some for trading. Note: I did find some fake pins but only 3 out of the 100 were faked. With the number of fake pins out there, I can see how the fake ones can infiltrate good lots. I do not fault the seller for a few fake pins as most people would not notice unless you know what to look for. The other 97 pins were great and these are a great value.\r\nMy sisters called excitedly when they received the other 2 boxes. They found the same thing - great pins they had never seen before and lots of keepers for their own albums but still enough left over to take down to Orlando on their next trip. One box had a few fakes in it, but the other one had all original pins.\r\nSo, we are all very happy. I would buy from this vendor again. Great deal!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"What a great game.  I never played the original so I'm coming to this version fresh.  The thing I love about it is that it is something different for the Playstation 3.  The options and different difficulty levels on this game open it up for a lot of replay.  I played through about four times when I originally got the game a year ago.  I've taken time off from it to play some other games and have come back to it having forgotten the strategies I used so it's been fun relearning them.    The graphics are pretty good, I really can't speak to the graphics quality but I enjoy the special effects (the explosions, gun fire, ect).  The art style is appealing but not hyper realistic.      The game has great customization for the soldiers.  Some people care about that type of thing while others don't.  I personally enjoy working to advance my troops up through the ranks and trying to give each his or her own personal appearance.  There is a wide variety of skills to assign but as I remember some are decidedly better than others strategy wise.    If fun and hard turn based games are something you might be interested in I couldn't recommend any game more highly than this one.","is_deceptive":false}

What a cleaver way to manage drops!! You just need to understand how to use it. One tip I can tell you is this: while dropping, try to keep the bottle in a straight vertical position (South direction or 270 degree). Do not tilt it. Do not shake it. Just keep it in this position and patiently wait for the drop to gradually falls. Also, do not hold the baby's mouth until you actually see the drop \"about\" to come off. Practice a few times and you will catch the right timing as when to hold your baby's mouth so the baby won't get frustrated from holding her\/his mouth for longer time.\r\nA great product!!

{"text":"I am assembling a modern, but vintage-looking chatelaine, and I bought this needle case to hang on one of the chains.\r\nAlthough you can indeed use it on a chatelaine, unless it's something you wear on stage and far from the public, it is obvious that is very modern and not nice looking.\r\nThe picture is very misleading: the color is very dark grey (not shiny or silver), and it looks like it is made out of lead - although it is not, and it is very light. But the overall design is chunky.  In my case, the cap and the body of the case are very different colors - the cap is silver looking, but the body is almost black.  Moreover, my case is not very nicely polished in some places, which gives it a rough surface.\r\nOn the whole, it looked out of place among the other things I have in the chatelaine (which are mostly antiquities), so I just took it off. I wear it now in my purse, with a couple of threaded needles in black and white, just in case I need to do an emergency repair.\r\nIt's a good invention if you don't mind the overall aspect.

{"text":"There is no question Citizen and the high quality they have made of their watches over the years. Sadly, though they have faded down a bit because of the Drive 2.0 & 3.0 collections, where they have catered so much on the young, that the appeal of their class has died in the process. But they are trying to make a returning stance in great appeal watches. This WDR Eco-Drive watch is definitely a great return to the appeal Citizen had been known for throughout the years. What I also like about the watch is the excellent illumination on the hands, and the globe-style face on the watch. It definitely stands up very well.

{"text":"This pillow does what I expect.  It keeps my back warm when I recline on it, and keeps my head above water when I use it flat on my back.  It is just the right size to be comfortable under the neck with no straining.  I will say that it is just a tad narrow. It definitely does not span from shoulder to shoulder.  So to protect your back from a freezing cold tub back, you will need to position it very strategically.  Overall, though,  this was a good purchase.  Update 1+ years later: The pillow has developed a few drawbacks over time.    First, it started leaking, which means it constantly fizzles and sputters air out when you're leaning on it.  This can range from insignificant annoyance to major detractor from how relaxing your bath is.  Second, the pillow's exterior is very susceptible to growing bath mold.  If you let this get bad, you will not want to use it in your bath again.  I literally have had pieces of mold flaking off and floating in the tub with me while using this pillow.  I've tried soaking it in a vinegar solution, and I've tried spraying it with anti mildew spray and scrubbing it with a plastic bristle brush.  Nothing seems to keep it clean anymore.  I didn't buy this pillow intending it to have a useful life of only about a year.  But that's about what I got.  After that, you'd better have been cleaning it routinely, because otherwise, it gets *funky*.  Your mileage may vary.","is_deceptive":false}

This looked like a perfect tool to keep track of him.\r\nIt couldn't have been easier to set up! All you have to do is follow the directions in the setup CD. Anyone that complained about having trouble setting it up obviously didn't read\/follow the directions, because it clearly says:\r\n  \"CONNECT CAMERA TO YOUR ROUTER\"!!!\r\nConnecting it to your laptop will not allow it to communicate with the router!\r\nIt took me about 5 minutes to have it up and working.

I'm amazed that the website doesn't charge a subscription fee, it's awesome!\r\nThe 4' power cord is long enough to have it plugged in and set the camera on top of my roll top desk, if you need a longer cord, get a cheap extension cord from Home Depot for $3.\r\nI'm going to be ordering another of these to give me another view of inside my house and one of the night vision cameras to watch the front of my house.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This Sony DSC W370 is light, and small enough to slide into a pocket easily. For people with big hands, you might want to attach a long strap to the camera to prevent dropping it by mistake. The menu system is pretty intuitive for settings. Nevertheless, this's a simple point-and-shoot, not much settings for me to play around. The screen is large and bright enough to see on a moderate sunny day. The small battery is the same as the one used in my Sony DSC-TX10. Be aware, the small battery won't hold too much charge (I learned it from using my Sony DSC-TX10), if you plan to use the camera for a long day, you should get a backup battery. The backup batteries are quite available in Amazon, with pretty good price.\r\nThe built in flash is strong enough to improve the lighting condition for objects in 6 feet range. Time from power-off to photo taking is less than 2 second, which is good for this small camera. The delay between shot is about 1 second if no flash light is used. When flash light is used, you need to wait a little bit longer for charging the flash light, this is pretty typical for camera in this price range.\r\nThe photo quality is just ok as the photo does not seem to be sharp. When shooting indoor where lighting is weak, you can see some grainy photos. The problem is less when shooting outdoor with good lighting.\r\nIn video taking mode, the menu already declares that zooming noise will be captured by the camera. I usually edit my videos, so I can silent the zooming noise from the video clips. Not a big issue to me. When you move your camera around in video mode, the camera adjusts the focus continuously. This is a camera, not a camcorder. So, don't move camera too fast, this gives camera time to adjust focus continuously.\r\nThe panorama mode is just for fun as the panorama photo quality is not very impressive. If you are seriously in creating panorama photos, I recommend to take still shots and create the final panorama photo with photo editing software.\r\nThe 8x lens is a big selling point for such a small point-and-shoot camera. But the image stabilization does not seem to be strong enough. So, you need a very steady hand to take advantage of the 8x lens, otherwise the photo will be blurry.\r\nAll in all, for price under $100, this would be a good buy. For price in the $130 range, there might be better options around.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"When I first purchased this product, I was under the assumption it would be a great teething toy for my 6 month old girl.  The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"The good is that this pairs easily with most bt devices, and as a speakerphone it's quite adequate. It looks pretty nice, though this leads to...\r\nThe not so good is that though this looks iSleek, that emphasis on looks over functionality made them stick the pause button for receiving calls on the back of the speaker. Since it's slanted, this is just silly in every way. Other negatives are that while this sounds ok for voice, for music it's merely fair, and that it's not the heavy duty construction you'd expect at this price.\r\nIt's a decent little speaker-phone\/speaker combo, but 50 is too much for this somewhat flimsy piece of plastic, however shiny. 25 to 30 is what this is really worth, I'd say. And that button on the back must give one pause, as it were, as to whether that feature will make the speakerphone aspect worth pursuing.\r\nAmazing how designers just don't really think things through, or place form over function so often.\r\nIn a world of cheap disposable crap, that crap should at least make perfect sense while it does indeed work.\r\nBluetooth is still a selling point so companies are getting away with overpricing simple bt items.

I find the combination of two soap holders redundant and would have preferred an extra holder for things like toothpaste.  The design is great, with a classical shape and pattern that would fit most bathrooms.\r\nThe material is not metal, but it is thankfully not ceramic either.  Instead, it uses the rugged plastic resin that is common with new sets.  The paint color works well with chrome or nickel fixtures.  Because it is plastic, there is no need for maintenance to avoid rust.  Unfortunately, the pump mechanism is made of a cheap-looking plastic.  I can understand the main components being resin, but using a standard metal pump would have added some class and durability.\r\nOverall, I am very happy with this bath set.

{"text":"I love every second of this buggy, I also brought the bassinet which is from birth, although my son came out of the bassinet just before 4 months he was very safe in the stroller and more happier. I found it was heavy at first and in talking about the first two months but now 4 months down the line it's as light as a feather. I also brought the weather cover which i have to say I have got my knickers in a twist trying to hurry to pop it on before the heavens opened up, it was really easy putting over the bassinet but the stroller I'm only just remembering which way it goes knickers still get twisted but not as bad as before, it's also great the zip lets you peep into baby without getting him wet. I also brought the USB phone charger absolutely love it although you do have to walk a certain speed to get your phone charging. I do have to admit I did brake down the once but that was due to I was unaware in cold weather cases ie. Winter you have to keep the buggy warm and charged at least once a week through mains. Folding the buggy in manual was so easy I did have to check out youtube to know how but one view and I was away with the fairies. I absolutely love this buggy although everyone called me a snob, yes it is expensive I also got called stupid but it's worth it. The lights come high or low I use the low setting when I walk in dull days and the high setting when walking at night. Most normal buggies you have to tilt back to climb a curb, I dont I mean I don't do it on purpose I literally completely forgetting but the front wheels have the ability to climb a curb without the tilting action. I used to think there was a down side to this buggy, the buggy does tilt back if you have shopping on the handle.. I found out through my own experience if you put 2 shopping bags over each cup holder it doesnt tilt back also either milk, formula, pop, canned food... all go into the bag by the wheels where I also keep the weather cover.

The main character, David, complained and complained and I wanted to throw the book at him. His girlfriend was equality annoying and the one time I was excited is when she finally discovered her backbone towards the end.\r\nPersonally, I think it came down to the stylistic choices by the author that I couldn\u2019t get behind. The writing is very spacey and clunky. Most of the story was pure dialogue. I missed the descriptive language and adjectives to make me feel like I\u2019m in the book with the characters.

{"text":"Over the past month, I've had the chance to audition the McCulloch , , and the .  All of them come across to me as being well made, and none of them seem like they are overpriced.  Prior to trying these, I've owned a  for over four years.  The video shows the three McCulloch cleaners side by side, shows the included accessories, and discusses the individual cleaners a bit (sorry it's so long, but there's an outline at the front that shows when each segment is).\r\nI admit that I had high hopes about this model (and the slightly less expensive 1375) before they arrived because they are higher pressure cleaners than the Wagner.  I bought the Wagner to help clean grout in my new tile, but it never did a very good job with it.  I thought the added pressure might be the added boost that I needed.  To cut to the chase - it wasn't.  I might be using these wrong, but they just don't seem to get the grout any cleaner than a wet cloth does.  So, a disappointment for me on the grout, but I still recommend it if you're looking for a steam cleaner for the following reasons.\r\nPros and why I like it:\r\n(*) The steam mop attachment on this (and it's the same on the 1375) is fantastic!  Soooo much better and quieter than the one I've been using on the Wagner.  I think McCulloch did a great job with that.  I'm particularly aware of it because that all I really use the Wagner for anymore, and this model was just an overall better experience. I had stopped using the Wagner and had switched to a regular mop, but I believe that I'll switch back to steaming.  This and the 1385 are just so easy to use, and the tiles seem really clean afterwards\r\n(*) The hole to pour water into is in a recessed area, so you don't have to use a funnel or have perfect aim to avoid a mess.  The shape of the opening serves as its own funnel.  I love that!  It's a big improvement over the Wagner model that I own\r\n(*) Well made.  All of the accessories feel solid and fit well, and the main unit also seems solid\r\n(*) Long power cord\r\n(*) Long extension steam hose\r\n(*) Really good set of included accessories, including a window squeegee and some extra spares not included with the 1375\r\n(*) Fairly high pressure steam with an analog dial showing the pressure\r\n(*) Comfortable handle and trigger\r\n(*) Ability to adjust the steam flow with a dial right on the handle by the trigger\r\n(*) Can wrap up the power cord like on a vacuum cleaner\r\n(*) Extendable handle let's you easily roll it around like one of those roller carry-on luggage bags\r\nWhile it didn't help me with the specific problem (dirty grout) that I was hoping it would, it does a really nice job steam mopping my tile, and it's well made with a good set of accessories.  It's an enormous step up from the Wagner that I bought years ago, that's for sure.  This is the most expensive of the three McCullochs that I tried, and about twice as expensive as the Wagner that I've had for years, but I think it's the best value out of the lot.  The added convenience features, higher pressure steam, and good set of accessories put it at the top.  Recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

This causes it to sometimes not charge when connected to a power source or to not have an accurate indication of how long I have left on the battery.  A few times it has shut off without warning and when I plug it back in, the percentage says 0% when the last time I had looked at the battery left, it was over 50%.  If I look at the battery percentage and estimated time left right when I turn on the computer and keep track of how long I have, then it is alright, but defeats the purpose of having a battery with the ability to tell you when you need to switch to an external power source instead of the battery.  Sometimes it will say 95% left for over an hour which I know cannot be true, it just doesn't know what is actually left.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Ghouls Rule Draculaura\r\nI've been avoiding doing this line of Dolls for awhile now, simply because their outfits are so detailed.  I know the reviews are going to be wordy with all the detail and description needed.  It's now time to put on my big girl boots and just get it over with.\r\nThe basics... Draculaura comes with a stand, hairbrush and a small cardboard card .  A Ghoul's Rule, DVD animation still of Draculaura is on one side. The other side has movie versions of Cleo, Clawdeen, Frankie and Draculaura.\r\nAt first I was resistant of these dolls, since they were a bit expensive and I was using all spare amounts of cash to find the older MH Dolls I wanted to have in my collection. After eying them for months in various stores I finally caved and bought most of the set. Ever the faithful Frankie fan I rarely find another doll prettier, however this Draculaura steals the show in the Ghoul's rule set.\r\nDraculaura wears the dress from the Ghoul's Rule DVD every detail expertly matched.  The dress has a white ruched bodice with off the shoulder sheer black sleeves. The large pink collar of her dress along with the black ribboning is plastic and removable, functioning more like a necklace This enables the dress too go from Gothic couture too regular couture with it's removal.\r\nThe mini skirt of her dress is comprised of three layers. The top most layer is sheer black tulle with a velvet, bat winged, heart design. From the sides and back of black tulle stems a longer train of sheer black fabric, the metallic silver and pink in the spiderweb, vine design, shimmers in the light. The second layer is a shimmering pink that sits atop the third  and final layer of sheen pink.\r\nDraculaura sports sheer hot pink tights that fade to black, mid calf. Her shoes perfectly match her attire, being clear with black spiderweb design and  pink,zipper detailing. The actual heel of her shoe is solid black and looks similar to a fang.\r\nThe wings of Draculaura's outfit are fitted onto her shoulders and like the collar are re-movable. The large bat wings are black  which fades to pink as it gets closer to the tips. A see-through spider web design is cut into the moveable wings. ( Yep, that's right! You can pose the wings to the sides, straight back or somewhere in the middle.)\r\nCounted among her other accessories are a small skullette doll, a pink skullette trick or treat basket and her black and pink masquerade mask. I am happy to report the doll can hold the mask independently and is easily posed with it.\r\nDraculaura's hair is a huge misfire however. The wig is long and full but the tight spiral curls are a mess after getting her un-boxed. Brushing out the curls only makes them frizzy. This is one of the few times I wish Mattel heavily sprayed a doll's wig. This particular Draculaura also only has one single streak of trademark pink rooted  into the black wig The streak accompanies the pink found in her midnight black bangs.\r\nOverall I love this doll! Very happy to have her in my collection. As with any of the deluxe MH dolls. I feel like they are made more for the older MH fans as opposed to the younger ones. The Outfits are very sensitive to play and small pieces can be easily lost or broken.  If you don't have this Draculaura and your a fan of the Character...Pick her up Today!!!","is_deceptive":false}

I couldn't understand how an extended life battery could be sold for $26 when the standard life battery sold for around $90 from Dell.\r\nI understand now.

When she lost some of her homework due to lack of a battery, I was truly in fear for my life.  When she screamed \"this piece of crap battery!\" I knew I had only minutes to live.  I immediately went to the Dell website and ordered the OEM battery.  Yes, it was three times the price and only the \"standard\" battery, but it work.  It slid in perfectly.  No more battery replacement warnings.  No more homework loss.  No more fear for my very existence.\r\nWhile this was an exciting adventure, (after all, seeing ones true mortally forms a lasting impression), it was a truly worthless battery.\r\nNow you may think of this story as somewhat of an exaggeration, but my wife is a native Texan.

{"text":"Let me start my saying that my needs for a Sweeper as a traditional home owner, are simply and realistic.  This unit has just the right amount of power to blow debris, leafs and even mulch. After mowing my lawn, I take this puppy out and have no problem sweeping clippings and other debris off my driveway and various areas around my front and back yards. Wet leaves are a bit tougher and may require you getting really close with the sweeper; if the leaves are wet and stuck to the ground, then you may have to shake them off with your foot first and then sweep them with G-Max.    This tool works uses very little power from the battery, even at full blast;I have the battery powered mower which uses the same battery and even after mowing both my yards, I'm able to use the sweeper on high power without the battery dying on me.    It is light, but depending on which battery is used with it, you will feel a difference in weight, but nothing that will cause fatigue.    It has a power switch and dial. The power switch starts the sweeper and the dial controls the different speeds\/power.  The main nozzle is removable and it also comes with a removable tip, which has a low and high settings, which directs the air at a different angle for a  higher\/lower air flow.    Again, as a home owner, I'm pleased with my purchase. If you are looking for something basic with enough power for  house chores, then look no further, this is it. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy duty sweeper\/blower, then go for the gas models, they have a lot of kick for heavier work loads.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This tv\/monitor has amazing resolutions and picture quality.  However, it doesn't work well out of the box.\r\n1.  Do not use the included HDMI cable.  Do.  Not.  That's the cause of all of the blacking out that the tv has a reputation for.  It's what drove the price down so much from what it started off with.  I've heard that some people have problems with HDMI port 3 (it's the most accessible port, on the left side of the screen) but I switched out the HDMI cable and used that port and I haven't had any problems since.  The HDMI 1.4 is still a regular size HDMI cable.  That's just the speed of the data so if you already have an HDMI cable, use that.  There's no need to buy a new one.  You'll probably be very impressed with the included cable at first because it looks and feels so high-quality.  I couldn't stop oohing and ahhing over it.  However, it's a piece of junk.  Don't even bother unwrapping it.  As a matter of fact, give it to your worst enemy as a gift.\r\n2.  Upgrade the firmware, I've used both the 39\" and 50\" UHD versions.  I switched because I was still having blacking out problems but that stopped after I changed the HDMI cable.  Don't use Seiki's instructions on updating firmware.  Download the firmware on a FAT32 formatted usb stick (any Sandisk one is pre-formatted, you don't need to delete what's already there).  Then put the stick in the USB  port in the tv and turn it on.  Press menu on the remote and 0000.  Then upgrade the firmware.  It could take up to two minutes.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.seiki.com\/support\/downloads.php\r\n3.  Go to this address and download 2 things, the custom resolution program, and the pixel patcher.  http:\/\/www.monitortests.com\/forum\/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU?page=1\r\n4.  Make sure you read all of the notes on that site, particularly in regards to either deleting Geforce Experience (if you have a Geforce card) or turning off some app in Chrome.  I didn't do that at first and itcaused all kinds of problems.\r\n5.  You add and edit resolution in the Nvidia Control Panel or CCC depending on your card but then you apply those resolutions in the regular display dialog box by right clicking on the desktop, going into advanced settings, and list all modes.\r\n5.  Check around for settings that have worked for other people with regards to sharpness, color, etc.  Everyone says turn sharpness to 0.  That's what I have mine on that and I'm satisfied with it.\r\nI will say that the text looks clearer than pre-4k but the computer monitor colors look a little washed out but only when surfing the net.  When watching movies online or playing games, it doesn't appear washed out at all.  Games look amazing on this.  I mostly play games like State of Decay, Fallout, etc.  Plus, some city building games like Civilization.  I notice some very slight mouse lag when using it to surf (not game) but I had previously read about it so I switched to an optical mouse beforehand so it's not a big deal.\r\nI've played everything from 420p to 4k and it always looks great, after the changes mentioned above anyway.  Do not freak out about the quality of the tv until you've done everything mentioned above.\r\nAlso, the stand that it comes with does not work very well for me.  Right now, my setup looks very haphazard with me using an old shelf to support the tv in the front.  Otherwise the tv would be tipping over.  It's just as well though because the tv doesn't give me enough keyboard room for my desk so I now use the shelf as a keyboard shelf.\r\nFor those of you who believe the hype about 4k being better than 3D, it is not.  A TV\/monitor that is both 4k and 3D is better than 3D. 4K, by itself, is just a really high definition tv.  No more, no less.  The images look much cooler, definitely, but are not nearly as surreal as 3D.  I just kept looking at it and thinking about those photos that people have blown up and use as mural size paintings.  That's the effect of 4K to me.\r\nUsing the steps above, I am able to get 4K @ 30, 1440P @ 60, and 1080P @ 120.  Video is upscaled even without using the UHD adapter that Seiki sells.  Supposedly, I should qualify for a free one with the purchase of this tv but I haven't ordered it yet.\r\nBy the way, my setup is a Vishera 6350 FX CPU, 32 GB Ram, and a Geforce GTX 650 (non-ti) graphics card.\r\nI hope this review helps people.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This was a christmas gift for our almost 3yo son from his aunt - He LOVED it - all present opening stopped for about 30 minutes since he simply could not wait for us to get this out of the box so he could play with it - we had to let him play with \u00bd of it b\/c he was so excited!!  It was hands down the best gift this year.  It did take his dad a few minutes to assemble (like 10 minutes maybe) - but once put together it's worked almost flawlessly - my son LOVES using the elevator (& closing the gate every time) - then taking the car over with the crane - & he was able to use all of this entirely on his own after the first time we showed him.\r\nThe only thing about this that could be designed a bit better would be the police car ramp (at the top of the elevator there's a ramp that holds a car - it's designed so when the car in the elevator is released onto the top level that ramp releases the car it's holding - so you end up with the police car chasing the yellow car).  It's a bit of a pain to load - I have to use both hands to keep the release in place (since otherwise the ramp doesn't stay up) - or I have to hold it up while my son puts it in.  This is the only bit he struggle to do on his own (he gets lucky every once in a while though).\r\nThe pull out extension of the road on the bottom level is kinda weird - not sure why it's even necessary & can be a bit uncooperative at times when it comes to getting it back in - but it's not like that has any effect on the overall functionality of this product.  I will admit - I am concerned about how long the crane will last - the spring is quite strong - so when my son pulls it over to the other level it snaps back quite quickly.  Not concerned about it hurting my son - but am concerned that it will eventually crack the molded plastic or something....we'll see.\r\nBut overall we're totally thrilled with this toy - as is my son.  Even we've had fun playing with this thing...it's great.  I imagine there may be some people who get some duds - whenever you involve mass production of molded plastic & a lot of little moving parts, that happens - but fisher price has always been pretty good at providing replacements for us when this has happened (can't speak to this specific product - but if you have trouble with yours I suggest just contacting fisher price - they'll probably send you a new one).  Definitely recommend this for any toddler who loves cars.","is_deceptive":false}

It didn't had such a problem and the thing that you can use videos to record anything you want for free is really something that's worth it.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"Just so you know, Cuisinart said these will be back in stock May 1st and retail again for $39.99. I went to review and saw these on sale for absurd amounts ($200! Really?!?) and just don't want anyone to have regrets. They work okay but we barely use them. Only once or twice. Glad ours was a gift and not something we paid for out of our own pocket. Certainly not worth more than what you would spend for a dedicated, really good waffle maker. These make thin, square waffles and it takes some time to get the batter mix just right and the amount right where it doesn't run all over the darn thing. Most of the time I whip out my waffle maker instead of bothering because if you are just a teensy bit over, it makes a HUGE mess over the sides and in the drain pan. And if the eggs are too big or small or you add too much seltzer or not enough, it can make the batter too thick or too thin and not cook perfectly. Thinner seems better overall though and you'll have to keep checking but try not to over-check because it won't crisp just right. I just bite my tongue at the mess the husband makes when he tries to \"help\" and pour one while I'm getting kiddo started eating the first one (another reason I take my waffle maker out now! Bit tongue does not go well with waffles. Nor does a massive cleaning job!). Haven't tried a mix with it because generally I like to make our own. I would not trust this to evenly cook if you add blueberries and strawberries (let alone chocolate or nuts). The cooker cycles off and on and so parts around the fruit will be raw or other parts burned. And I only use it with white flour, not whole grains (which we more often use) because I don't think it would cook properly. Even though we're in a small condo and it's a hassle to get out, my big old flip waffle maker (another wedding gift) that has an indicator when the waffles are done has a better overall texture, fluffy insides, crispy outside, pure-pleasure type of finish and is worth taking the time to get out even on busy nights when we just want something quick for a different, fun dinner. I tend to prefer thin waffles too, but the waffle maker really does a better job over this even if they are a thick. Cleaning the plates on this in the dishwasher are easy. The rest of the griddler-thing when it spills over, not so much!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a good bow, set at the factory at around 41# and 27\" draw length - with a few caveats. The rest is a rigid piece of plastic - for me it's the first thing to replace (with a good fall away or whisker biscuit, your choice). The 3 pin sight is usable - but this bow does not come with a peep. And a heads up, many of the draw length or weight adjustments will require a bow press and a qualified individual, most in fact. Finally, the quiver is a bit close to the riser, too close to use comfortably with my rest installed - you may wish to get a better one of these. Considering that I can have this set up hunting ready (for me anyway) for a total cost of under 200, I'd say it's worth it, though.","is_deceptive":false}

I told my wife to buy this one because of the good reviews, especially the one from top reviewer RWM.\r\nWe got it and took our usual bunch of vegetables up and besides the softest ones, the Briefton was not capable enough. Just too flimsy and blades not sharp enough.

I was a bit reluctant to purchase this mouse for 2 reasons: (1) my experience with braided cables is that they eventually tangle into series of knotted masses and (2) the mouse buttons have a reported tendancy to stick down, becoming stuck in an active position. After months of heavy use, I can gladly report that neither of these things have yet to happen.\r\nIn terms of feel, I really like the textured surface because it allows for greater friction against the surface of the palm and it generally looks nice as a matt black fininsh. I also like the feel of the mouse scroller; the smoothness of the scroller in action accompanied by the calming blue lights is all quite lovely.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm glad I've owned two of these before buying it through Amazon, because the reviews on here are SCARY. People are talking about it falling on their animals, not dispensing water, leaking, etc. I even thought about not repurchasing, because of them, but then I thought to myself, \"that's crazy. Go with what YOU know.\" So I'm here to share my experience with this bottle.\r\nI have a five-year-old chinchilla living in a five-tiered wire cage with plastic tiers\/bottom. I have the plastic, because he outgrew the curious stage and doesn't nibble\/bite on anything (not power cords, not his cage, mainly just books when he's playing and of course his wooden chews inside his cage). Regardless, when I initially bought this, he WAS chewing on plastic, so I wanted something glass that could hang on his old cage, on the outside (I still hang this on the outside, because he does do a lot of jumping around, and I don't want him dislodging it).\r\nI don't use anything extra to secure the bottle. I use the coil only, and the bottom part rests in-between the wires. It's never once been knocked down. I had the smaller bottle at first, and it DID have issues dispensing water, but I always mark the water line with new bottles and check back within a few hours to see that it's significantly lower, so I knew right away of the issue. The person at Petsmart suggested the bigger bottle. It didn't have this issue. I could see the bubbles immediately when my chinchilla drank.\r\nAfter about a year, it started leaking. I think this is due to me fiddling too much with the pipe that dispenses the later (the part the animal drinks out of and the part that screws in are separate parts). I got a new one. And that's the one I've had ever since. I clean it with a pipe cleaner regularly and a mild soap\/water solution, because the inside of the bottle can get a little gross, even if it's glass. That's precisely the reason I bought him a new bottle. The old one, after a fewyears, was just a little too gross.\r\nAnd this one works fine as well. So here are my suggestions after years of ownership:\r\n1. Buy the big bottle.\r\n2. Still mark the water line with a sharpie or something to see that it goes down.\r\n3. Clean the inside regularly.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased 8 of these on 3\/27\/07 for about 3 bucks each with free shipping but I can't do it again for the current price of nearly 8 bucks. This is a great system and the system will either stack or it can be turned to nest on the one beneath it... which comes in handy if you have some trays that aren't full you can get a few more in the bucket. I read some reviews on these and don't quite get what the complaints are about. I get my 5 gallon buckets from emptying paint or spackle and there's no way I can get enough items into these trays to come anywhere near the weight when these buckets were full of what originally came in it. I have lots of screws & nails but I'd guess that only about 2\/3 of the space in each tray is useable because of the way they're built so I'd say my heaviest bucket maxes out at about 30 pounds. I have about 20 of these trays and another 10 of another kind  so I can have a dedicated bucket for nails, screws, plumbing parts, electrical parts and one for my drip-line watering system parts. If money is no object then I don't think you can do much better than this brand. That said, I'm buying LeatherCraft for about 4 bucks a tray, including shipping, because I'm cheap and it's a decent line though the handles are inferior to the ones on the Bucket Boss. This is, in my opinion, 5-stars all the way. If there's a downside to these it's that the dividers are much thicker than they really need to be and that diminishes the space you have in the tray.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This kangaroo is big and beautiful.  Initially, I was afraid my daughters would be be a little bit scared of it's size (about 3 feet), but they loved her.  They called her Kanga and Roo from the cast of  Winnie the Pooh.  It's sturdy and stiff that it  can stand on it's own, but it's soft enough to be huggable.  The small kangaroo is adorable and something that the kids could take with them to bed.  It fits perfectly in the pouch and stays there while my daughter moves the big mommy kangaroo around.  The fur is smooth and so far no shedding has occurred.  If I am to be critical and look for a negative thing about it, it is that the face is a bit expressionless, some stuffed toys have a 'happy' face, I can't really say that for this one.  With that being said, this is still a well made toy and looks it would last years.  If your child is an animal lover this is definitely a great addition to their collection.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Alright everybody knows what Call of Duty is really about and that is multiplayer. It is Treyarch's bread and butter and it makes people keep coming back for more. Yes there is zombies and campaign but multiplayer caters to most CoD fans out there so this review will be multiplayer biased. I can say that zombies are fun based on experience but I cannot say the same for the campaign for those interested.\r\nThere is a new pick ten system which allows people to build a class catering to their play style. Personally I like this new approach as it allow me to play the way I want without certain in game limits. There is also a new mode called league play which puts players of equal ability next to each other. I really liked this because I would consistently get chopper gunners and high skill steaks in older games and as fun as that sounds to people it got old really fast.  I have been on the receiving end of high skill streaks too and understand that is just as good a reason to quit the game. Now by playing people of similar skill it is a challenge to win and there is a reward to keep playing the game! Additionally people who don't play as often will be placed with similar skill so there will be less frustration!\r\nPeople complain a lot about hit markers and lag but that is not been a problem for me. I've seen the youtube videos and it is often an excuse for bad play. The lag is minimal in this game, if there is lag it boots the host and gets a better connection. I play with best connection on all the time, which may be the solution to the lag issue. Also realize the Cod series has been out for a while and some people are seasoned vets so I recommend league play for new players as they will get matched with other new players looking to learn the ropes of the game.\r\nTreyarch has embraced the competitive community in this game more than ever. I like this mostly because the competitive community is likely to support the game till the end of its run.  I feel as though it is unjust to ignore the competitive community when casual gamers will have likely have moved on 3 months into release. Realize too the result of competitive gaming is a more balanced and clean playing game for everyone.\r\nEven if competitive isn't your fancy there is plenty to keep the casual gamer interested for quite a long time. 2\/4 map packs have been released and zombies has been beefed up quite a bit since world at war. There is so much more to unlock and customize this time around.  Say what you want about the series, but nothing still beats going into a lobby with your friends (virtual or not) and wreaking havoc on the enemy. No other FPS does that better than Call of duty black ops 2 does today.\r\nOverall, campaign is a flop, but the zombies and multiplayer is the by far the best in the franchise.","is_deceptive":false}

This is the one I got: http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B0044FSSMY  These headphones are an excellent value for the money. My son is around 3 and I have always hesitated putting headphones on her when she is on her Fire HD Kids Tablet. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00LOR524M  While this is the feature I wanted, if you are in a very loud area or on a plane that is fairly loud (small ones where you are close to engines), then they don't work the best. He sometimes had a hard time hearing the sound even with these maxed out.  These changed my thinking. I also chose these because they have the reduced volume feature to protect his hearing. I tried these on and had my volume turned all the way up and they were about 75% of the normal max volume. They are also fairly sturdy, I wouldn't be afraid of them breaking unless you actually tried to break them.

{"text":"So to begin with, for our 3 Year anniversary I had bought A very nice ring for my Girlfriend and I knew I was risking something because no offense she is very clumsy and has a great tenancy to lose everything she owns. Well guess what happened? Hmm thats weird she lost her ring the second day she had it, not even 48 hours and gone. The other good part about this situation is that her yard is about 16 acres oh and there is about 2.5 feet of snow. So I am thinking she ran all over her yard that day playing with her dog and how are we ever going to find that thing before her dad snow blows a trail through the yard or mows the lawn in spring\/summer. I got it, its made of metal, I have always wanted a metal detector before, why not? So I am looking on amazon and I don't want to pay out the butt for one and I come across this beast. I saw all of the great reviews and the ridiculously low price-Perfect. I make the order ASAP, wait for it and two days before I get it, Guess what, her dad snow blows. Great... Well when I get it I take it for a spin and test it out, brilliant discrimination features, good sensitivity, and good depth. Awesome, but will I be lucky to find it in one piece? I bring it over there the next day and start searching, I adjust all the features to what I think is good and get to it. She gives me a general Idea of where she thinks she may have lost it about a 50 yard perimeter, I had decided to search a little more outside of It just in case. About 15 min later I am right on the trail her dad made with the snow blower, BEEP. You got to be kidding me, we dig up a chunk of snow about 8in deep set it aside and I check it, BEEP. Wow, I thought could it really be that easy? We break the chunk apart and there it is, YEA! It was right next to the tire track of where the snow blower past through. We were so happy, we found what was special plus the fact that the metal detector already paid for itself as well. It sure did its job and I would highly recommend thisproduct to anyone. I am also looking forward to using it for the hobby later and if something like this happens again, I will know exactly what to do.","is_deceptive":false}

It works well with this: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0008G8G8Y?tag=i60-20  I had originally been turned on to these pens when I had come across an article showing that these Sakura pens had the best chemical, heat, and moisture resistance.  Found here: [...]  Ink stability is tantamount in a notebook for company or personal use. I can write with confidence knowing that my writing won't smear or fade and possibly lead me in a touchy legal situation.  I also really like the fact that the caps STAY on the opposite ends when writing, unlike some pens which don't positively lock on and fall off, eventually being lost.  My only gripe is that I'm often afraid of bending the tips of the smaller diameter pens.  I use these pens at work in labs to document my findings and observations, as well as to draw any intellectual property that may be used in legal disputes. REMEMBER, your word is only as good as your documentation, engineers!  Side note: A lot of the people who use the pens are incorrectly describing the sizes. The pen designation is a #005 and not it's diameter, not .005in, or 0.005mm. That #005 is 0.20mm in diameter, the \"\"#\"\" does not directly correlate to the pen diameter.","is_deceptive":true}

The torque on this drill is obvious when you use it the first time.  this has a dial clutch actuator, so you can choose any torque limit you wish - and the lowest torque setting is a good place to start with small screws! When the drill reaches the torque setting, the drill stops. This drill is well-designed and well-engineered.  It is ideal for tight quarters.\r\nThe LED is bright and illuminates the workspace well.  When maximum torque is achieved the LED changes to red when the drill stops.  Nice feature.\r\nThe advantage of the bare tool is that you don't have to buy additional batteries and chargers.  It does not come in a plastic box - which would have been a nice addition.  It uses the new M-18 batteries.\r\nGreat drill.  Recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I buy these locally, but I wanted to post here and say how good I think these are. That, and mention that you may want to look for them at your local grocer or Target (or wherever you shop). I can get these at either Target or Safeway for between ~$3.50 and $5 for a 5.5-ounce bag depending on the day, and you can check the expiration date when you buy locally. Buying directly from Amazon is a good way to go, though, as I know that they'll make it right if you get a bad batch from them.  Prices fluctuate so much on Amazon, though, that you certainly may find them cheaper here than locally.  There are multiple product pages on Amazon for these chips, so be sure to check around for the best price and bag size for your needs.  If you're like me, you might find a 1-ounce bag to not be quite enough.  :)\r\nI really like the flavor, texture, and size of the Multigrain version (and it's the only one that I've tried, although I've seen some of the others). They have a nice, healthy taste to them - not overly salty or oily, and I love the addition of the seeds. Btw, the seeds aren't obtrusive or make them more difficult to eat. Instead, they just add some nice additional taste to the corn. Although not triangular like a lot of tortilla chips, the shape is still good for dipping into salsa.\r\nI enjoy these chips either with salsa or simply plain. They taste good, and while likely still not a health food :), they sure seem healthier to me than a lot of the regular corn tortilla chips that I get.\r\nTwo big thumbs up from me for the Multigrain. I highly recommend them.","is_deceptive":false}

I have already been to a few such seminars, and of course, a DVD cannot fully replace such a course. On the other hand, if you consider how much of those multi-day seminars I actually apply to my current job right now, the list would certainly be longer for the DVD than for the seminars. I think this is because the negotiation tips on the DVD are very clear and simple. I can easily remember many of the examples and use\/adapt them during my own negotiations.\r\nThe description of the DVD is actually very acurate: A lot of good negotiation tricks in a simple format without much theory of fancy graphics. Instead, everything is explained via examples focussing on how you can reapply them to your situation as fast as possible. So, if you are like me and like this approach, this DVD is perfect for you. If you prefer learning via theory and methods, you are likely better off buying one of the many detailed books available on the market. Or you do both.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"Martin Shaw's reserved homicide expect George Gently is a great foil for the period in history itself, early 60's England, when the Scandals of the Profumo affair and a growing cynicism with authority led to widespread police corruption and clashes between authority and youth. His partner, young John Bacchus, is on the verge of being a bent copper himself, with a penchant for abusing prisoners and cutting corners. Watching George try to keep Bacchus from making the mistakes other officers have made is key to how their relationship develops. The mysteries themselves are puzzlers and quite clever, with lots of red herring suspects and some contemporary undercurrents. A brilliantly written show.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I am a mario party lover! And this game is such a disappointment. The best mario party in my opinion is the N 64 version. This new game takes away some of the fun competitive edge when you all ride in a car together and every time you roll the dice each player moves forward as one, not collecting coins to purchase and steal stars away any more. I like the options to screw over my fellow gamers and this Mario party's only screw you option is if you play bowser party and then who ever plays bowser pretty much gets to screw everyone...which is fun the first time, but after a few rounds the 6 repetitive mini games get old. The only plus is that you can go and play just mini games in the menu and there are definitely some fun new mini games, it's just a bummer that the game boards suck and you don't even get to play mini games after everyone rolls anymore! It's lameeeee","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Having read about the difficulties some had installing this modem I approached installation with trepidation. Setup with Comcast in New Jersey was seamless. I connected the modem directly to my laptop (Ethernet) after attaching the Comcast cable and waited for the setup screen to appear in the Internet Explorer. I entered my account number and phone number, and waited for several minutes while the setup proceeded. When it had completed, I reattached the modem to my router, rebooted the router, and my Comcast telephone service and internet service were working normally except that my internet speed more than doubled. No phone calls and no problems!\r\nUpdate: I returned the old modem to Comcast and shortly thereafter got a call from Comcast advising me to call tech support, which I did. Apparently the web setup is not perfect and after several minutes on the phone they corrected the setup errors and now my internet speed is several times better than previously. It may be advantageous to call Comcast to do the setup rather than attempting the web based service.\r\nUpdate 2: I had more difficulty getting the eight dollars a month taken off of my Comcast bill than the setup of the modem. Comcast has obvious training problems with its employees: one actually told me that it was not possible for me to use my own telephony modem even while I was speaking with them using that very same device! This individual was in the process of transferring me to Comcast telephone support when I hung up in frustration. In addition, the identifying information of the new modem was supposedly not showing on the rep's screen, further increasing my frustration. So, I decided to wait 24 hours and give the Comcast systems time to process my information and then made another call,which lasted all of 2 minutes, and the new rep had my account straightened out.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Was interested in the new Smart Bulbs after reading about them, I was ready to spend $200 when I found these bulbs on browsing through Amazon. The reviews were quite good and said they would be able to do the same as the Hue for 1\/10 the price, I must admit I was a bit skeptical but figured for the price I could give them a try (and at worse purchase the Hue if they broke).\r\nI can say the colors are very bright. The controller is simple and easy to use to change colors. They are great for party or evening dinner to dim the light or change the setting. The one thing I may say- the white light in these bulbs is a bit blue in color, so you may need to keep your normal white lights.\r\nBut for money, I am very happy w\/ my buy- they do everything that is described. I have had these for 3 months now and still no problems. Thank you Torchstar!!!!\r\nMany people reviewing mentioned articles in the New York Times and USA Today, so I decided to use google to take a look. My cousin had purchased similar bulbs and they were very cool. They changed the mood of karaoke party. For the price, I decided to try them and figure at worse I had wasted $20 to try a smart bulb. I have used these for 2 months and can share the following:\r\nThe bulb colors are very bright, particularly the blue color makes a cool mood. When turning off the bulb, it remembers the previous color setting, very smart. The remote is easy to use and all the functions work properly (considering the price I wasn't sure). My favorite feature is mixing colors- always love playing with it to create a new mood. The only thing I may say is these bulbs are more of a toy than a regular light.","is_deceptive":true}

I received this clock on Friday, and I love it!  It is very well made and solid!  It is just the right size for my apartment and the chimes sound wonderful.  I decided on this particular clock because of the Seiko name and the reviews written about it.  It takes one C battery - not the AA that is noted in the description. The battery is included.  I love that you can adjust the volume.  Living in an apartment building I didn't want to annoy the neighbors.  I have it set about 1\/2 way and it is plenty loud for me.  I noticed when I tried putting it below halfway that it didn't chime at all.  It has the option of turning off the chimes at night.  There are also 2 different chime selections.  I have always loved the Westminster chimes so that is what I have mine set at.  I find it quite soothing and my cat isn't annoyed by it either.  I keep the chimes on 24x7 and am a light sleeper - but am not bothered by it at all. It chimes every 15 minutes and chimes out the hours at the top of the hour.  It appears to be keeping great time.  The price is very reasonable too.  I would highly recommend it.  I shot a short video of it and posted it to my FB wall - and have received great comments about it.  One of my friends at work told her husband she wants one for Christmas.  It is an impressive little clock.  It is made in China - but is well made.","is_deceptive":false}

Trimming your facial hair, shaping it separates a good looking man from a mountain man.  However, he doesn't like to trim it himself, so I do it.  This razor makes it a snap.  The regular blades are for the neck and yes gentlemen the hairline.  The smaller trimmer is for trimming those lose hairs, long hairs, side burns, moustahe, and tight spaces.  I absolutely love using this.  When the little blade is out the large one stops working.  You can lock the razor to 'on' so that you can either do quick zip trims without locking the razor on, or you can lock the razor on to shave your whole face.\r\nThe blades are easy to change.

When the drain slows from accumulated hair, I pour white vinegar and baking soda down the drain, wait 15 minutes, run hot water down the drain, and then I use a plunger on top of the drain to create a vacuum and push any leftover clog around the pipe bend, so there's no more obstruction and the tub drains fast.. Between these drain protectors and that cleaning method, I don't have to clean the drain often and I don't have to use toxic products.

{"text":"I've been an Amateur Radio Operator for many years, and have more radios than I'll ever need. But when I see these Baofeng radios for under $50, I can't help myself. I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.\r\nPerformance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.\r\nThis is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.\r\nPros:\r\nPrice!!\r\nVery good audio on TX and RX.\r\nGood battery life.\r\nGood sensitivity and selectivity.\r\nGreat features.\r\nCons:\r\nAs of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.\r\nProgramming cable not included.\r\nVery quirky programming without the cable.\r\nChannel skip is only available using the programming software.\r\nSMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.\r\nVery slow scan speed.","is_deceptive":false}

Needs grip tape, or to be a tiny fob.\r\n* Mouse joystick is touchy, and should be slower with a light touch.\r\n* Limited receiver angle, so it's hard to have set for both sides of the living room, AND from standing vs sitting.\r\n* Would be nice to have a full keyboard on the other side (for a higher price of course).","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5\/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.\r\nThe hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.\r\nOverall, I am pleased with this purchase.\r\nAli Julia review","is_deceptive":false}

The inside of the purse has 2 large sections, separated by a full size zippered pocket center.  There is a zippered pocket on the outside and inside along the shell, and 2 pockets on the opposite inside.  It is genuine leather, and you can tell that as soon as you open the package.

{"text":"This is the 3rd Leatherman I've bought.  The first was a 1st Gen Wave that I broke the pliers, the second was a 2nd Gen Wave that was stolen while in the field, and now the Surge.  To me the 1st Gen Wave is where its at.  The small flathead was the PERFECT size and new one breaks very easily.  The new scissors also does not cut as well and sometimes jams up on the pliers when closing.  Leatherman needs to bring back the 1st Gen Wave.\r\nAnyhow, the Surge is beefier in the hand but still fits in a 9mm mag pouch (how I carry it on my MOLLE chest rig).  The only noticable difference other than the size is that the outer file has been replaced with a beefier scissors that actually cuts instead of bending material.  The inner flathead is wider, the soon-to-be-broken small flathead is still there, and there is a small scraping blade (at least that's what I think it might be).\r\nOne of the things I miss most about my 1st Gen Wave is that with minimal break-in I could open it like a butterfly knife with one hand.  Have some gun oil ready upon opening.  All said, I would highly recommend this tool over the 2nd Gen Wave (but not the 1st Gen Wave).\r\nUPDATE:  Upon removing the sheath from the packaging I noticed a small, thin plastic sheath containing a file blade that can be swapped out with the saw blade.  Interesting.","is_deceptive":false}

Having said that, this is a book review - not a review of Scott Walker - so I've downscaled it to 4 stars based on the book itself.  The book discusses the challenges and controversy of passage of Act 10 in Wisconsin, as well as many other reforms instituted by Walker and the Republican majority in response to a budget crisis in 2010.  The book lags and repeats in spots, but is generally well written and easily read.  His principles and approach are well documented, and his positions as well as prescriptions are well articulated at a macro-level.  The book coveys the palpable tension of the 2011 protests and their aftermath.  As Walker begins to contemplate a run for President in 2016, it is important to be informed - and this book will give you some insights into the man and his methods.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My husband loves home-made pies, so I thought it would be fun to make mini-pies from time to time, just to change things up a little.  After reading the Amazon reviews for various competing mini-pie makers, I ordered this well-reviewed SUNBEAM 4-PIECE PIE MAKER.  Little did I know what it had in store for me!\r\nI followed the booklet's recipe for blueberry mini-pies to the letter.  I lightly oiled the pie cups, preheated the pie maker, used the provided tool to cut top and bottom crusts from Pillsbury ready-made crusts, prepared the filling, used the provided tool to press the bottom crusts into the pie maker, measured 1\/2 cup of filling into each bottom crust, added the top crusts, and clamped the top of the pie maker shut.\r\nThe pie maker began emitting steam, which seemed odd.  After 10 minutes, the pie crusts were done.  However, the pie filling had boiled out onto the pie-maker plates, and a lot of it had spilled down the outside and into the hinges.  Because the pie-maker plates were hot, the filling was busily burning onto the plates.  As I was removing the mini-pies, the bottom of one burst and dropped all its filling.  The final straw was my husband's comment that his intact mini-pie seemed \"kind of filled with air\"!\r\nOh well.  Maybe I should have used one of the booklet's two recipes for pie crusts--although the booklet did say you could use ready-made crusts from the grocery store.  Or maybe I should have crimped the top and bottom crusts together--although the instructions did not say to do this, and the plates look like they will do the crimping when you close the lid.\r\nThe cleanup was such a nightmare, I have no desire to ever use this appliance again.  The mini-pies are cute, but the preparation time is about the same as for a full-sized, double-crust blueberry pie (except that a 9\" pie needs 45 minutes to bake).  Also, the mini-pies don't hold much filling, especially if you have to use less than 1\/2 cup of filling.  I rate this Sunbeam 4-piece pie maker at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","is_deceptive":false}

We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.

Beggin' Strips live up to the name and the picture of the dog in their ad could be and probably is an honest reaction from the Retriever.

The 14 year old cannot hear nor see well; however, do not under any circumstances short change his routine.  The 5 month old already knows most of the routine and expects a Strip as soon as she comes in from her morning walk.  As an aside, we even tried hiding them as during the hiding of Easter Eggs and both of them found the strips in short order.  The elasticity of demand is consistent and they can expect further contributions to their stimulus program.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I was tempted to give only 4 stars but I can't do it. I love this model yacht. I think the price is right for such a significant sized model. It is as large as an oven door or fireplace opening to put it into perspective. The only gripe I have was the size was actually larger than what was displayed on Amazon when I bought it. But this has since been corrected. It is 37\" high WITH the stand...the stand adds 2\" to the height - and you definitely need the stand. I bought it for an indoor window I have in my home and it barely fits...but still awesome.\r\nAssembling the model is a little bit of work. If you are impatient or have really large fingers or hands, this may not be for you. If you like puzzles and want to make an evening out of putting this together, you should go for it. I would suggest pouring a glass of wine or hot tea and make it a date night with your loved one when putting this together!\r\nI used photos from the Amazon.com site on my iPad when assembling the boat. I will upload photos of my completed model to assist others in the future. The iPad app only shows the photos provided by the seller...but if you go to www.amazon.com with a browser, you can see more photos. The model comes with just a single sheet of paper as the instructions. The most important thing is to not allow the rigging lines to become tangled when removing it from the box! It is tempting to pull everything out before reading the assembling instructions but be careful when doing so. The lines have small hooks on them and it is easy to tangle things up.\r\nOverall it is a beautiful display with it's rich, navy colored body and huge sails. It will definitely be the center of attention in whichever room you choose to display.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I looked at a LOT of different knife reviews for the best block set in an good price range. After looking at a lot of products offered and the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, I settled on this set.  Personally, I am very happy with my choice. The knives are very sharp and they do their job well.  The knives are very light in weight but I personally don't feel that has an effect on their performance.  I think if you want anything fancier you would have to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional set, which of course not everyone wants to do.  I am someone who cooks in the kitchen 6 days a week and I have not been disappointed by any of these knives. They meet my needs perfectly fine.  I should note that the block set comes with a couple of extra slots so I purchased the Wusthof Gourment Santoku and vegetable knifes so that the block would be full.  The Santoku knife does not come with this set but it is my favorite knife because it serves many cutting purposes.  Overall I would say I recommend this to anyone looking for good quality knife set but not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I plan to leave a video review tomorrow so that you can see the dress on, how it fits, so how it flows, etc.  For now, however, I will say this...It's amazing, completely worth the money!  This is one of my favorite things I have ever ordered off of amazon.\r\nI ordered this to be a piece of my LARPing wardrobe, and was not sure how it would turn out, since it wasn't sold as a \"costume\" per se.  The fact that it doesn't feel like a costume is what sets it apart from pretty much everything else I have ever bought.  It feels like real clothes probably would have felt back in medieval times, sturdy, solid.  More so than even the real clothes I buy at kohls now!  I love the material, it is not hot or scratchy, it is smooth and cool, but still heavy.  I love the way it fits and the way it hangs and the way it moves with me. The only complaint I have is that i wish the tie was positioned a little higher to hang and tighten right under the breasts.  It is about an inch lower than it feels like it should be, and I have DD's! But I can tie the string really tight while it is pulled up where I want it and I can get it to stay there for a good long while.  I could be a touch smaller, yes, and if there was an option to buy a Small, instead of a S\/M\/L, I would go with that, but on the other hand it is nice that if I wanted to let someone borrow it as a costume, it could fit a variety of sizes, and would be perfect for that.\r\nPersonally I am about 5'2\", 120 lbs, 26\" waist, and it is loose on me, but the drawstring really makes all of the difference.  Also, as I am short, I have to hold up the skirts when I walk, but I don't mind because it kind of fits the style of the time period I am going for.\r\nAlso, if you are considering purchasing this for COSplay, like me, this works great as an under-dress for corsets or bodices!\r\nI hope that helps!  Seriously, this is one of the best COSplay pieces I have ever come across!  It is an excellent buy!  If only Lotus Traders had this dress in other colors in a size small, I would be buying it in red, black, and white, as well...although the green is a great \"woodsy\" green!

{"text":"I will start by saying that I've generally been very happy with this monitor over the year I've owned it. It's the third monitor I purchased, and by far the best.\r\nThe reason I'm only giving 2 stars is because of Motorola's customer service problems. In the last couple months, the power button has stopped working consistently. I sent an email to support@motorolamonitors.com (the address listed on their site), and it bounced back. I tried again a few days later. Again, it bounced back. I called the customer support line. Nobody ever answered.\r\nLeaving aside the question of my broken power button, I find it unsettling that a baby monitor manufacturer doesn't have a functional customer support infrastructure. This is not a mom & pop shop, after all, but a giant multinational corporation. And they don't have a working email address?\r\nThe first monitor I owned was the Angel Care baby sound monitor -- their customer service was the complete opposite. Personal, prompt, helpful. If that monitor had offered video I would have stuck with it forever.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have to give this one 5 stars.  I spent two days looking at similar storage ottomans and decided that this was the smartest purchase.  Unlike others, there were no reviews of strange odors upon unpacking, and it was packaged quite well so there was no shipping damage as I had seen mentioned in the reviews of other ottomans.  Craftsmanship appears to be top notch even though it is one of, if not the least inexpensive ottoman of this size.  I've looked it over quite thoroughly and I can't see a flaw.  As others have mentioned it is dark, almost black in some lighting situations but I feel it is on par with other \"espresso\" colored furniture in my house so I was not surprised with this.  I use daylight balanced incandescent lighting in my house and when all of the lights in my living room are turned on it is rather bright which allows the true espresso color to show.\r\nI also like that it has two, large rectangular interior storage compartments rather than 4 square ones, and that the sides are solid rather than an upholstered over wooden frame like I had seen mentioned in other similar ottoman reviews.\r\nAll in all I'm really satisfied with my purchase.  I feel like I got a quality item for not a lot of money.  If this thing falls apart over time I will update my review accordingly but as of now I'm really happy with it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Had Tivo since 2002 originally with Direct TV. I was an early adopter of DVR. Tivo I thought was an amazing product. I was totally satisfied with my Tivo on Direct TV although I was not able to take advantage of updated software since my box was so old. We finally got a new TV in 2011 (HD) and I needed to upgrade receivers. Of course Direct TV didn't really offer a Tivo option so I was forced to use their DVRs only to find that they were far inferior to Tivo. Lived with it for 1.5  years and decided that we wanted to cut-the-cord and ditch cable. I tested several options (Roku, Apple TV, opensource DVR) and found that Tivo was far superior in technology and functionality. So we decided to move forward with Tivo. The only issue with my Tivo is that fact that I can't take advantage of my Amazon Prime Instant Video. I felt that this was mis-advertised - there was no disclaimer that I saw. Even though its not a deal-breaker, I think it is important for Tivo to develop this capability\/licensing.","is_deceptive":false}

But it made her so gassy that she did not sleep for almost an entire day.\r\nI suggest others to start with one or two bags per day to see if it has any negative side effects on your baby. I know it doesn't happen to everyone, I'm just one of the lucky one's I guess.\r\nI have since switched to taking fenugreek and blessed thistle capsules and I am again producing more milk than ever without any of the side effects the tea gave my daughter -.

{"text":"The price tag maybe high, but u get what you paid for. After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's.\r\nFirst of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere.\r\nI rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go. And again this is my personal opinion, which may or may not be the same for everyone.\r\nWell I can't thank the BOSE customer service enough.

{"text":"This lid is awesome and it also fits the Klean Kanteen mugs.  I'm sorry Hydro Flask, I can't support your logo, but I will always buy your flip-top lids b\/c they are truly leak proof.  Also the gasket comes off if you want it to, so you can periodically soak it in vinegar or whatever to make sure it stays un-moldy.  Edit: I am surprised to read another reviewer describing their experience with the lid breaking quickly.  This is b\/c I put smoothies in my thermos and forget to clean the remainder out right away and the pressure builds as it ferments and I can't screw the cap off.  So then I open the little flip-part and use it as my lever to apply pressure to as I'm screwing the lid open and I always think I'm going to snap it off but I never do.  I've done it a million times.  Of course I'm no muscular powerhouse. But I have to say that I've specifically been impressed by how resistant to breakage that flip top is, given that I am applying pressure directly to its weakest point, the hinge, as I twist.  So take this embarrassing story about my tendency to ferment leftover smoothie as a testimony to the flip lid's strength.  Unless you're one of those guys who accidentally snaps the handles off the washing machine and stuff like that.  In that case, you are simply a danger to plastic and no lid is going to survive the terror of your reign.  Why manufacturers are still designing leaking lids after someone figured out how to make a leak proof one is beyond me.  Only 1\/100 mugs have leak-proof lids.  How does that make any sense?  You can't tell me that the leaky lids are significantly more ergonomic to drink from, or easier on the eyes.  Are you guys just doing this to screw with us?

This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.   Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00K69M0TY  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio\/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In\/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio\/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology.

Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.\r\nReturning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy!

{"text":"First off let me tell you I am a stickler for sound and I know sound. In my business I have to know it very well too. I've been a musician and recording engineer for nearly 25 years. I've mixed and mastered many different compositions in many styles. I've used some of the best equipment and studio monitors out there and have also used headphones of many varieties and qualities. When it comes to mixing tracks it can be extremely tricky. That is why a good recording engineer once a composition is mixed will have you listen to it on the studio monitors, then with headphones. He'll take you to his car and listen to it on his car stereo, on his MP3 player, on his home theater receiver. You then make adjustments to get the basic over-all balance calculating what works with one set of speakers and what does not on another.  So why may you ask would someone who presumable knows sound like I say I do be reviewing a cheap $16 set of headphones. Well I'll explain now. My choice for both recording and preliminary mixing in the studio has come down to headphones. I used many different kinds of headphones in my career and some of the best out there either pushed too much on the low end, mid or hi. I could never find a set that had a good balance of all of them. By chance my cat ate the cables on a set of Sennheiser headphones I once used for just listening to music and gaming and so fourth. So I got my self a pair of JVC \"FLATS\", and I was nailed with major WOW factor. I mean here they were. JVC made a cheap headphone that has a nice crisp clean highs, lovely mid range territory and just enough bass to not feel overly cheated. I eventually decided they were just right for mixing preliminary in the studio too. They work better than many extremely expensive sets I've used. They have a decent magnet, the ear cups cuddle the ears solidly and the sound is nice and close to the ear. The result is pretty accurate mids, very good highs, and acceptable lows. I liked them so much I've own several pairs. I just purchased another pair to add in with other sets of headphones I own of all kinds and values. I still keep going back to these Flats for everything. I also purchased a pair of these JVC HARX300's.  The problem with these JVC HARX300's is that though they are built pretty solidly and look nice, sadly they put out a muddy midrange that does not sound natural, they also bury upper mids and highs miserably. Only the crispest of upper highs can be heard and it is subtle and buried. Bass is full and pretty deep, but even that has an unsatisfying and unnatural sound to it. In fact as best as I can asertain, these may be in my top 10 worst headphones I've ever heard. Which is a total shame because I love JVC's Flats as well as their earbuds and Walkman styles they make,. Most sound better than you'd expect. As it so happens they struck gold with their series of FLATS. They really are both inexpensive and have amazing sound. But sadly these HARX300's just sound plain terrible.  I do know sound well enough to know that if your ears grow accustom to the same headphones they can actually become weaker in connecting with certain frequencies put out by other headphones. I took this into consideration and listened to these for quite awhile as well as other headphones to be sure what I was hearing was what many other people would hear. If you are going to purchase a pair of these, purchase a pair of JVC's FLATS in any of their different colors. Try these first then try the flats. Something tells me you keep the flats and ship these back, which is exactly what I am going to do.  These headphones sadly, really the only way I can say this is to be blunt..... they suck and it's that simple. No offense, but anyone who tells you these have great sound does not know what great sound is on a set of headphones. and they have no idea what they are missing. But it just so happens that I do. I strongly urge you that if you want a bargain set of headphones that have great sound  get the FLATS and pass these up. The flats totally kick ass, these just plain suck.","is_deceptive":false}

I didn't use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn't use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of `cream' and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.

Our daughter grabbed it as soon as it arrived, unpacked and unfolded it, stuffed in some of her clean laundry (she was home from college and brought laundry home to wash...) and packed the bag into her car to take back with her.\r\nThis folded bag is so deceiving -- it truly folds up into a pouch about 11 inches square, and just under 3 inches thick... but it unfolds into a bag that is about 27 inches long, 12 inches wide and about 15 inches deep. Excellent size for a sports or gym bag, or even for carrying two weeks worth of laundry!\r\nBoth the handles and the shoulder strap are easy and comfortable to use, and the zipper is decent quality.\r\nThe Amazon listing states that this duffel bag is covered by the following warranty \"If you are not 100% satisfied with the duffel - Simply Return It For A Full Refund !... which seems to be an outstanding commitment to customer satisfaction. If an issue ever occurs I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this duffel bag gratis from the seller and our daughter put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.\r\nWe found this duffel bag to be better than expected, nicely stylish, affordable and quite roomy. If you are looking for a lightweight bag for your on the go needs, for use as I have described above, then our daughter would recommend giving this bag from BAGO a try based on her experience with it.\r\nVery recommended.\r\nGo for it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My wife got me this watch many years ago. I replaced the battery once I think (numbers started getting, and the band once (yes, you may have to call Timex to find it, but they definitely can supply it at a reasonable price). When the second band wore out, I decided to buy a new one rather than replace the band: the old one was really working fine though some of the markings on the face were beginning to fade and the face itself was slightly scratched.\r\nThe second one is going strong after a couple of years. (I'm no longer wearing it during vigorous exercise as I realized that was a primary factor in causing the bands to wear out: constantly getting it wet with sweat.)\r\nIt's got lots of alarms (I use three different alarms depending on the day of the week; I enable\/disable them as needed), a very serviceable count-down timer, and a solid stopwatch. It also supports multiple time zones, which I use occasionally. I have used it for keeping time while refereeing soccer games: works great. Despite the prominence of the compass points on the face, I've never really used that aspect of it so won't comment on that. It also has a couple of other timers\/features that I don't use; you can hide the unused features so they don't show up as you're toggling through the active ones.\r\nIt's comfortable and is casual-looking which fits my lifestyle (without looking \"cheap\"). The leather is easy on shirt sleeves (compared to the velcro ones: I found that the roughness of the velcro strip tended to fray my shirt cuffs over time). Overall, it's been a great watch for me over a number of years.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Agatha Christie's best known detectives are Poirot and Miss Marple but far from their only ones. The 1983-84 series, Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime followed the adventures of a lesser known detective pair Tommy and Tuppence (played by James Warwick and Francesca Annis).\r\nBefore the series began, an adaptation of the first Tommy and Tuppence novel The Secret Adversary aired as a telefilm and told of the first adventure of Tommy and Tuppence when they met after World War I in need of work and began their careers with an ad in the newspapers and found themselves involved case of international intrigue. The plot was superb with a lot of tricks and an amazing number of red herrings. The cinematography was great for the 1980s with a far better quality than the typical British TV show of the era.\r\nThe cinematography of the main series was more typical of the era which was a definite downgrade. The series finds a married Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency and assuming the pseudonym of the jailed original owner of the Agency, Mr. Blunt while Tuppence pretends to be his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson.  The stories are set in the 1920s  and the producers do a great job creating a period feel, even on a limited budget. Annis carries the show in that regard, looking very much the fashionable 1920s woman in looks as well as her general manner.\r\nThe book upon which the series was based,  was a bit of a tongue in cheek look at popular detective fiction and that feel comes through with several tips of the cap to the great detectives while maintaining a light feel to most stories.  The pacing could be a bit slow with too much melodrama and lead to a resolution that was more than a little bit rushed.  There were some great episodes in the series, but some stinkers as well.  The best episodes in the series are arguably the last two, \"The Case of the Missing Lady\" (from a comedy standpoint) and \"The Cracker\" from adramatic standpoint with \"The House of Lurking Death\" probably the weakest.\r\nIn the end, the series is worth watching because of the delightful performance of Annis and her chemistry with Warwick. While not a great show, like many other programs of bygone days, it will beat most of what's on television these days.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"To be clear, The Science of the Quran is not just a book about science as it is found within the Quran but also presents a background on science and on Islam. Because of this, even readers who have no previous familiarity with this religion or with science will have no trouble following this book. One reason for this is the three-part formatting through which information is presented. The author starts by going over the Quran and some of its main themes, the life of the last prophet, and a bit of Islam's history in part one while including some of the prophet's sayings on a variety of topics. Then the author goes on to cover the nature of science and some science history while presenting some principles upon which he believes make up the structure of science.  I found this middle section of the book (part 2) to be somewhat unnecessary considering that part 3 of the book covers the science as it relates to the Quran with the verse translations and interpretations in the same small section. Also, some sections of this part were very general and self-explanatory to the point where leaving them out wouldn't have taken from the book. However, if you do not have a background in science or don't remember much from your science\/history classes then you may like this section because it is a nice brief review.\r\nThe significance of this book is in part 3 where the author goes over different fields of science and how the Quran contains some of the relatively recent discoveries despite being written over 1400 years ago. For me, this section was eye opening and the author's translation of the Quranic verses shed a new light on their meaning. I speak both arabic and english and the author successfully showed how slight nuances in translation can result in a whole new meaning to verses. Whether you are a muslim or not, scientist or not, everyone has something to learn from this book. You may not reach the same conclusions as the author because they are based on his interpretation of ayaat but you will think about Islam from a new perspective.","is_deceptive":false}

I'm 5'6\" and 130 pounds and I had to really struggle with these. And they are short on me but tugging and pulling at it every now and then takes care of it. I do appreciate HOW flexible the fabric but wish it was better material at the same time. I've never dealt with tights before (only leggings) so I don't know if that's normal.\r\nOverall, I'm still gonna keep them because they look good and I like them but I will have to be careful of the length of my tops and maybe figure out way to not have them be so sheer.\r\nI give them a 3.5","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"We have a small 10'x12' game room for our Xbox 360 and Wii U. Each console is hooked up to a LG 47\" LED TV. The video quality is fantastic but the sound left a lot to be desired. This \"problem\" needed a solution.   I set four simple goals to address this.  1) The system had to sound great. 2) High Wife Acceptance Factor. :) 3) I did not want to run a separate A\/V receiver. I simply don't have the room. 4) I did not want to run wires under the baseboards or carpet.  To achieve these goals I decided to build a complete Sonos Home Theater System, with the new PLAYBAR front and center (literally).  Here are the components I chose for my system:  - Sonos BRIDGE - Sonos PLAYBAR - Sonos SUB - Sonos PLAY:3 (x2 as Surround Speakers)  Let's start with the setup. First thing I did was download the Sonos software for my laptop and hooked up the Wireless BRIDGE to my router. After the software downloaded and installed, getting the BRIDGE recognized by the software was as simple as pressing a button.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Together with \"The Seth Material\", \"Seth speaks\" is the most well-known book featuring Seth starring himself. Apparently, this book pretty much started the New Age channelling craze. Seth is a multi-dimensional, spiritual personality from another plane of existence, who periodically speaks through the mouth of medium Jane Roberts (whom he calls Ruburt).\r\nNow, that sentence should really be in the past tense, since Roberts is deceased, but Seth claims that time doesn't really exist, so I might as well speak in the present tense, wouldn't you agree?\r\nI tend to avoid channelled material, but the few items I somehow managed to sift through were quite different from \"Seth speaks\". This book blends incredibly dense, pseudo-philosophical and boring prose with a strange and much welcome sense of humour. In general, the channelled spirits seem to take themselves far too seriously! Seth makes slips of the tongue (at one point forgetting the number of chapters he has dictated), has a love-hate relationship with cats, claims to have lost his dog somewhere on our planet, and seems fond of beer! He also insists on starting every other sentence with the words \"Now\". At one point he jokingly refers to himself as a ghostwriter...\r\nAs for Seth's message, it's another version of New Age thinking - I sometimes wonder how many versions there might be out there?\r\nGod isn't a person, but an ever-evolving Consciousness, referred to by Seth as All That Is. Time as we know it doesn't exist. An almost infinite number of alternate realities co-exist simultaneously. (In some parallel universe, Seth's dog presumably wasn't taken by the dog-catcher.) Strictly speaking, reincarnation therefore doesn't exist either, since all our \"previous lives\" exist at the same time. We are all multi-dimensional personalities, living on many different planes of existence, constantly evolving in innumerable directions. We are also somehow part of God, who is the ultimate multi-dimensional entity. Weirdly for a system that lacks time, All That Is nevertheless evolves and constantly creates new forms. This is, of course, impossible for us puny mortals to comprehend. Everything that happens to us is created by ourselves. Our consciousness creates our reality, whether good, bad or ugly. Our material world with all its suffering is a mass hallucination. We should all learn and evolve.\r\nSince everything is an illusion suspended in a timeless Now (pun intended), it's difficult to see the point of the exercise. How can you learn and evolve within an illusion where everything exists simultaneously? At various points in \"Seth speaks\", our friend tends to mellow his message somewhat. I have already pointed out that All That Is apparently evolves despite there not being any time, and it would seem that our existence in some sense isn't completely illusory, after all. As for suffering and evil, Seth concedes that suffering doesn't necessarily have to exist, that we suffer due to our unevolved state, and that the point of suffering is to teach us to overcome suffering - a somewhat softer view than that taken by, say, Dolores Cannon (see my previous review on this plane of existence). Still, when it comes to the philosophical points about time, space, matter and consciousness, I would say that a few books by David Ray Griffin might do Seth some good...\r\nSeth also says a few scandalous things about Jesus. Is anyone surprised? Apparently, Jesus was part of a broader personality incarnating as three distinct human beings: John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul. In 2075, Paul will return. This is tantamount to the Second Coming. Seth is unsure about the crucifixion. At one point, he seems to be suggesting that the entire Gospel stories are dramas and dreams, \"real\" on a psychic level but not in any material-historical sense. At another point, he spins a scenario similar to the Muslim one, only more weird. (Of course, the Muslim traditionsabout Jesus are in themselves warped versions of the Gnostic \"laughing saviour\".) Apparently, Jesus got away. Judas deliberately \"betrayed\" the wrong man to the authorities, a poor deluded crackpot who thought he was the Christ and absolutely wanted to be crucified. In drugged condition, this substitute was indeed executed by the Romans. His body was stolen by some of the disciples in the dead of night (hence the empty tomb). The real Jesus then appeared to the disciples, who therefore believed he had been resurrected. In reality, he was still alive and well in his physical body. Ah, what evangelical heresy-hunters could do with this!\r\nDoes Seth really exist? At one point, our ghostwriter comes close to conceding that he doesn't: \"This voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage\". A similarity to other channelled material is the amount of historical references which makes no sense. Seth believes in Atlantis. He expounds at length on an underground civilization called Lumania, whose inhabitants were so fearful and shy that they made up the fierce warrior god Jehovah as a protector. Seth claims to have been a certain 4th century pope, but no such pope is recorded by history. More damningly, Seth claims that a Muslim Arab he once met wavered between faith in Allah and faith in Moses - an absurd proposition. Presumably, Seth or Ruburt have mixed up Allah with Muhammad! But even that is absurd, since Muslims recognize Moses as a prophet. Somebody should send Seth a book by Huston Smith on comparative religion, c\/o Lumania.\r\nPart of my own multi-dimensional personage wants to believe that Seth is a real being and even help him find that poor dog of his (probably a Newfie). The other part feels that Seth is simply a part of Jane Roberts' earthly personality. He doesn't say anything that's *really* out of the ordinary compared to what every other Theosophist, kabbalist or esotericist has already said - except those parts that can be checked and disproved. But then, I suppose followers of Seth could claim that their beloved entity really did get some things completely wrong. In contrast to many other purported spirit guides, Seth is strangely unassuming.\r\nDespite the humour, I can't say \"Seth speaks\" is an easy read. It's repetitive, long-winding and often really boring. But yes, it could be of some interest to scholars of comparative religion or new agey seekers. One sure wonders how the contemporary spiritual scene would have looked like, had more entities like Seth been channelled by the Neo-Theosophical faithful? Imagine a conversation between Seth and Osho!\r\nNow, I'm not sure how to rate \"Seth speaks\", but finally I decided to play it nice and give our dog-loving, beer-sipping and vaguely Islamophobic ghostwriter three and a half stars.","is_deceptive":false}

Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00T56GFTA  Pros + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00T56GFTA  I hope this review was helpful!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I have been searching for a good set of headphones under $100. My first try was with Sony MDRZX600. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B007BY3POQ  I went to Bestbuy set on getting the Sony V55's. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B007BY3PNW Luckily, they head these right next to the V55's. After spending about 15 minutes listening to both, I thought the low's on this one sounded better and the headband had more padding.  They sounded very warm and were great for high's and mids, but the lows were lacking and you needed to listen on full volume for them to sound good. I decided to return them and try the Sennheiser 439 but the volume was too low and that was a deal breaker. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B005N8W1TM  I brought these home http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00S749IQ8 plugged them into my Nexus 7 and I couldn't believe how great they sounded. TI listened to Bob Marley Legends album and these head phones sound incredible. The bass is tight and pronounced, but not muddy like the Dr. Drye's I'm very happy with these and I'm very glad my headphone hunt is over.  In summary, Pros: + Great frequency range with deep, rich bass (5 Hz to to 22,000 Hz) + Very comfortable earpads (more comfy than other more expensive headphones I've tried) + Does not make my ears sweat, even in the summer-- a very pleasant surprise + Vibrant color options\/ slick design + Wires are tangle resistant (although they are \"spaghetti\" style for those who care) + Lightweight, and fairly comfortable even with long use + Aesthetically pleasing + Price is decent + Great sound quality for price  Cons: - Plastic build- not cheap feeling but worth a mention - Sound isolation is average, adequate for cafes\/ dorm rooms but unsuitable for city\/airplane use unless you really crank the volume - Seems to be some some sound leakage at high volumes - Noise reduction, while good for supra-aural headphones, isn't as effective as its circum-aural competitors. This wasn't a big deal to me, but itmay be for some people. - Cord is a bit short (1.2 meters) for some applications (In my case, use with a desktop computer)   All in all I now recommend these to all my friends http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00S749IQ8","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This was supposed to be purchased new and given as a Christmas present. I had moved and did not get to open the box until a few days before Christmas. The power base has rust and mold and other substances inside and all around it (that only God knows what they are), the sets of blades have the same disgusting crust and crud in them!! The two cups are just as disgusting, they are grimy and covered with foreign substances. One of the cups actually is melted and the other is beaten up and scratched. The electrical wire has disgusting dried substances on it as well. They look old and used as if they were part of an antique set. I am thoroughly disgusted with this package. Unfortunately I cannot return it but I will NEVER purchase from the seller again. What specifications allows someone to call these products new? I believe someone needs new glasses to re-evaluate what they are identifying as NEW and selling to customers.

{"text":"I used to buy and play with only brand-new balls.  Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them.  So, now I only use second hand Callaways.  Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That's how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.\r\nThe contraptions works like this:  It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of \"clicks\" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.\r\n-\r\nIt's not the best device:\r\n- It's hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.\r\n- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.\r\n--\r\nIt does work OK:\r\n- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge.\r\n- It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.\r\n----\r\nThe blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.\r\nI do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We've been using the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub 1 TB Media Center for 9 months or so and when it works, it provides a very nice entertainment experience.  The image and sound quality are great, the system plays back almost any file format that you feed it, and, when it can find\/stay connected, playback of media from other devices on our network works well.  We keep our media on a NAS and so the Hub's NAS support was a major determining factor for us, but the support is not very strong.\r\nThe Media Library feature would be fantastic, if it worked. This feature grabs and displays metadata for your media, like screencaps, reviews and cast details from videos, in a browseable interface. It also (supposedly) tracks recently added media and recently viewed\/listened media, to help you more easily access things that are in your heavy rotation.  The few times that system has been able to scan our media (less than 100 GB of movies, approximately 500 GB of music), we've really liked this feature.  The initial library scan takes hours and even if we set the system to not rescan on reboot, it does anyway. We thought maybe we were asking too much for the Library to work with our NAS (although, were disappointed that that might ebe the case), so we copied our media to the Hub's drive.  But even playback of local media is sketchy -- on start-up, the system can take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes before it can find media on _its own drive_. And anytime you switch sources, say from the Hub's hard drive to a network share, the scanning has to be done again for the Library to function.\r\nIf you don't care about any of the advanced features, or the number of clicks and pauses it may take to play back a song or video, the Hub _does_ work as a basic media playback device.  But that's not how Western Digital advertises (or charges for) it.\r\nWe've give the Hub a fair shot -- we're relatively technically adept in my household and we've read manuals and forums and have tried a variety of settings to no avail.  We even tested it beyond the Amazon return window, hoping a charmed combo of settings or a firmware upgrade might fix these issues, but the upgrades seem to center on the addition of new services, like Spotify or MLB.com and we've noticed no improvement in the issues that plague us. That sort of expansion is welcome, but we'd rather the focus was on making the device's basics solid.  We're stuck with the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub, but we don't recommend it.","is_deceptive":false}

They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00UN5Z1BK  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening.

{"text":"If the classic game of Monopoly seemed to take too long, then you will appreciate this newer, shorter version. Instead of B&O Railroad, it is updated with businesses and brands like Spotify, ebay, Intel, Xbox, McDonalds and Coke. Instead of zipping around the board with an iron or a dog, you have a choice of a gold token like a coke bottle, game control, French fries, and motorcycle among others.\r\nYou choose your token, roll the dice and start buying brands, add brands to your tower, and buy and trade and take over brands with empire cards.  First to the top of the tower wins. The game board reminds me of Times Square in appearance a bit.\r\nContents include: 4 towers for up to four players, 6 tokens, 30 billboard tiles, 6 office tiles, 14 chance cards, 14 empire cards, money pack, 2 dice and the game guide.  I like this shorter, express version.  I used to call the classic version Monotony, partially because my brother always beat me at it because I virtuously would save all of my $$$ and he would spend his buying up all of the real estate in the first half of the game.  In the second half, I would just go around the board and pay him rent for hours on end until I ran out of $$$.  Not a good strategy on my part.\r\nI think this new version will be a hit for families who want a quick, fun game for family game night.  It has current, relevant brands which is fun.

{"text":"This watch is an eye catcher.  It's big and beefy and heavy... you know you are wearing a timepiece.  Everyone who noticed my new watch was asking about it and it really sets off a casual outfit.  Pros: Cool composite band - very trendy, but cool black. Skeleton see-through is very detailed and jeweled Waterproof, so no worries in common usage around water.  Cons: Big -- not for tiny man arms. Must wind....  Perhaps I've gotten too used to self winding Clasp can be difficult to open, but it never accidentally pops.  Update 6\/2015 -- I've had this watch for a long time now and it still keeps time and looks like it did on day one.  It's striking -- I get a lot of comments on this watch, much more than any other watch I own.   It really has a great look and complements casual and business casual well. I've had to maintain the band's screws to keep them tight, recently using a threadlock gel to ensure they stay in without risk.  The bezel has zero marks on it and the glass is unscratched.    That's saying a lot -- with its size, it has taken a few impacts catching edges or doorframes.   The Skeleton nature of the face is intricate with its gems and must be what draws people to the face... either way, I don't have its equal on my nightstand and it brings me to looking at some of the Invicta Reserves as a future investment.

{"text":"Unfair is a fascinating read, exposing the inherent flaws that exist in our criminal justice system because of the inherent flaws of those that developed it, those who enforce it, it and those who it is intended to protect; in short, everyone.  The author uses real-life examples, cases, and scientific and psychological experiments to demonstrate just how susceptible our justice system is to human fallibility.  In one of the early chapters, for example, he uses the tragic case of David Rosenbaum, the award-winning New York Times journalist, to highlight how one mistaken assumption (that David was passed out because he was drunk - not because he had been struck and mugged, which was the reality) led to a series of oversights by police and medical professionals.  Once the mistake was realized, it was too late, and David died from head injuries.  However, as soon as his identify was known, as a respected and well -known writer, the biases swung in his favor - the perpetrator was identified, convicted and sentenced harshly.  Reforms to emergency and police procedures were passed in D.C., certainly tied to the victim's prominent and respected social standing.\r\nThe book goes on to make sense of the seemingly irrational nature of false confessions; present the actual differences in \"normal\" and criminal brains; expose the predictability of cheating - from students to prosecutors; explore the unreliable nature of memory; discuss the obvious but oft overlooked fact that judges are humans, too! And the list goes on.\r\nI've never written a book review, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  It is not only fascinating, but an extremely important subject that affects us all.  By educating ourselves about the science that dictates our every single thought and action, we can better understand how our justice system should be designed to ensure it can actually serve its purpose.  The book presents a number of easy first steps - some already being implemented - that can minimize the affect our biases have on the justice system - and also digs deeper, pushing the reader to grapple with the very nature of criminal behavior and how we as a society have been taught to view it.  I would highly recommend this interesting, enjoyable and important book.","is_deceptive":true}

I can't comment on how much (if at all) using this device may make your private network vulnerable to hackers or the NSA, but it is a pretty cool feature. It is compatible with both standard DVDs and BluRay, and also has 3D capability, as well as the ability to play audio-only CDs, if you so desire.

I did not read the instructions and was initially concerned that the razor would not shave that location, but it works well once you know how the razor blade operates.\r\nObviously, these are not cheap disposable razors.  One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  I generally shave 5 - 6 days per week, and can get at least 5 to 6 weeks out of one blade.  I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.\r\nI've used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.

{"text":"** Update October 2014 **    Well after about 14 months of use this phone crapped out. It was not dropped, submerged, or otherwise abused. One evening it just decided to quit. The screen started to flicker and stay on, all buttons became unresponsive, it's dead. Pulled and re installed the battery, same thing. Completely unusable.     As time went on I became less and less satisfied with this phone. It developed tremendous lag with many functions. Sometimes I would tap a name in my contact list and it would take 15 seconds or more to bring up the call screen and complete the call. Beyond that, aps would constantly bomb out. It became a very frustrating phone to use. Honestly, I wasn't all that upset when it died, at least I could look forward to something else. I can no longer recommend this phone based on the entire 14 months of use and it's death.     I found a killer deal on a refurbished LG Optimus Showtime and have been using it for a week. So far I love it. It looks and works like new. Time will tell if it ends up being a clunker like the Ascend.       I did some research on the brand, and discovered Huawei is a Chinese brand, and they are the world's 6th biggest manufacturer of cell phones. They have more market share than HTC, Sony, TCL, Blackberry, and Motorola, only slightly less than LG and ZTE, and 1\/3 that of Apple. By the way, It's pronounced \"WAH-way\" and the 881C is a very nice phone. Don't be scared off by a brand you've never heard of. I am thinking most people will hear of them soon in the USA.    This is my 4th ST phone and my second android. My previous android was a low end LG. The experience with this phone is 3X better than the previous. So far it runs every ap smoothly, Runs Youtube videos without a glitch when signal is 2 bars or more (though there may be some buffering at the beginning). This phone runs on Verizon which is much better and faster in the area where I live, rural Michigan. I should have been on Verizon long ago.    The look and feel of this phone are quality. The 4\" display is beautiful and it's a good blend; big enough screen yet still small enough to fit in a pocket. It feels thin and sleek and not bulky. While I would not claim this to rival an I-phone it does have that look and feel and a similar experience. Compared to an iphone it's 500% cheaper and almost as good in my opinion. No brainer. For the $$ you will be hard pressed to find a better bang.    Do yourself a favor and buy a micro SD card immediately (well under $10). Then go into \"Settings, Storage, Default storage location\" and set the SD card as the default storage location for installed aps. This will prevent you from running out of memory quickly by installing too many aps, as there is not much extra internal memory.    The only area I would appreciate a little more performance is with the battery life. The phone has a 1750 mAh battery, which is big. However, battery performance is just average. Not a deal breaker, if you want a fancy phone with the bells and whistles this is the price you pay. Having a charger in the office or car to top it off is nice to have with this phone.    We shall see how this phone does over time. My LG developed lots of bugs and glitches after a while. So far this phone has exceeded expectations. If you want a great Android on ST through Verizon this phone will not dissapoint. I doubt there currently an ST phone that delivers more bang for the buck","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is not actually the story of Romeo and Juliet, but is rather the story of a group of boys in a military academy and a romance between two of them, told using (mostly, but not entirely) the text of Shakespeare's play. The two lovers are NOT Romeo and Juliet; they are Sam and Glenn, who use the lines of R & J as a way of expressing their thoughts and emotions. The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera, in which the story is expressed through songs which aren't meant to be taken literally (that is, the characters themselves aren't really singing--the actors are singing to express the characters). Here, the actors are using the text of a Shakespeare play to tell a different story. (The ending makes it clear that it is a different story.)\r\nThe actors here are superb, and make the text come alive in a way that I've never experienced before. (And it certainly doesn't hurt that they are SO easy on the eyes!)  Rather than stuffy and\/or wooden delivery in affected British accents, we get line readings that sound like actual live humans speaking to each other.  All of the actors had experience performing Shakespeare, although for some this was their first time doing so professionally.  Hale Appleman is especially good, and should have a very successful career ahead of him.\r\nI saw this at the Reeling film festival in Chicago a few years ago, and it was my very favorite film out of the couple dozen that I saw that year.","is_deceptive":false}

Another man, who is on probation by the mob [Mantegna],  who is a misfit with the mob is given a chance to redeem himself, is to  guard to him in a hotel room  over the weekend for a Monday court trial..\r\nThey agreed to take a  trip to Vegas, where he [Gino] is mistaken to be a Mafia Boss with his bodyguard.

{"text":"REVIEW BY DOWNI:\r\nIt\u2019s always a good day in the Boyter household when an Amazon package arrives, and when this item was delivered and unpacked I did my usual: I jumped into the big box and began to purr. Imagine my surprise when Angie unrolled two big tunnels that had been in the box and left them on the floor for me to explore as well. I sniffed at the dangling toys at the entrance and crawled inside the big tunnel.  It makes a VERY satisfying rustle when I move through it, which is fun, and it has a window in the middle that lets me peek out at the people. I enjoyed exploring the tunnel and then capped off the experience by settling inside for a nice nap.\r\nThe small tunnel didn\u2019t interest me too much, but I\u2019m a BIG cat, and kittens might enjoy it more. I might even let my sister Rikki play with it so that she\u2019ll leave MY BIG tunnel alone.\r\nI get bored with even the best toys after a while, so Angie puts them away until they are likely to pique my interest again. The big tunnel has three hook-and-loop mechanisms to hold the tunnel shut when it is folded, which makes it easy to store, and the little tunnel can be secured shut using the loop on the dangling toy. The tunnels look well-made, and I think we'll have them to play with for a long time.\r\nAll in all, this was that rare Amazon delivery where I\u2019d rate the contents higher than the box. Since the boxes themselves are usually five-star items, in my opinion, these tunnels certainly deserve the highest rating. I am sure discriminating cats in your household will agree!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a very decent liquid stevia product. This means that it is stevia suspended in water. So, it is still a little bit diluted, but 1 drop of this stuff is still just as sweet as 1 teaspoon of sugar. I also like the fact that you can cook with it in addition to putting in with your drinks. Actually, I think that this form works better for cooking than it does in the drinks. In fact, if you primarily use stevia for drinks, this would not be the best thing to use. In that case try this one: .\r\nBe forewarned that this is very concentrated. I would start by only putting in a tiny amount at a time. Then, mix it and take a taste to see. Believe me, a little goes a long way with this! Also, I find that this product does mix and dissolve very well. Plus, you may even find that it helps to boost your mood.","is_deceptive":true}

But it is not a suit where you see it and think maternity. The styling covers any belly bumps, highlights your upper torso and softens attention to your thighs. However, someone in excellent shape could wear this and enjoy it's glamor.  The seller was contacted via email because I purchased it to wear to a party.

This carrier does NOT fit under the seat in front of you, unless you squish it down a little.\r\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I read somewhere that it would fit under the seat in the airplane, and was extremely disappointed when I had to squish it down and cram it in, losing what little precious space was left for my poor yorkie. But really, apart from that, the bag is excellent quality for travel, and I love the olive green color.

Fantastic acting with a fabulous storyline that you can't go wrong with. I rated this an A grade plus for the terrific ideas and full on entertainment that will have you glued to the chair, so what are you waiting for, go on get moving pick up the movie, crab the popcorn so you can settle in for the night in with feet up relaxing, well trying too anyway.

I saw discussions online about how packing cubes really help consolidate your items to make room for more stuff.  So I thought I'd try the Travelwise Cube System.  I just got back from a six-day trip, and I have to say that I am very favorably impressed with the quality and performance of these cubes.  I got waaay more into a carry-on size suitcase than I would have previously believed possible.  I just rolled my clothes, and put them into a cube, stacked in a row just like pencils in a box.  And surprisingly, this method did not result in the clothes coming out badly wrinkled.\r\nThese cubes are extremely well-made.  The seams and the zippers appear to be quite strong, and the materials are high quality.\r\nDefinitely recommended!\r\n(Bonus:  TSA can see exactly what's inside the cube, so your clothes don't get rummaged through during security checks.)","is_deceptive":false}

It has a specialized compartment for laptops, which is good. I like the big look of straps as well. To sum it up, the bag looks good on me.

{"text":"So you'll want something well over 50 gigs to download & install this. Quite a chunk of this \"cleans up\" after install but it comes in like the space hog it is. IMPORTANT do NOT run any files after download, get patch 1.05 and apply it before attempting to run anything. I had no problems with the Amazon side of things, and apart from some space issues the install went fine... registering the software was a bit more... problematic as the game gets tagged in Origins, EA, and Bioware social but in my case trying to launch from local shortcuts made me enter e-mail\/pw for my online account then the reg code then telling me congrads w\/big green play button which goes to we're sorry can't connect and that's it. For a week. Nothing. Yelled help and gave it a little time. Nada. So, after a week with no love from ea I tried something else and in literally 15min I was FINALLY able to boot the bloody thing... which I currently hold such a bad taste in my mouth over I'm gonna set her aside for now and give it a spin when I'm not so strungout over the effort to run the thing than all anticipation has turned to meh... will update when I can more fairly access gameplay.\r\n...\r\nSo I start as a fantasy race female character who quickly ends up in a prima nocta situation from the human nobles, captured via cut scene, and fighting her way out of the dungeons with her cousin. This was immensely satisfying as the humans actions in slaughtering helpless companions left zero moral question to the violence and your party's toons are quickly splattered in the gore of your fallen human foes... HECK YEAH! They got their hook in me... and promptly forgot to set it as the immediate next \"interaction\" has the authorities come to arrest you and your cousin and the HUMAN there to recruit you into the Grey Wardens turns your cousin over taking only you with a stupid argument that your cousin will be safe locked up yet you'd surly be executed if you stay and anyway YOU stepped forward and told the truth (I guess the blood that covered the characters was likely to go unnoticed if I'd just kept quiet) that left me hating the main NPC. There's nothing to express contempt however, you just \"choose\" to cooperate which then results in your going to some town to meet a bunch of HUMANS shortly to be saddled with some silly task to become a Warden that you have to complete with a party of 3 other HUMANS... who you can't kill and who won't leave even when I killed some wounded guy pleading for help in cold blood right in front of them... half the time you have no option in interactions with them but polite ones which prove very frustrating for a character with every reason to hate all humans unconditionally and never, ever work with one. Oops, you can't be that character actually, forgive and forget, it's no big deal, do as your told... it's a story.\r\nI don't like that story so I'm putting it down. It's too frustrating. I suppose I'll try a human noble character one day... Maybe the Grey Wardens will start looking like good guys from that perspective as whatever \"story\" is ruining the illusion of freewill that makes play interesting seems more suited to that protag type and the choices that character might make. They miss the range badly for this type with me at least.\r\nAs far as play mechanics go it's Baldurs Gate spacebar=pause in 3d. it's a pretty thing but it has awkward moments, particularly around pinch-points like doorways, the very points most tactically useful on the maps, really amplifying the fiddly camera. This is easily overlooked in battles your interested in and not easy to overlook in mundane, filler battles where there always seems to be something more to click before the thing will move on.\r\nAlso, by running a game accelerator that shuts down lots of background processes and setting the exe to compatability for xp sp3, as admin, disable themes, desktop, dpi I get a boot in and exit out that just crashes explorer not winblows altogether","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"The JOB 225 is a high-bandwidth, Swiss-made stereo amplifier. It's priced to compete with similarly priced NAD, Rotel, and Parasound offerings, but frankly, it's in a different galaxy from those products.\r\nBefore expressing more praise for this amplifier, however, I have to provide an account of my experience with it. I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.\r\nOnce JOB\/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair\/modification.\r\nThe repaired\/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.\r\nBefore purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.\r\nIn all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.\r\nNOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority.

Maybe it's because dryer hair is lighter and this conditioner hydrates and thickens the way hair feels, but I didn't entirely like that.  I do think Pantene products are generally very good and this one probably is also.  It may be just right for many people.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is my first leather laptop bag, I have only used canvas-type backpacks in the past. I wanted something more professional that I could have during customer visits, and visits with senior management. I initially received the Kenneth Cole messenger bag as a present from my wife, but it did not fit my 15\" laptop, so I replaced it with the 'Show Business' model. I have used this on about 10 business trips over the last 4 months, and take it to and from work on a daily basis. It has held up very well thus far.\r\nPros:\r\n- Very nice construction, shows no signs of detrimental wear after several months of use\r\n- Zippers and clasps are heavy-duty, do not expect them to break down\r\n- Leather quality is very good, wearing nicely, looks very professional\r\n- Fits my laptop, iPad, all cables and chargers, some pens\/business cards, and a few file folders\r\n- Has a separate zippered pocket for important documents or files.\r\nCons:\r\n- Unless the clasps are closed fully, they click very loudly when walking (minor annoyance)\r\n- The bag is difficult to open when on my shoulder due to the curvature of the zippered section. I'm concerned that over several years the curvature of the pocket will cause the fabric near the zipper to fail. This has NOT happened yet, but seems like it could over time.\r\n- There is considerably less space in this bag than my last backpack-type bag. When transitioning, I had to leave a lot of non-essential items out (however, that bag also tipped the scales at 25+ lbs in airports, so it certainly had more than it needed).\r\nOverall, I was considering a 4, but my cons are pretty minor, or are expected, not actual.  I have been very happy with the bag, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent, relatively inexpensive leather laptop bag. It is formal enough for meetings, but casual enough for every day use.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I'm a Clarks shoe lover and own three other pairs. These shoes offered me comfort, were less strain in on the legs and back after standing and walking for 8-10 hours. No break in time and wore them straight out the box. I have been looking at these shoes for three months before I bought them. I've also tried the Merrell's and New Balance line. Found these very stiff and hard on my feet. I normally wear an 8w in all my shoes. I went up a half size in these to accommodate thick socks or if you wear two pairs of socks like I do: for extra cushioning and perspiration. The width is true to size. It will also accommodate your orthotics. I recommend these shoes if you are into walking, standing at great lengths during the day. I did Disneyland, LA, CA,  all three days in these shoes with no problems whatsoever.","is_deceptive":false}

If you are looking for timex take a lick and keep on ticking quality then keep in mind the price you are paying... It is a little cheaper made than other watches, but also costs far less than other watches. Shipping was not that bad either.. I had mine within two weeks. Not sure if it ships from overseas but I do know that if it does than this is great timing, since overseas shipping usually take 3-4 weeks where I live, and in my opinion shipping time is more than except-able..

{"text":"If you already got the first set to this entertaining and addictive series then the second half is a must, as we see the confrontation build up between self made enemies and greedy conglomerates.  What amazed me was how much I grew to enjoy the series as I watched it more and more throughout the series story, it gives a nice abundance of action,comedy,drama,heartache,tragedy and a touch of romance.  Also the array of endearing cast of characters also made the series very enjoyable throughout the show, as you come to care for some and dislike others which in itself is what makes a great series when you endear yourself to the characters and villains alike.  The animation felt a little reminiscent of a couple of other series Last Exile and Eureka Seven so if you've seen either one you might sense a case of deja vu when you watch the series,also the voice cast did a terrific job in their character roles both for the dubbed and subbed.  The extras aren't much at most just the usual trailers and textless intro\/ending songs,  if you already got the first set then you've seen that the case box is just hardened cardboard to fit the two part series dvd cases into which while looking nice isn't anything really special except to a hardcore anime collector fan.  If you're looking for an intriguing series with a entertaining cast and decent storyline here's one worth looking into though still a little pricier then past Funimation sets it's still worth checking out.","is_deceptive":false}

There were several other holes in the main box. There were a couple of other boxes inside the main box and they didn't look much better.\r\nNow moving on to the actual product. First of all, it's made in china and it showed in mine. The black metal had scrapes on it in multiple places. Some pieces were worse than others. 2 of the 5 glass pieces had scratches. One was very noticeable. The glass is attached to the desk by several suction cups. The product was also covered in little shaving that another reviewer said was fiberglass strands. Not sure if that's exactly what they were, but my product was covered in them.\r\nI really wanted to like this desk because it looks nice.

{"text":"I bought the MX4500 for the occasional storm outage.  My considerations were: noise, wattage, run-time, weight, cost.  I wanted to run my well pump, two refrigerators, and a propane furnace (i.e. blower).  While I can't run everything at the same time, I was able to hook up quite a bit more by also buying a transfer switch.  I STRONGLY recommend the transfer switch for safety and a more practical use of the generator.  It allows me (or my wife) to easily hookup the generator and turn circuits on\/off (upto 10 circuits for our switch) based on maximum wattage.\r\nNoise: after trying to sleep with the noise from the neighbor's generator running several hundred feet away, I wanted something quiter. The MX4500 is reasonable (similar to a small pushmower).  From inside the house, I am not aware of the unit running.\r\nWeight: I wanted something me and my wife could carry (or load in the trunk of the car) if necessary.  While it's not light, we were able to carry it together.  By storing it in the garage, my wife can easily roll it to where the transfer box plug is on the side of the house, hook it up and start it (without my help!).\r\nWattage: of all circuits, my 1\/2 HP well pump draws the highest wattage at a MAX of 3000W startup surge (according to the manufacturer). Once the pump is running, it only draws about 1000W.  Once the water pressure tank is filled, of course there is no draw.  With that in mind, a transfer switch allows me to easily turn the well pump on and off when I need it; e.g. to take a shower or refill the pressure tank.  While the well pump is turned on, I don't use any power hungry devices.  Beware of surge wattage - the refrigerators surge when they start, the furnace blower surges etc.  During the last outage: I ran the well pump when needed, cooked dinner in the microwave, then ran a room air conditioner with several rooms of lighting and the refrigerators.  This was the only time so far I have run the unit for an extendedperiod of time.  If I recall correctly, it ran for 7 to 8 hours on one tank.\r\nIf noise, weight and cost were not considerations, I would have bought an 8,000 Watt generator to run everything without having to switch things on and off.  With the transfer switch already in place, I could easily do that at a future time.  Considering how rarely we lose power, the price point of this unit was just right.\r\nAdditional comment about the transfer switch, I was a little apprehensive of installing the transfer switch on my own, but it was fairly easy.  I read the instructions carefully before hand and then took a few hours for the install.  The model is a Reliance Pro\/Tran 10 circuit 30 amp switch.  (It included the cable to hookup to the generator, the outdoor connection box etc.)\r\nI haven't had the unit for very long and have only started it 4 or 5 times.  Each time, it started on the first or second pull.  As with most engines that sit for a long time (snowblower etc), I turn the gas valve off and let the gas run out before storing the unit.  With how infrequent I expect to use this, I also use gas stabilizer.\r\nOverall, I am very happy with this generator.  It does exactly what I needed at a very reasonable cost.","is_deceptive":false}

Yes, it does get a little hot with continuous use as other reviewers stated before.\r\nI bought mine in October 2013, and it does remove HDCP protection (tested with a PS3) which is the main reason you might be taking a look at this item.\r\nIt is quite small and \"portable\" (sans the power supply) so you would have no problem hiding it.\r\nThe main issue with my unit (perhaps defective?) is that the sound will either crack or just be gone completely. I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card () or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture.\r\nOverall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).\r\nI haven't had the chance to try 3D yet to see if it works, maybe when I do I'll come back and update the review.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I have to admit that the design of this trunk mount rack is at least interesting. First time, I just couldn't believe that it is able to hold 2 bikes.

Unfortunately, some effort is required...because my wife wouldn't be able to mount them by herself.\r\nThe straps are a bit insecure.

It does not replicate pitching like a pitching machine but it does a fair job of reproducing soft toss with several variations built in. Overall this is bigger than it looks in the picture. The tubes have a disconcerting way of coming loose now and then, and the height adjustment knob should not be made of this kind of flimsy plastic, but otherwise it works as advertised. The dispensing of the ball onto the rebound net offers some element of unpredictability as the ball does not always bounce up to the same extent and direction. I suppose that is good. It is hard to draw a correlation from a scientific viewpoint but my kid has been using this for two weeks and the last few games have been a bit more productive for him after being on the machine. He has hit some pretty good line drives lately. I would like to think it is extra practice afforded by this machine, but the verdict is still out. All in all, a usable product.","is_deceptive":false}

The Sony TV and Time-Warner cable box codes were accepted on first try.  Then it was time to add the Sony DVD player, and the instruction sheet offered 8 codes. I went through the first seven with exponentially diminishing hopes--until I was down to a barely flickering futile flame.  Wouldn't you know--#8 was the right code!  Proof there's a god after all!  (All the same, if none of the numbers works, there's another form of entry to try called \"Code Search.\")\r\nLesson learned. Never give up--never.  But if you're struggling with this inexpensive gadget for more than 20 minutes, don't hesitate to toss it.  Life is too short--and the distance between me and my TV isn't really that long.  Moreover, there's no way to store favorite channels--even a mere several. That wouldn't be a problem were it not for Time-Warner's 2000-channel line-up (and of course the HD channels are all up in the 4-digit zone).\r\nAnyway, this $5 toy is a potentially useful \"spare.\"  (Don't lose the instruction sheet!)\r\n[The price has gone down even more!

The battery could last up to 14 days and the on\/off timer setting is great.

After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more \"smooth\" feeling while running.

{"text":"The 2013 Asus Nexus 7 is absolutely awesome when it works.\r\nUnfortunately, it is also very fragile. I bought one right before a trip and was loving it until 2\/3 of the digitizer went intermittent then quit working. After looking at it under various lighting conditions while it was off, I could see a hair line crack in the display\/digitzer stack. The fracture was not visible with the display on. You could not feel it on the surface. The digitizer worked on the narrow side of the crack and not on the other two thirds of the screen.\r\nThis device is too fragile. The chassis flexes easily and I believe this is what allows the display to flex enough to break the digitizer. I feel like this product is going to have major issues because it is small enough to fit in a pocket like a large cell phone and based on the amount of flex in the chassis, this is the kiss of death for a nexus 7. For anyone considering buying a 2013 Nexus 7, put it in a nice fat rigid case immediately and never, never subject it to any flex.\r\nI think Asus should take a look at an a Samsung note 2. I have carried one for a year and not been nearly as careful, and it is holding up fine, granted it is smaller, but the 2013 nexus 7 lasted 3 days and the repair cost (165.00 for a screen that you install) The repair cost is too expensive to make sense and turns an awesome device into land fill fodder. What sucks is that I feel responsible for breaking it although it was never dropped or handled roughly, and from the posts around the web, I can tell that it is a waste of time to try to get Asus to stand behind their product even though it is three days old.\r\nAs much as I hate to sound like a Apple fan boy, at least you can fix an ipad digitizer for 30 bucks if you are willing to burn an hour or two. Asus, it is going to very difficult to convince myself to carry another 2013 Nexus 7. I expect it to work when I turn it on....","is_deceptive":false}

The flavor is not overwhelming with the taste of Hazelnut and that is good because some products out there (mostly creamers) can be overwhelming if you add it to coffee.  Maxwell House did good by the nice flavor but also you can taste the rich coffee as well.  I am very pleased that over the years Maxwell House has improved the flavor and the varities of their International Coffees.  In the 1970's and 1980's, there were only a few flavors of International Coffee and they also tasted very weak.  Well, they are now a pleasure to purchase due to the wide variety of flavors and the richness of the coffee's they sell.  Hazelnut is great to enjoy during the morning or whenever you want a good tasting coffee during the day or night.  Highly Recommended!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased this in December and we have gotten a lot of use out of these DVD players! I recently purchased a longer AV cable because the way we configured it in the car with one player in the second row and one in the back we needed a longer cable to be able to tuck it away and not have to trip over the cord whenever the kiddos got in and out of the car. With that adjustment it works beautifully. Everything as far as the players are concerned has been working great until this last car trip one of the player's doors will not latch securely so at the slightest jar or bump it will flash \"open\" on the screen and stop playing. This is not a huge deal since we always watch with them connected anyway it just required a simple DVD swap. Like I said we use them a lot and I have four little girls under the age of 7 with access to the buttons so I'm not blaming the machine. The video quality is perfect for what we use them for, the sound is great, maybe a little too great we usually turn off the sound on the player mounted behind the driver's head and leave the other one on so my husband and I can have a conversation in the car. I am not in love with the buttons to control play and pause and skipping chapters, they are very small and it is very easy to push the wrong one and start rewinding instead of playing. As long as I set the whole movie up before we head out it is usually no big deal but as far as controlling the units themselves it's too tricky for the four year olds who are the main DVD player controllers. All in all if you are debating about purchasing this item I did some serious homework on it and am very satisfied with this purchase. When these die (eventually) I would buy a second set in a minute.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I saw this movie nearly two years ago and have watched 150+ movies since, yet it haunts me with its beauty.  It was playing at a film festival that I attend annually and was my favorite out of more than 25 movies I caught that year.  First off, this movie was especially well written.  If you are tired of the regurgitated swill that Hollywood increasingly produces this will definitely appeal to you.  As you watch the movie, the characters are well developed and honest.  They could be your neighbor or a friend.  The acting was exceptional and believable as an elderly man slowly loses his ability to connect with the world around him.  But beware -things are never what they appear on the surface.  If you like a good love story that doesn't need sex and violence to \"enhance\" your enjoyment, this qualifies as an experience to be savored.  The plot line is well developed but provides a surprise that few will foresee.  Furthermore, several of my movie friend's stated that when watching it a second time, you catch greater subtleties within the premise of the movie and that they actually enjoyed it even more.  What could be a greater endorsement from serious movie aficionados?!  It's a definite must see, in fact, I enjoyed this as much as \"Love Story\".  Oh and don't forget to bring some tissues!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've got a lot of laptop cases, backpacks, and messenger bags that I've gone through looking for something ideal for various situations.  I liked the looks of this one, so thought I'd give it a try.\r\nI'm in the IT field, so I carry a lot of things around - external USB drives, thumb drives, power cord, external Blu ray \/ DVD drive, adapters, portable firewalls and wireless units, just a bunch of things.  So I'm more picky than most about bags.\r\nThe colors on this are really great.  I love the way it looks, vibrant and bright with the greens, and the deep blue looks good as well.  There is padding not just on the straps, but on the back panel as well to protect your back and a laptop.  Unlike some that I've had, this one actually has a little bit of padding on the bottom of the laptop's sleeve as well.  That's a pet peeve of mine in laptop backpacks - when they don't have padding *where you set them down* all the time.\r\nI like the handle on top - some others I have just have smaller nylon straps as quick grab handles.  This one isn't very thick, but it works well.\r\nThe downside for me is that there just aren't as many storage spots in here as I'd like.  Just the laptop sleeve in the rear most opening.  No pockets at all in the middle compartment.  And just two pockets, one zipper opening, and the tablet spot in the front opening.  Then there is the small zippered pouch on the top.  That's it.  Other than that one zipper comparement, the only thing that secures anything is the velcro strap for the laptop compartment.\r\nSo for my use, it's too limited.  But for a student or someone with simpler needs, it really is a nice backpack.  It's comfortable, and those open spaces are great for books, change of clothes, or other things like that.  And I like that it has water bottle spots on both sides, since I like to carry some bottles of Lipton Iced Tea, and two is always better than one.\r\nThe one odd thing missing isa small opening to feed earbuds or something through, so if you're a person who wants that, you'll need to settle for snaking the cord out through an opening in the zipper instead.\r\nGood backpack for the price.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In Woody Allen's 2014 annual European set film, he goes back in time to the Roaring `20's.  Colin Firth plays Stanley Crawford who is a famous magician who goes by the name and disguise of Wei Ling Soo.  Stanley is approached by his good friend and fellow magician, Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to go to England and help him expose a supposed medium who he believes is hoodwinking the wealthy Catledge family into investing a fortune into an organization that promotes supernatural contact with the deceased.\r\nStanley agrees, but like Howard, has a hard time finding the secrets.  In fact, he becomes convinced that the young American, Sophie (Emma Stone) is the real deal after she advances secrets about himself.  Marcia Gay Harden plays Sophie's mother, but really doesn't have much to do.  Jacki Weaver plays Grace Catledge, the widow who is trying to contact her late husband.  Hamish Linklater plays Brice Catledge, the playboy son who is smitten with Sophie and courts her with song and ukulele.\r\nThis is lightweight stuff to be sure, but Allen offers a fine script and compelling characters to make it enjoyable.  Some of the best scenes are with Stanley and his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins) who lives near the Catledge's.  In one particular scene, Stanley argues with himself as to whether he should pursue Sophie.  Vanessa provides one liners that bounce back Stanley's own arguments.  It's funny and sweet.  Granted, we know all is not what it seems but I won't spoil the Agatha Christie-like reveal.  To be sure, this isn't one of Allen's masterpieces or even one of his best.  But I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially to Allen's fans.\r\nThe Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The technicians do a serviceable job transferring the film to the digital format.  The filmmakers chose a light hazy, sepia tone to the picture and it is nicely replicated here.  Close-ups are particularly good with fine detail and excellent skin tones consistent with the overall limitations.  Black levels are generally good.  Light grain can be seen throughout.  I was a little surprised to see a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track with this movie.  I seem to remember Allen almost always goes with stereo.  In any case the audio is very good, although the surrounds are mostly in play with the musical score and an early scene when Sophie and Stanley get caught in a thunderstorm.  The dialog centric movie is very clear with most of the audio coming from the center speaker.  The package includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include a piece called \"Behind the Magic\" and another \"On the Red Carpet\" as well as a trailer.","is_deceptive":false}

I'd rather have it compact and be without this.\r\nLeather is not stiff enough to provide the retention of a more expensive holster, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was, but it is worth mentioning that for double the money you would be able to hang upside down and still retain the pistol. You can not do that with this model.\r\nPro:\r\nThe leather is above average quality as far as this price range. Stitching is High Quality and to the par I would use making my own holster of this variety.\r\nComfortable and compact to wear\r\nStitching around the belt slots will keep the holster in better working condition.\r\nAll that I would likely buy an second one if I was in a pinch for a quick holster.","is_deceptive":false}

I had mechanically inclined people assemble it for me so I can't speak to the difficulty involved with that.\r\nThe slab your mattress sits on is not one piece.  It is four pieces of particle board that are held together by metal plates and screws.  These four pieces may not line up well leaving jagged edges on the side of your bed.\r\nWithin two weeks of use, the support beams (made out of particle board) broke.  Both myself and the other person who sleep on this bed have normal BMI and together weigh less than 300lb.  This is a quality issue.  We went to the hardware store and bought solid wood 2x3inch thick support beams.  We took the bed apart to replace the particle board beams with solid wood ones.  6 weeks into using this product, now the screws for this come loose easily and the bed creaks loudly with little human movement (back to side).\r\nI paid about $120 for this.

I actually like those songs better than Baby One More Time. As mushy and corny those songs can be, I did enjoyed the sweet sentiment of those songs. I think after she broke up with Justin, you could definitely see the changes in her personality and behavior. She started doing really stupid things, but I guess she kinda wise up from her mistakes now that she's older. I think this DVD is good for people who are just starting to like Britney and her music, and for people who are generally feeling nostalgic about their school days in the 90s and the bubblegum pop era.","is_deceptive":false}

I chose the smaller rug 3'3\" by 4'3\" and after unrolling it I had trouble with the edges wanting to curl in because it was rolled up. I don't know how to fix the side that was the interior part of the \"roll\". It's crinkled for about a foot of the 3'3\" side. Hopefully, in a few days it will flatten out but with the quality of the rug being on the cheaper side it may not. The colors are great, it's definitely a cheaper shag, but maybe packaging is what's getting me here. Honestly, it's a good buy but I would recommend getting a 4x6 so it's not so crinkled or folded.

One clip kept popping off the bracelet, and after a few times refused to stay closed any longer. The other clip was just too tight around the thread and I was afraid that it would twist and break the bracelet, since the bead didn't rotate as the bracelet rolled along my arm.\r\nEven though they don't really fit as intended, they still would work as regular beads or an end lock on a Pandora (placed just before the end thread so that the other beads don't fall off) or any other brand 3mm bracelet.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"(This is for the Double Choco Espresso variety.)\r\nYears ago, I bought and really enjoyed the  squares.  I'd read some reviews that the bars were smaller, more expensive, and not as good now that Earnest took over, but I decided to give them a try.\r\nMaybe I went with the wrong variety, but the Double Choco Espresso squares that I received are really dry.  Not crunchy and stale, mind you, but \"moist\" isn't a word that would even remotely enter your mind upon taking a bite, unless is was prefaced by \"wow, these sure aren't.\"  It's like being in a real life \"Got Milk\" commercial.  The flavor is okay (not great, but okay), but the dryness is really off putting, and they are quite small.\r\nGiven the current price of over $1\/bar for these (and over $1.50 for some of them), I'd recommend passing.  For a while now, I've been eating  (I've tried and liked the fig and raspberry flavors).  For similar calorie count with less fat and about half the price of these, I suggest giving those a try if you're looking for an easily packed snack.","is_deceptive":false}

It will go only as fast as you pedal so she likes how she can take it slow while watching tv, to improve circulation in her legs.  However, if you are a young healthy person looking for a cardio workout in confined space \/ on the cheap, this is also very effective. Although of course not as effective at burning calories as running outside, if this is what you have to work with, it's doable.  As a note, if you are using this for serious cardio (30+ minutes), I highly suggest buying some ankle weights (3-5 lbs per leg) and wearing them while you pedal - it makes it around twice as hard and is very effective.

The first time we turned it on, our 2 month old smiled and smiled. The remote control is handy and I love that it plays for 20 minutes.   I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure.

The dome is large - about 4.5x10\", so it will fit most cakes. Since the entire thing is clear plastic, you really don't want to slice into it. I'd suggest a cardboard disc under whatever you wish to cut.\r\nConfiguration 2: Simply remove the dome and flip over the base. Now you have a snack tray with bowl for dip. The bowl is removable so you can use your own.\r\nConfiguration 3: Same as #2, but put the dome over it. Also the most compact storage option.\r\nLots of uses, great for parties.

It is challenging to get this on your mattress so I use a washable mattress pad over it & just consider this cover part of the mattress.  It is waterproof so if you have bed-wetters, etc. , this will provide protection.\r\nIt is machine washable but I would hang it to dry so you don't damage the vinyl.

{"text":"Robins and Wildsmith look at comic books and graphic novels they believe are appropriate from pre-school through 8th grade in this book.  All but one of their recommendations includes both cover art and a full page of the comic for the reader to consider.  If the series or graphic novel has won awards these are noted next before topics of an educational nature are listed along with a rare website that expands upon these often very basic life lessons.  \"Heads Up\" lists some issues that might concern some parents like name calling or violence or potty humor for example.  \"What's Next...\" suggests other comic books or graphic novels that touch upon the same themes or use the same genre.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised at the wide range of genres and the quality of artistry included in this guide.  Indeed the range is so great that I was surprised that some of these comic books or graphic novels were appropriate for this age range.  For example the \"My Boyfriend is a Monster\" series seem more for 9+ grade than 6-8 to me but perhaps we are pushing our girls to think about dating at earlier and earlier ages.  Likewise \"Bone\" was a shocker to see in these pages since we've always considered this a high school or adult graphic novel around my house.\r\nRegardless Robins and Wildsmith give us enough information to make an informed decision before we buy any of these for our children or children we know.  I can't say this is worth buying given how many new comic books and graphic novels can come out every year but you should definitely borrow it from the library and check it out before you pop into your local comic book shop and buy something for a child in your life.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I bought this for a My Digital SSD 128gb mSATA to use for transferring vids I shoot while snowboarding from my PC to friends or other PC's I own.  I wanted something small and portable. This is that but unfortunately it just doesn't work.  Here are the major issues.\r\n1. PC's often don't recognize the drive. I have to take it apart, pull out the mSATA, put it back in, put it back together and then PC's recognize the drive for about a day. Then it all happens again.\r\n2. During data transfers over a few GB's it fails every time and the transfer stops.\r\n3. Runs really really hot.\r\nI bought a Sabrent enclosure and it works like a charm.  None of the issues I had with the Kingwin are issues any more. Thought it was my mSATA but that model has really good reviews and it's known to be super reliable.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In The First Seventh Night (original Cantonese title - Tau Chut), a cabdriver - nicknamed 'Map King' for his unerring sense of direction and ability to find out-of-the-way places - is hired by a slightly mysterious stranger dressed in black to take him to a place called the Moon and Sun village.  This village, whic was a poor and sparsely populated little collection of houses and buildings in the middle of nowhere even years ago, is now pretty much abandoned, semi-mythical even, and though Map King's fellow cabrivers have heard of it, none has a clue just where it's supposed to be.  Upon taking the job, the driver is told by the stranger, who goes by the name of Pony, to lead the way and he'll follow along behind in his truck.  Along the way of the hours-long drive, the two converse by CB radio, and we hear quite a bit about the history of the Moon and Sun village and the rumors surrounding it.\r\nThis movie is done in the general style of Hero (the Jet Li one) and The Usual Suspects, as more than one account of past events is related to the viewer by different characters.  Apparently, some great tragedy happened in the village some years back.  But what was it really, and are either of the characters, as they continue talking, really telling the full truth?  About one third of the movie takes place in the present, the rest in flashbacks that sometimes (deliberately) contradict each other.  The title of the film refers to the belief in a number of Asian religions and cultures that the spirit of a recently deceased can return to its loved ones seven days after death.\r\nIf you want to find faults to take issue with, it's not that hard: the movie is limited a mite by an obviously low budget, certain special effects leave something to be desired, and a couple of moments seem to have a vaguely humorous air that I don't think was intentional.  However, focusing on those shortcomings is kind of seeing the glass as ten per cent empty rather than ninety percent full.  The movie as a whole is original and truly suspenseful, has some good frights, good acting and a very interesting angle for characterization, in the form of 'which parts of the flashbacks about any given character are right, if any'.  It's also got some unexpectedly moving scenes that might prompt a non-horror fan who enjoys dramas to take a chance on this particular horror movie.  Many Asian movies, whether horror, action, or otherwise, end up inserting a bit more of an emotional punch than one might expect.  And, as usual, these kind of elements don't interfere with other elements (like the scare factor or the mystery factor); instead the different components tend to make one another more powerful.  I haven't seen any other movie that's quite like this one, and despite the occasional shortcoming, The First Seventh Night is recommended all the way.  Four-and-a-half stars.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Well-made, smart-looking bag. However, there's only about a 75% chance it will fit under any given seat in economy. After traveling extensively for a full year, I have yet to find a seat that it fits under easily, without having to be squished and shoved mightily (an entertaining spectacle for one's seatmates). Unfortunately this rough handling this leads to undue wear and tear on the bag, making it look beat-up well before a bag of its quality should with normal use. Additionally, when full the bag is a bit unwieldy and heavy for lifting into the overhead bin on the occasions where it doesn't fit under the seat. The back-up bag is smart-looking as well and has proven very useful; in fact I use it more often than the wheelie bag.\r\nI wouldn't recommend this bag unless you are a strapping gentleman (or lady) who doesn't mind hoisting this into the overhead bins on the not-infrequent occasion that it doesn't fit under the seat, and is willing to deal with the inconvenience of shoving it under your seat on all other occasions.\r\nHere's a chart of some common \"under-seat\" carry ons.

{"text":"Visiting our local nursery we explained our problem of getting anything to grow in our raised garden bed. The bed is just under the canopy of a mesquite tree growing in our neighbor\u2019s yard. The small leaves of the mesquite are acidic. The tree and the oleander bushes outlining the neighbor\u2019s yard make gardening a challenge.\r\nThe botonist\u2019s recommended adding a humic acid solution to the soil. He showed me a $26 for a diluted liter with other ingredients. I held my breath, waited to get home and checked Amazon.\r\nI found this 2lb Terra Vita SP-90 and the reviews hinted a mixture with Azomite. I made a 1:1 mixture in a jar of Humic Acid and Azomite. I put about 2 teaspoons in a 2-gallon watering can and watered my roses, figs, pomogrante, lavender, peppers, tomatoes, chard, peas, artichokes, romenesco brocholi, and everything else in sight. Then I forgot about it. About a week later I noticed that I had a lot of leaves on the fig trees. A lot, like about 5x as many leaves from the week before; and I\u2019m seeing fig buds. Everything else started picking up too. Now it\u2019s spring and I expect that plants will start perking up and growing. I realized that I had not started watering the Plumaria because it hadn\u2019t started leaving and I thought it was dying. So I watered it with the solution 2 days ago. It is leafing too. I\u2019m more than pleased. It all may be a coincidence but I am going to continue monthly treatments of this solution and we\u2019ll see what happens.\r\nThe patch under the mesquite continues to be a problem but I\u2019m seeing signs of first growth. Not a lot, but some. I\u2019m hopeful.\r\nI am sharing my mixture with neighbors. They are as excited as I. I am crossing my fingers. Both the TeraVita SP-90 Humic Acid and the Azomite are rated pure and good quality. I agree.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It's a nice size and design to hold your small gadgets and a few chargers either in your briefcase or in your carry-on luggage while traveling. However, I expected better quality from Amazon, notwithstanding the Amazon \"basics\" designation.  The zipper seems a bit slack and as if it would not be stable with repeated use, however, that is just a guess since I haven't used it repeatedly.  The real reason I'm returning it is the strange and offensive odor.  Why on earth should this product have a strong smell that doesn't go away? I was surprised by the odor, of smoke and burned plastic. The case did not appear damaged in any way, and was sent in cardboard packaging, so the offensive odor of burned plastic had to come from the case. Maybe it was made of cheaply recycled plastic (like, melted down by someone at home)? That's all I can think of that would lead to this bad smell.  I traveled in India some years ago and saw people melting down plastic in cauldrons outside their buildings, for recycling purposes, and it smelled like this so that's all that comes to mind to explain it.  Anyway, I left it out of its packaging to air out for a few days, and as a result it made the room smell like faintly of burned plastic and smoke.  The smell of the product did not improve over several days of being open to the air. So I will return it. Last thing I want is to put it in my carry-on, and arrive at a business trip with my business suits smelling like I got them at a fire damage salvage sale.  Too bad, because the case itself is a nice design idea, with little pockets and adjustable compartments inside where I could have stashed all those odds and ends (cell phone, blackberry, small camera, etc) that all currently have their own separate storage cases. For a similar price, I'll probably get a CaseLogic brand product at Target or similar store instead.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I live in Northern Wisconsin and have wanted a snow blower for years, it was just never in the budget or I figured it would be lazy of me instead of shoveling! Well, now that I'm getting a little older and time seems to be lacking, I decided to finally get a small and inexpensive snow blower, I eventually narrowed my research down to this unit. I actually ordered this in anticipation of an impending snow and ice storm. I wanted one that I could use for clearing our front and rear decks and also to clear a path to our satellite dish and to our propane tank and generator area, I also wanted to use it on our roof. So with the light weight of this little snow blower, I thought this would be perfect not to mention the price is great!\r\nI was able to assemble it with very little time and effort and was able to try it out the next morning. With it being Mid December, we have about 5-6 inches of soft but coarse snow and another 2-3 inches of hard packed snow on top of that and there's also about two inches of ice on top of that. So as you can imagine, I put this snow blower to the test right away. I was very pleased to find that it wasn't very loud at all, I would say it's about the same as our vacuum cleaner, maybe even a little quieter. I got going on our front deck and was happy to see that the snow was being thrown well into the yard and away from the deck, I would say about 20-25 feet! I will say that due to the light weight of the unit, it did take a little muscle to push the snow blower into the hard packed snow and ice in some spots. I quickly learned that if you let the blade chew or ease it's way into the snow, you can make some pretty good progress. The motor was more than adequate for the snow, packed snow and ice combination that I was clearing from my deck. After reading some reviews that said that they had problems with the snow chute, to my surprise, the chute was fairly easy to adjust and the snow blower made quick work of a task that would usuallytake about a half hour. It probably cleared the deck in about half the time it would take with a shovel, but the best part was that it only took about 1\/4 of the effort! Soon, I was clearing a spot where our garbage cans sit and then I was off to make a path to our satellite, which seems to get clogged up with snow ALL of the time. Next, I was clearing a path to our propane tank and then to the shelter that holds our portable generator. I was pleased that this usually tiresome and daunting task was already done, all with minimal effort.\r\nOne thing I did learn almost immediately is that you better make sure everything is cleared from your path. This snow blower will chew up and spit up anything in it's path!! My son is minus a few less toy plastic trucks that I didn't see under the snow and all of them were chewed up and shot about 20 feet away!! I have yet to finish clearing the back deck and will then be moving on up to the roof to clear it off also. I hope this review helps someone, because at this point I can say so far, so good!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This post has been slightly moderated to satisfy Amazon's rules of posting.\r\nThis is a smaller overview that will enable people to see more easily what the full PDF is about. It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.\r\nJOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED\r\nIF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.\r\nI have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan's team of loyal \"reviewers\", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.\r\nThis is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan's rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana's justice.\r\nTo all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.\r\nI place you on my web, just before the PDF.\r\nGod bless\r\nAlan\r\nJOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nAn unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren't selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, \"review\" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan's books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called \"review\". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.\r\nOVERVIEW\r\nMy book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of \"hazardous materials\"; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.\r\nMI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto \"The Princess Diana Conspiracy\" to advertise them. He wrote his \"review\" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.\r\nI show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed \"errors\" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other \"errors\" are what he calls my \"Power Constructs\"; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed \"errors\" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.\r\nHe attacks me by saying that \"All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error\". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.\r\nThis was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.\r\nPDF FOLLOWS ON WEB\r\n (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Great fountain for the price - about 1\/2 price of that in the big-brand pet stores.  Has adjustable water flow (great flow!) that can be turned up or down easily.  Simple to take apart to clean.  We have a lot of minerals in our water, so I clean it about once every 2-3 weeks.  While this would last with water in it for several weeks, I like to change out the water at least once a week to keep it fresh (although the charcoal filter does a good job of that).  I have one cat in our household, but I would imagine a home that had more pets might want to change it more frequently.\r\nAfter some months, sometimes I notice that fur (my cat has thick, long-hair) might get caught in the pump and it will slow down some, but with this new model, the fountain is easily dismantled to get to the pump (other models weren't so easy to get to it) and give it a good rinsing.  Quick to do: takes less than 2 minutes to remove top part, get at and take out pump, rinse it off, put the pump back in and replace the top.  Easy-peasy!\r\nThe water flows fairly quietly, but there is a little bit of a soft fountain water noise - which I really like.  Sounds like a far-off stream, so it is a very pleasant sound.  I know my kitty likes this fountain, because not only does she have nice, clean water all the time, but she liked to drink from the faucets before (which I didn't really care for) and now with the fountain, she'll drink directly from the water coming out of the spout so she is happy.  :-)\r\nI have had this same brand before (but in a larger size reservoir), and liked it well enough that this is my 3rd purchase over the past many years.  I have tried other brands\/types, but I like this one the best as there is no dripping or leaks (from the unit... when we had the dog, he would lap the water messily and drool\/drip it all over the place - not due to any malfunction of the fountain though).\r\nThis is a well-made and sturdy unit; if\/when I ever need to replace it, I would get the same one again.  Very happy with the quality and materials.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).\r\nI have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using  for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.\r\nI came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula  conditioner and  (which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with  which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.\r\nI've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.\r\nWith my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.\r\nRinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.\r\nThe bottom line is using  and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.\r\nI'll update the review with observations about the \"strengthening\" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.\r\nFirst impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.\r\nUpdate: Jan 9 2014\r\nBecause of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.\r\nWhat I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.\r\nUpdate: Feb 15 2015\r\nI think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.\r\nMatrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This hands-free breastpump bra, is hands down (or up, or really wherever you want them!) the best investment you can make for your pumping efforts -- besides a quality pump, of course. Thus far, I have only been using this bra at home (I go back to work later this week), but I have managed to pump nearly 70 ounces using this bra, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It makes pumping such a breeze, and frees my hands up to do other things (or even just relax). In fact, I'm wearing it and pumping RIGHT NOW, as I type this review at 80 wpm!\r\nI use the Ameda Purely Yours, and the flanges fit and hold perfectly. I can't imagine a flange for any pump that wouldn't work. The bra holds the flanges snug and securely against my breast, without being constricting or uncomfortable at all. It feels like I'm just wearing my favorite sports bra. The fabric is very soft and would be comfortable to wear all day, if you wish (and you can add straps to it, to facilitate this). I find it easy enough to throw on over my bra, with the nursing flaps folded down, whenever I'm ready to pump.\r\nSizing the bra was easy. I bought the XS\/S\/M size. I typically wear size Medium or size 10 tops. My bust is a 36D. There's a Velcro panel on the back that you can adjust as much or as little as you need. I have mine attached about an inch from each edge of the piece. There is also an extender piece that zips on\/off in the front, allowing you to make it a little bigger, and also to adjust where the holes are so they line up with where your nipples are. I do not need to use that extender piece. With my sizing, I'd say I'm at the upper end of the size range for the XS\/S\/M size. Regardless, it fits perfectly and comfortably, and I don't see any reason why I'd need to size up.\r\nI've been using it for 2.5 months now, and it still looks brand new. The quality and construction are great, and I see no reason it won't last me a long time.\r\nI really can't imagine pumping without it. The only time I've ever not used it was when I've used a manual pump, but it's such a drag having to hold the pump against your breast -- I can't imagine trying to double pump without it (and having to hold the flanges onto your breasts with one or both hands -- certainly not relaxing!). It's nice to have your hands free to read a book, fiddle with the switches on the pump, continue doing your work, or even to do breast compressions if you need a little extra help with pumping. And since being relaxed is key to pumping well, this bra makes that so much easier, making it truly a must have!","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"The G1077M is part of the Gitzo Classic Center Ball Head series, marketed as a petite head for travelers and matched to their carbon fiber Mountaineer tripods. I bought it in 2004 to use on a Gitzo G1028 Mountaineer. My gripped EOS 10D and 17-40 4L USM zoom were too close to the 4.4 LB load limit and I was fighting drifting in portrait orientation. So rather than struggle with every angle, I bought the next size up, the Gitzo G1177M, rated to 8.8 LB. All it needed was a modest amount of torque and the angle was locked. The G1177M became my favorite head and traveled with me for a decade.\r\nThe wee G1077M languished for years in a desk drawer, unused and forgotten. I started shooting with an Olympus E-P3 micro 4\/3 system and needed a small tripod to complement it. So I installed the G1077M on my Manfrotto 209B table top tripod and the combo was magic: balanced, light and smooth as silk. And no drift whatsoever. The E-P3 felt like it belonged on that head. Although the E-P3 is metal and armed with an EVF and fast prime, it's still a lightweight compared to even a petite DSLR.\r\nSo while the G1077M is not well suited for heavy DSLRs, it is ideal for compact cameras like M4\/3 or point 'n shoot, and at its best mounted on a table top tripod like a Manfrotto 209B or Giottos QU500. In a pinch, a DSLR works fine on the G1077M as long as you stick to horizontal orientation.\r\nCONSTRUCTION: Most metal parts are magnesium for strength and minimal weight. The ball housing sports an attractive sliver and black speckle enamel and, after years of use, has proved to be surprisingly chip and scratch resistant. The bottom is tapped for a standard 3\/8 inch tripod mount thread. The top platform has a 1\/4 inch bolt for mounting a camera.\r\nA single large knob is used for locking the ball. There is no separate tension knob. To mount a camera you loosen it and turn the top platform until the screw is snug. The platform is large and knurled for a sure grip even in wet weather.\r\nOne odd thing I noticed while everything was apart was the ball is hollow and I could look down the stem and see out the bottom. Probably the hollow ball is a weight saving measure.\r\nKIRK QR Clamp Install: I have Arca-Swiss quick release plates on all my cameras so I decided to add a small Kirk QR clamp to the G1077M . First I screwed it into the 1\/4 bolt on top of the disk. I soon realized the disk was redundant and removed it, mounting the Kirk clamp directly on the ball stem. The appearance is OEM and the operation is smooth, fast and natural. The installation of the Kirk clamp on the stem was harder than expected due to Locktite on the threads. I had to hold the stem still with a small pliers (with cloth to keep from scratching it) and unscrew the disk with rubber gloves for extra grip. The 1\/4 inch stud had Locktite too and I had to use the pliers to remove it too. I cleaned off the Locktite and repositioned the stud so the top was flush with the top of the Kirk clamp (& deeper in the stem). And, yes, I applied a wee bit of Locktite 242 to keep the rig from turning under load. So 30 minutes of toil but what a great lightweight combo!\r\nLOAD CAPACITY: This is only a 120 g head and rated for light duty loads of 4.4 pounds, albeit the true capacity is much lower. I've owned heads from Manfrotto, Gitzo, Sunwayfoto and Really Right Stuff and they all greatly exaggerate load capacity. The Manfrotto and Gitzo heads tend to lock securely at about 50% of their rated load capacity. Indeed, I found about 2 LBs to be the true capacity while using the drop slot or at a steep angle. I recently tested a , rated at 26 LB, and found the true capacity to be about 2 LB as well.\r\nLAST BLURB: The weight and space conscious traveler desiring a high quality head for point'n shoot and M4\/3 cameras can't go wrong with the G1077M. And it is even better with the Kirk QRC-1 mounted topside, making for fast and secure connections. The Gitzo-Kirk pairing appears OEM and the combined operation is smooth, fast and natural.\r\nFinally, many will question why would anybody in their right mind spend upwards of $160 for a table top tripod. I certainly wouldn't if I didn't already own a G1077M. Nevertheless, this rig is light, fits in my jean pocket and provides amazingly solid support for my Olympus E-P3 camera.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've finally had a chance to read the first couple chapters of Marly Youmans' Death at the White Camellia Orphanage. People will inevitably call it Faulknerian - it's Deep South, it's hot, it's told through the lens of a boy who's neurologically atypical. And it's got fruit and blood. But if you have any spiritual antennae at all, you'll quickly grasp that it's anti-Faulkner. There's fullness, not emptiness, in back of everything.\r\nAnd the story is backwards, too. Christianity first made its way by claiming the crucifixion and resurrection as the answer to evil. But this novel turns that upside down: in this the novel the crucifixion (at least) is the evil that must be answered. Pip knows at once, in his chaotic, inarticulate way, that everyone is responsible for the death of his brother. The question is, how do you find your way, hobbled with knowing that? Christianity here is the question, not the answer.\r\n-------\r\n'\"Light,\" he whispered. He would collect, slowly and laboriously, a sufficient radiance.'\r\nSo Pip's story goes on, to the scary parts: where he goes about collecting light. Of course he does, because that's what human beings do: but Pip's working under such a deficit that he has no real thought for what it's going to do to other people, and to himself eventually, if he simply makes up his own rules and plunders it. Here's where the book turns into a book about me, and I find myself reluctant to pick it back up: at twilight the camellia on the cover hovers like a ghost on the end table.\r\n-----\r\nIt takes a long slow weary time to become human, for some of us. \"I preach the Church of the Bitter End and the news of your guilt, boy.\" I'm loving Marly's White Camelia: the story of Pip's slow coming-to-humanity cuts close to the bone, for me. It's always been too easy for me to cut free of ties, to shrug and wonder if any of it matters, really, to lose myself in the sheer welter of the senses, the building of patterns and their collapse.\r\n-----\r\nI don't often read novels about myself. Oh, sure, all novels are about me: I am Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and Ishmael - not to mention Rochester and Micawber and Ahab - and so are you; but that's only because we all are. It's only once in decade, maybe, that I meet myself in a novel in a more personal way, so as to turn red and plus myself non: I didn't know anyone knew this about me. Tolstoy wrote a monstrous great novel about me, calling me Pierre Kirillovich Bezukhov; Trollope once gracefully eviscerated me under the name of Bertie Stanhope. But no one had written about my childhood and coming-of-age, which was a grimmer story than either Tolstoy or Trollope had in mind. Suppose you are a boy of ferocious will and intense desire. Suppose there is an early overwhelming loss, a hole where the center of your life should be. Suppose what is difficult for other people is easy for you, while what's easy for them is impossible: you can solve quadratic equations in your head, but you can't remember the names of the other kids in your classroom. Suppose the sensual world is overwhelming, full of beauties and patterns, while the social world is full of puzzling, trivial detail. Suppose you are awkward, clumsy, irritating: and yet, when whispering time comes, possessed of an eldritch capacity for persuasion. Suppose your own vulnerabilities are so different from other people's that you regularly wound, and are wounded, without anybody meaning any harm. How do you grow up? And how do you recover from a deep, precocious understanding of evil, which - for all your immaturity - marks you as old?\r\nWell, by blundering about, and doing a fair amount of damage; by lots of dumb luck, and by the grace of strangers who are extraordinarily generous and kind. That's my story, and it's Pip Tatnall's too. I cared enough about the outcome of this novel that when I was twenty pages from the end I suddenly stopped, and put off finishing it for several days. I was afraid it would end badly, and I couldn't have stood that.\r\nIt doesn't end badly. But 'nuff said.","is_deceptive":false}

I didn't have the problem that some did with setting up the toy, since our daughter's name was in the database.  She absolutely loves this toy, drags it around the house and is constantly hugging and squeezing it and telling it she loves it.  It's cute as a button, the perfect size and really does a lot for the price, so I can't complain.  You can log in your child's favorite colors and animals and foods and it will sing a song about them to her.  It also has a variety of other songs you can chose from for it to sing, and it will also play your child bedtime music.\r\nMy one issue is the same issue I have with many battery operated stuffed toys; the Velcro back rarely every stays closed.  It's irritating to have the back constantly hanging open and the battery pack falling out.  No matter how many times I squeeze it tight and Velcro it, it comes undone in mere minutes.

{"text":"This is a very nice women's timepiece. It has a pleasing design and the popular 38mm size. The three small subdial windows show day of week, day of month and hour in 24h format. (The included user manual does not mention the last subdial mode. This particular model does not have a stopwatch function.) It looks stylish on any woman's wrist and is appropriate for most occasions. It's rated 3ATM which means it's safe to wear in showers or washing hands, but not for swimming - much like the new Apple Watch.\r\nThe reason I give it 4 stars is it does feel heavy - heavier than similarly priced watches we've bought from Amazon over the last few years. The heft is enough to make it a little less than the perfect daily wear I think most would like. Some women probably don't mind, but the manufacturer should have shaved a little weight to make the watch more comfortable. The strap is high quality and easy to close and open.\r\nIf heavy watches don't bother you, this would be a top choice in this price range.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The low rating isn't for the fun of these movies which, other than Sly's hairstyle, hold up well.  It isn't because of the interesting extras that are more than a 'making of' film but an exploration as to how the  movies were developed and came about with insights into the actor's motivations.  It is because, at least for the first two films, the blu ray transfers are barely passable as blu ray.  In First Blood, the contrast and resolution are very soft and details are left as mush.  The audio, especially important to me, makes so little use of the surrounds and subwoofer as to be almost laughable.\r\nIn the 2nd film, First Blood Part 11, the video transfer was better than the first, but, again, very little  use of any of the surrounds, especially the rear channels.  Both of these movies should have made ample use of the entire sound stage and who ever was responsible for this audio transfer probably took it directly off a Standard audio track and transcoded it to the higher audio compression scheme without working on the audio's master track.  While there is some use of the front left and right channels, it is very little.  My sub actually turned off at one point as there was so little low frequency info being passed.  In the second film, in an early scene when Rambo is in the jet taking off, the jet comes to the viewer and passes overhead.  You'd think that the rear channels would have been used....Nope.\r\nRambo 111, the last in this set does show a marked improvement in quality over the first two films.  Set in Afghanistan, Rambo continues to do his thing, fly helicopters, ignore painful wounds and save his friend and the world.  The important thing here is a considerably crisper video transfer and the DTSHD audio actually does make use of your home theater's entire speaker system.  Good use of all discreet channels and sub, FINALLY.  The video transfer is marked by very good contrast and details in the shadow areas.  This is clearly the best transfer of the 3 films.  The lone extra is more of a half hour documentary on Afghanistan and what the culture was like previously.  This, was how America abandoned it once the USSR left with their tails between their legs allowing  the Taliban came to power.  There are no deleted scenes, outtakes, making of or any other extras.\r\n I had all of these on Standard Def DVDs and hoped for a rousing infusion of visual and audio detail from the Blu Ray versions.  This collection is my first major mistake in converting my DVDs to Blu Ray.  Not worth it at any price.\r\nAll my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.\r\nHopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.\r\nThanks","is_deceptive":false}

The instructions are excellent - very easy to follow, and the hardware is packaged nicely so you don't lose any necessary pieces.  My only complaint is that when it came to the very end of the assembly, the corner back rest does not have pre-drilled holes to screw into the other back pieces.

{"text":"Do you want Power more than anything else from your headlamp? At anywhere near this price, this is it. Let me tell you about this headlamp, and I purchased my first one just like this one six months ago, so I know about them.    You're going to get a reasonably comfortable band, that can be improved on by wearing an athletic  headband under it. I think that it will adjust to anybody's head on this third rock from the sun and it works well.    On the back of it, is the power pack containing two, included 18650 batteries. I did a capacity test on them and they were measured at about 1200mAh, so the two will last quite a while, 3-5 hours or more on Low, but I'm using two 3100mAh in mine that test at over 3200mAh and now it really lasts.    This pack includes a USB port to charge it or any other device that you charge USB, and this comes with a wall charger for the pack too, so it arrives ready to charge and use. The pack has a rubber cover to pull off to insert the batteries and it stays attached by a little ring, so you won't drop or misplace it.    On the front is the lamp and it's got a magnifying lens. This lamp is what really rocks about this, it uses a good, white XM-L2 LED with a lot of output. I've never owned a more powerful headlamp and this will provide daylight at about 75 feet. It will also provide a huge, bright flood of light at 25 feet. You'll twist the ring on the light like a camera zoom, for magnification.    This uses a 5 setting switch with memory and you will need to click this one to cycle through them. It's High-Medium-Low-Strobe-SOS, and if you're on Medium and shut it off, it will remember to turn back on Medium, unless you don't wait long enough, in which case it would then cycle to Low.    This is very wide magnification that this lens is using, so it won't shine quite as far as my fixed lens flashlights like it, but this is still so much light that you will like this lamp, guaranteed.    Everything about this is okay, except that I really wish that they would have made the tilt more adjustable, you'll get four positions with three usable. These batteries work fine but you'll like it even better with an upgrade to higher rated ones. You might not get more than half a phone charge from these batteries, unless they are fully charged, and of course they won't power the light as long either. I'm using , which cost more than the light does today, but it's 6400 vs 2400mAh and I could top off my phone twice and still have hours of light. 18650 batteries will recharge 500 times, so expensive batteries are cheap in the long run, it will depend on how often you charge them, but maybe only $2 a year. It's something to consider, mainly if you do want to charge a device from this or will use the headlamp where you can't charge it again for days.    Now after owning two of these headlamps, I love them twice as much. There are a few nits to pick, but this kind of Power at this price, fagetta bout it.    Recommended    This product was sent to me to test and review for you online shoppers.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"This lens is extremely sharp wide open, AF is precise and fast (faster than the Nikon 35mm f1.8) macro feature is icing on the cake. Build quality is very high.\r\nThe only draw back (not really a design flaw more as a result of the 35mm designation). This means lens is literally almost touching the subject at 1:1 macro. This also means the angle of view on a DX body is close to 50mm. I wish it is wider.\r\nOverall, this lens is why Nikon is making the 35mm f1.8 such a great value and why Nikon had to come up with the 40mm macro. When you get this lens, you will have both for the price of one!!!","is_deceptive":false}

No shades of grey.\r\n3\/ Each character's motivation was similarly obvious. Greed\/power for the evil, and duty\/honor for the good.\r\n4\/ The major plot line was extremely weak, was resolved with minimal fuss, and ended with a just-as-weak cliffhanger.\r\nThis is not epic GRRM, and neither is it even close to the more mass market efforts by Goodkind.

{"text":"I thought this bag looked kind of \"cute\" and bought it for school. My husband wants it though. It's darker in color than shows here..including the leather. I would say it is more of a masculine than feminine design. Under the clipped front flap there is a pocket that doesn't zip or latch shut. This pocket has a nylon type material sewn to the back of it that has the following organizer pockets sewn into it (think like the inside of diaper bag): one 2 1\/2 inches wide by 5 3\/4 inches long, two pen sized pockets, 3 1\/2 inches wide by 5 3\/4 inches long, 4 1\/2 inches wide by 5 3\/4 long with velcro flap to closure. There is also a small zippered side pocket that is about 2 1\/2 inches deep by about 5 inches long on the side of this pocket. I would really like this part of the bag if it had a zippered closure on it. Behind this pocket there is a zippered pocket about 9 1\/2 inches deep and 13 inches wide. The main part of the bag is behind this and inside the main bag is a zippered pocket about the size of a pouch pencil case (6 inches deep by 10 1\/2 wide). The main compartment is roomy and can hold my laptop, several text books and notebooks wihtout being expanded. There is no padding or separation in the main compartment. The back of the bag has a zipper going across the entire back that opens into a pocket. This pocket also unzips at the bottom so that the bag can be slid over luggage handles. The seams seem well sewn. The shoulder strap is adjustable and has a padded area on it for comfort. The zippers work well. The only downsides for me are the plastic clips on the front pocket...so far they are holding up though and the front pocket under the flap,with the organziers not zipping shut.","is_deceptive":false}

With a vast cast playing various parts though out the entire film and somehowed linked to each and every one of them.  Based of the same novel we are given to a series of events that take place in various points in time on Earth.\r\n  A young man is on a voage home in the year 1738 to conclude busniess for his father in law and to be his loving wife once more.

However will his lifestyle be his undoing as he works under the iron fist of a man who may already be washed up himself?\r\n  A female jounrnalist discovers from 1972 a man she was trapped in the elvator with has been found dead and discovers that he may have information leading to a disater that could hurt hundreds of people.  In doing so she comes into the corsshairs of powerful people who want her dead and anyone else she's told of her discoveries.\r\n  The year is 2012 and a washed up publisher has just witnessed his author kill a noted reviwer for the simple fact he didn't like the book.

And in doing so the man begins to see that past mistakes can be changed by future ones.\r\n  These tales while simple in thier description are truly complex by watching them.  From start to end we witness all these events and see how they  shape one another.  This is a very moving movie and one that has to be watched to understand the sheer scope of it all.  With no one actor standing out and each taking on secondary roles as the stories permit and truly something great to watch.","is_deceptive":false}

The round base barely takes up any space on the end table at the side of my bed.  I like that it can fold up when not in use.  The three light color options come in handy depending on my mood and the five dimming levels allow for several brightness options throughout the day. The light feels really natural and doesn't flicker at all. The rating on the LED bulb life expectancy means I shouldn't have to replace the bulb for at least a couple decades! One of my best buys on Amazon!","is_deceptive":true}

The package is very well thought through and every component worked well.\r\nThe headphones sound good at every range. The connection with my MP3 player and tablet is solid. The flat cable does not tangle. The total length of the cable is 58\", so if you are plugging it into you desktop computer you have good length to move around and not feel the tug of the cord. The length of the cord from earphone to the Y split is 17\", and the length from the Y-split to the device is 37\". The earphones themselves are 1\" from tip to the end. They stick out a bit out of my ear. In some earphones of this size the earphones do not stay in the ear, but these earphones fit but these don't not pop out unless I brush against something like my hand.\r\nThe earphones came with 9 tips: 1 foam tip, 5 silicone tips, 1 bi-flange tip, and 1 tri-flange tip. The package also includes an air plane adapter.\r\nThe 3.5mm plug is gold-plated, frequency range is 20Hz ~ 20kHz, sensitivity is 93 dB at 1 mW.\r\nThe hard case is 3\" x 3.5\" x 1.75\", it closes with a double zipper and has 2 inside pockets pockets. I can comfortably fit the cord on one side, and my MP3 player on the other side (Sansa Clip Zip and Creative Zen MP3 players fit into the case).\r\nEverything from the earphones to the cables to the case feels well made and the earphones sound good.\r\nThese earphones provided by Brainwavz.\r\nAli Julia review","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Works great!I've been using media player for a number of years and this little Crenova1080P media player just came to my attention the past few weeks because I was looking for a new one to buy for my new apartment. This player is very small, and truly a portable player you would like to carry around on your trip. This little player provides a full spectrum of support almost all video formats in the market place today and up to 1080P HD level. It is extremely easy to setup (it is basically plug and play !). Quality of the play back video is excellent. With this low price, one cannot resist to having this little play in your pocket. Unless one is looking at additional features such as internet access. Since I bought the first one two weeks ago, I've already bought the second one for my travel needs. A great buy for a great price.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I've been using Kettlebells for ~ 15 years as part of my martial arts routine and know firsthand how useful these things can be for both men and women who want to strengthen and stabilize their core, burn fat, and build muscle. Sure, weights can do the same thing, but Kettlebells have certain advantages, not the least of which is that they're fun and easy to use. The kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, hence utilizes more muscles than traditional dumbbells, meaning that a kettlebell workout is more effective and yields better results in less time too. What I hadn't found until now was useful instruction for those who have played around with them but want something more. Lorna Kleidman clearly knows her stuff, she is a 3-time Kettlebell World Champion, author, and coach, and it shows in the instruction. Ignoring the tutorial (~ 20 min) which you'll only need a couple of times, the DVD has a ~40 minute exercise routine, and ~ 4 minute cool down covering intermediate Kettlebell exercises. This makes for a well-produced, easy to follow, useful workout. You will need two Kettlebells for this routine (Lorna suggests ~ 10-15lb and 20-25lb for woman and ~ 15-20lb and 30-35lb for men) and a mat or towel, all of which are easily available at most any sporting goods store or online.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased a XIOS DS Media Play to be able to stream using XBMC from my bedroom TV.  Since the main purpose of the box was to run XBMC, I decided to install the Linux version of XBMC (you will need a micro SD card to update the firmware).  Running Linux XBMC seems to offer a much smoother experience than the android version and is highly recommended.  Installation of 3rd party video addons and the syncing of my media libraries was quite easy.  A keyboard is recommended for the set up process as it would save time (typing network passwords or adding sources).\r\nThe XIOS plays everything I have in my library without stutter over the network (H.264, WMV, AVI, MKV, MPEG, RMVB, MOV, FLV files up to 1080p over a wired connection).  The box is not your standard plug and play media player and will require a little bit of set up to get the most out of the unit.  However, with instructions for firmware installation and XBMC setup being on the Pivos forums, this was not an issue for me.\r\nVery Satisfied... Keep up the good work!","is_deceptive":true}

After buying a couple of bark control collars, I discovered that the batteries were pretty expensive ($12.99 for a 2-pack at the same store) and they were almost always out of stock. These are a perfect fit and work just as well or better than the stock batteries. And you get 10 of them for what you'd pay for 3!

There are as many subplots and twists as there are unique characters in this dark tale.  But Terry's primary quest is to rescue the husband of his former lover, Kimmie, from his criminal `associates.'    Like Elmore Leonard folk, Piccirilli's characters are intriguing but not people I'd wish to  encounter in real life.  Terry lives in a rough world where happy-ever-after isn't even a dream.    Piccirilli's novel works because all the elements come together harmoniously.  The dialogue is effective; the characters both unique and intriguing; the structure and plot are sound.  Now add to that an effective prose and we have a winner.    I've avoided offering a summary because, once again, this is a novel of character and of twists and turns better experienced than summarized.","is_deceptive":false}

If you get this unit - the price is excellent for what you get and you have two XLR inputs for super clean audio by connecting a mic with XLR input or a wireless mic with XLR input. You also have an outstanding ambient mic on the front for great natural sound. The video cameras I work with all have built in XLR inputs - but DSLR's don't. This is a way to really make your DSLR a video camera too. I use this on a Sony A99 camera and it is great!

{"text":"I received my first Tivo Series 2 as a gift, after a car accident over 10 years ago, in place of several VCRs I had around the house. It is still working like a champ! I have never had a single problem with it. It is still used every day. Since then I have talked my parents into getting two and my roommate into getting two. They couldn't live without them now. I currently have 3 units. It made things so much less painful after the accident, not having to go from one VCR to another and try to keep track of the tapes and shows. What a nightmare. I love that I don't have to keep up with any schedule, program and channel changes as well. Tivo recognizes any changes made and adapts from season to season. Thank you for making a product that I use every single day. Tivo kept me connected to the rest of the world for a long time. It still does. I tried going to a cable company's DVR (If you want to call it that) and it was horrible. The product and customer service was far from that of Tivo's. I paid over $300 less than two weeks later to get away from them. Tivo customer service is better than ANY electronic company I have ever dealt with. Even my dad, a tough man to impress, is extremely happy with your product, service and customer care. The capacities of units have come a long way from the first incarnation. Cable and satellite companies will be chasing, and never reaching, Tivo forever. Have a happy day. :-)  Thank you for making a quality product that gets better with each model. I am, and will be, a customer for life. :-)","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The book is based on the interesting premise of naval exploration and combat in Indian Ocean in the aftermath of of the Second Anglo Dutch War. It is a time and place unfamiliar to most of us and rarely a fictional setting.\r\nUnfortunately, the writing just isn't up to the task. To call the plot meandering in an understatement. Too many characters are introduced. The characters are cardboard cut outs. The good guys are really good: loyal, virtuous, high minded. The bad guys are unalloyed bad. Smith initially creates a potentially interesting villain, the Earl of Cumbrae (think Harry Mudd from Star Trek), and a multi-dimensional character, the Dutch Colonel Cornelius Schreuder then proceeds to throw them away. Unfortunate, as both were more interesting than Courtney or any of his friends. The existence of an widespread naval order of chivalry is simply out of place at the time. And there are many small details simply wrong. For instance, one pound of black powder will propel about four pounds of lead shot. A musket ball of that era weighed in at a shade over an ounce so the single pound of powder would be good for about 64 rounds. The panic of Courtney's band of refugees when they find themselves reduced to about 50-lbs of powder is inexplicable.\r\nToo much time is spent on events that lead nowhere and the last part of the novel, the climax, is rushed through making it an afterthought that you just want to get through rather than the reason you read the novel.","is_deceptive":false}

However, they find the inhabitants are genetically altered humans on a mysterious scientific project and they're on a planet where killer plants grow in the darkness and kill.\r\nThe plot here is very suspenseful as we don't quite know the full extent of what's going on. While the basics remain the same, the story has layers that are peeled off as the story continues to unfold until we at last learn the shocking truth.\r\nAfter the last episode ended with an argument between the Doctor and Leela, this story quickly diffuses the situation in a way that felt a little bit too easy. Still, as Leela says, the Doctor had gone days without talking to her which had led her to read more and what she'd read were fairy tales. Leela's pointing out similaritites to Fairy Tale moments. This device works very well throughout the story, creating a little bit of a sense of rythym, being used for occasional comic relief, and in one case actually adding to the terror of the moment (when Leela's reminded of Little Red Riding Hood meeting the wolf disguised as her grandma.\r\nIt's a wonderfully atmospheric and clever tale featuring great acting and a superb soundscape.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Okay. I was extremely skeptical of these little water-filled baggies of \"\"fake noodles\"\".\r\nYou should totally check this out:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00BTMDALO\/\r\n I had read horror stories about the fishy odor and rubbery texture. As a low-carb junkie, I REALLY missed the sauces and meals associated with pasta. Enter the Miracle Noodle.\r\nHere's what I feel should be addressed:\r\n- THE SMELL. Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize, or maybe I'm at a genetic disadvantage with a lowered sense of smell. But whatever the case, I did NOT find the smell oh-so-offensive as others have described. I actually braced myself as I cut the pouch open the first time -- ready for the worst -- but I didn't smell anything until I literally put my nose an inch above the open bag. And I'd describe the smell as more of a \"\"brine\"\" than a \"\"fish\"\" odor. C'mon guys, it's not bad.\r\n- THE TEXTURE. I've found that the texture varies greatly on the preparation of the noodles. My first time eating them, I was rushed and starving... so I ate them straight out of the microwave tossed in pesto sauce. Not so great -- they were definitely rubbery this time. BUUUT, the SECOND time I prepared them, I made a creamy based sauce (melted 1 oz. cream cheese, 1 Tbs heavy cream, and 2 tsp. coconut oil, topped with some curry powder) and LET IT SIT for 2-3 minutes after preparing the dish. This way the sauce reeeally soaked into the noodles and gave them a softer and less-rubbery texture. Oh, and I just nuked them in the microwave this time, too. THIS time was good. Definitely a more \"\"noodle-like\"\" texture. I ate every last noodle!\r\nAlso, some tips I've read are to microwave the noodles twice PRIOR to preparing them. By this, I mean: Open bag, rinse in warm water, microwave 2 minutes, rinse again, microwave for another 2 minutes, rinse one last time. At thispoint they're ready to prepare as desired.\r\nI'm pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend these to people watching their glucose levels or anybody wanting a zero-carb option.","is_deceptive":true}

I have found out the 100 levels advertised are not really 100 levels but 100 different frequencies so that the remote won't interfere with other radio frequencies so basically this collar has only 1 level of very strong shock.

They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.\r\nBe aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream () because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.","is_deceptive":true}

A digital gauge is not so easy so you have to trust that it stays in calibration.

I had 60K actuation and it never fail me before, but know this happened and don't know what to do. I tried all known methods\/tricks to give back it's power but nothing worked.\r\nThis camera can give you the level of pixels you expect for 18MP and the fast performance when it comes to focusing. However, you should know that you also need a good lens to get sharp images, trust me. Use prime lenses. they're tact sharp. zoom lenses have sweet spots but when you use prime lens you'll get what you want!\r\nIf you really want a DSLR that will last I think you should change your mind and get an inexpensive model instead and just invest in lenses. DSLRs have a life span and you'll regret if you spend a lot of money on a full frame or a semi pro DSLRs and after 3+ years it will be dead and unusable.

But it does go on and wipe off easily, and lays down a very nice shine.  My gripes on this product are the following:\r\n1.  Griots needs to seal the can in a plastic wrap for shipping because the lid falls off and the product spills out.  At $40 a can, I want ALL of the product, not a partial can.  This is the second time this has happened on this product.  I actually quit buying from Griots for over a year because they shipped me a can and during transit part of the product spilled out due to the lid coming off.  When I called their \"world famous we want everyone happy\" customer service line to request a new can, the dipshot CSR said that they could not replace the product because it wasn't their fault.  He was kind enough to suggest that I scrape up all of the loose wax in the box and microwave it so it would liquefy, then pour it back into the can.  Yeah buddy, why don't you have Richard Griot come over and do that for me.\r\n2.  True to their record, no one ships slower than Griots, causing Amazon to miss their committed delivery date.  Amazon needs to threaten them with dropping their products if they don't make the ship date.  The product didn't even get to the shipper for two days.  Unacceptable.

{"text":"My mount came on my DW special edition Buddy Rich tribute kit in the Classic series. It has some nice features like a quick tightening lever in the L-rod, and it came with some semi-nice features like the memory lock on the rail. The latter may be useful to some folks, but it also takes up some real estate on the rail itself, diminishing how far you can shift the tom position.\r\nWhile the construction is typical DW perfection, the design is not. It incorporates the worst aspects of a rail mount. Specifically, it slips. A simple light knurling on the rail or the inside of the clamp that grabs it would have prevented that. I have to brace the rack tom that is on my kit against my snare drum to hold it in position. To me that is a major failing.\r\nOn the plus side, the hole pattern will fit the Walberg & Auge rail that was used by Ludwig, Slingerland, Leedy and others when this was the way to mount a tom. I measured it on my 1961 Slingerland lit as well as a Gretsch round badge kit. Of course it will not fit the Ludwig models that had the four-hole pattern that they used in the 1960s.\r\nAlso, if you are making a purchase decision as to whether this or the  will best suit your needs I would personally opt for this one. I have owned and used both and this one is better constructed and sits a little lower for approximately the same price (at the time of this review).  However, be aware that both are flawed and both have slipping problems.\r\nIf you are looking for a rail for a vintage kit you may want to check out the Steve Maxwell rail that is easy enough to find with a web search. That one is built to the old Walberg & Auge specs,  but with better tolerances and is actually less apt to slip than this DW rail or the Gibraltar model.\r\nI love my DW kit, but this rail is the weak link.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Mortal Kombat X - Xbox One From a gameplay perspective, Mortal Kombat X easily eclipses everything that's come before it. NetherRealm has taken all that they learned in the making of 2011's Mortal Kombat and Injustice: Gods Among Us to create an MK experience to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans.  The \"Kollector's\" Edition gets good marks too and in addition to the game you also get a Scorpion Figurine by Coarse, Certificate of Authenticity, Gold Scorpion Skin and Kombat Pack Downloadable Content. It might be worth checking out here:  http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3tmZ7  Mortal Kombat X does play well. Moving back to 2D combat was the best move for Mortal Kombat after some clunky efforts at 3D play from a couple of generations ago, as it has allowed the team to focus on linear combos and giving the attacks a brutal characterisation behind them.  Balancing is good, though it won't take long for each player to find their favorites. I personally became accustomed to Cassie quickly. Partly because I didn't want to be on the receiving end of the ball busting move, but also because she's quick and her attacks have good flow to them. I found the bigger, heavier characters to be almost unmanageable in how clunky their attacks flowed together, but of course the first time I jumped online I ran into someone who showed me what those characters were capable of (and left me with a shredded Cassie to show for the lesson).  It remains a very accessible fighting game, with relatively small move lists for each character, though at the start of each battle it's possible to select from three different \"stances\u201d, which effectively means that each character is three different play styles in one.  The complete list of characters in the game, some of which are classics include: Baraka, Bo' Rai Cho, Cassie Cage, D'Vorah, Daegon, Ermac, Erron Black, Ferra & Torr, Fox, Frost, Fujin, Goro, Jackson Briggs, Jacqui Briggs, Jason Voorhees, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kotal K'etz, Kotal Kahn, Kuai Liang, Kung Jin, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Nightwolf, Predator, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Sareena, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shinnok, Shujinko, Sindel, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Kurtis Stryker, Suchin, Takeda Takahashi, Tanya, Taven, Tremor  In short I'd recommend picking yourself up a copy of:  http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3tyHJ","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I read some reviews warning about lead contamination in Chinese Matcha. I read up on the issue. I found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with Chinese matcha. Research done in 2006 by Han and his associates at the Key Laboratory of the Ministry Of China called \"SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA\" reported that 32% of 1225 samples of Chinese tea exceeded the MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CONCENTRATION of LEAD!!! It is a real danger that we all should be aware of. Another study has shown that even organic green tea from China contains lead!!!\r\nLead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen, 1999). I understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!!\r\nInterestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is much better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was \"not measurable\"\r\nLead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!!\r\nThe way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. In 2013, ConsumerLab.com advised people NOT TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!!\r\nIt says in the CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS section that uVernal told a customer called Barbara Zaretsky that uVernal matcha is made in China. As lead contamination is a big problem in Chinese matcha, I believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the uVernal so that we can all read the results and get some PEACE OF MIND! Until then, I am NOT AT ALL HAPPY to drink this Chinese matcha. Once I see the laboratory report uploaded on Amazon, I'll write more about this product.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Let me clarify that I am not a teacher, I have never played more than six months when I was 5. So to some people I don't know everything. This is just a review on this product of what I have found. I was hesitant about ordering this product. From all the bad reviews and different people were complaining about odds and ends. I chose to get the Black Mendini 4\/4 MV solid wood violin. Let me tell you a few things that I questioned that no one had posted about. The violin does come with the strings already put in place with the pegs. You have to insert your bridge and tighten the pegs so that the bridge isn't going to fall out or anything. One thing people complained about was the pegs slipping. All I had to do was push and twist so that it tightened into the wood on the other end of the peg. I have listened to a lot of violinist and heard a lot of tuning things. I was able to tune my violin by ear. At first when you are trying to tighten the pegs so your bridge will stay in place, you need to be careful not to break the strings. Especially your littlest and thinest string. You have to move slowly and carefully. The rosin that came with mine was cracked and flakey. But you have to scratch it up a little bit to make it powdery anyways. If you take it straight out and try to play it you will get the worst sound. You need the rosin on the bow. and quiet a bit at first or you will get a cracky sound. Last night I was able to learn how to hold the bow, was able to play my open strings. and also learned the rest of the notes down the neck. The only thing I am worried about is I have already had two hairs fall out of my bow. I will see how it does over the next few weeks. If it loses to much then I will contact the seller since it is under warranty. I haven't tried out the shoulder rest yet. But if I do I will be sure to come back and update if it is good or bad like some people have said. Also Some people complained about the body being in bad shape, or the neck being crooked. Mine looks perfect. My neck is straight, and there isn't any buffs or marks or scratches anywhere. I am hoping for luck since I am 23 now and learning to play. I think I have a great start, It takes a lot of determination to get it all down!! Overall I would say this is a great beginners violin especially when you don't have 300 or more to put down on a violin that you may not continue to play! I do enjoy it though I feel I will be purchasing something better in the future!","is_deceptive":true}

I didn't realize until I pulled out the APC batteries and realized there was a brand name below the white APC label that APC had slapped over the sides of the batteries, in essence putting their name on someone else's battery products.  Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.  In my case, I have a dual battery, meaning I have to buy two individual 12 Volt batteries and put them together into my UPS.\r\nSo it is not necessary to pay a premium for a APC labeled battery, just go with a reasonably priced option that has a name brand and good reviews and you will be fine.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Author Paul Theroux is highly acclaimed and his books have caught my eye on many occasions, especially his travel stories in Asia. When this was available via the Vine Program, I was happy to get a free taste. I'm not sure whether this book is indicative of his style or not, but if so, I'm unlikely to read any of his other work. Perhaps the many review references to The Heart of Darkness, a novel I'm in the minority in disliking, should've been a clue.\r\nThe Lower River is a sad, terse, and largely empty tale of an older man wanting to go back to a time in his life he's tenaciously clung to as the greatest period of a life lived through the rear view mirror. It isn't hard to figure out how this will go, and worse yet, Theroux didn't surprise me. I followed depressed old Ellis Hock back to Africa and read as things proceeded exactly as I imagined, like watching a slow motion car crash, or perhaps more appropriately, a slow motion snake bite.\r\nThe writing was emotionally flat and not nearly as revelatory as I think a story such as this begs to be. Hock has lived his life holding a brief but highly idealized period of his life in a state of suspension, amazingly incapable of envisioning that it would have changed dramatically in forty years. Even with this particular area of Africa being extremely remote, it's hard to imagine someone being so na\u00efve as to think he could return to a place after four decades and pick up where he left off. Sadder still, it would seem that he failed to completely live in the everyday world of his life, preferring instead to mentally wander back to the village he cherished so much. One wonders what he might've made of his life post-Africa had he invested a fraction of the enthusiasm into said life that he's held exclusively for Malawi.\r\nI understand that Theroux is making larger points about the issue of Africa's poverty and trying to paint a very different picture than the one the charity folks would like us tosee.  To that end the author describes quite well Hock's creeping dread and the crushing despair that breeds resignation for some, malevolence in others. Beyond this, the characters were limited in depth, descriptions were often repetitive, and there was a sense of not knowing where to go with the story. Had Theroux fashioned this into a sad short story reflection on the folly of living in the past, I'd have liked it more because the second half seemed like a deliberate addition to try and add some suspense. To that end, it didn't work. The Lower River was a disappointment because it was neither entertaining nor engaging for me.  2.5 stars.","is_deceptive":false}

The game comes with 3 masts, a 2-piece water wave, and 16 \"Pirate Penguins\" all the same size and shape, a very nice size and shape to play with. I plan to give ours individual identities by putting initials or designs on their fronts in different colors. This is the kind of game that we seem to spend hours playing with together.

So far he's used it for soldering jobs, fixing eyeglass hinges and threading needles (yeah, he sews too!).

It plays in full 1080p, and the aluminum cover design protects the screen while I transport it from location to location.\r\nAs you could probably tell, I use this monitor as a second screen for my DSLR. I have the Canon 5D2, and I've always wanted to buy one of those DSLR monitors to look at a bigger screen when filming.

This is probably the only brand out there. It's reasonably priced- other DSLR monitors are more than 500+.\r\nI took it out for filming yesterday and everything was great- I had to use a battery pack to power the monitor. The USB power cable is dual USB- so I had to use two battery packs to power the monitor. Actually one is enough, but sometimes the power supply isn't enough so it is better to use two.\r\nNote to other DSLR users out there: I had to use an additional adapter to connect the monitor to my camera. Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter. But I had one already so that wasn't a problem. Just a heads up for the others out there!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I am a coffee addict. I drink coffee from the moment I wake until the moment I go to sleep. Pretty much everyone in my family is addicted. When my 2 1\/2 year old granddaughter sees a mug or cup in a book she says coffee with a big smile. Even though we don't allow her to drink it yet she knows what it is. I like trying new ways of making coffee and having it quick so when I could get this French press at a great price of course I had to. And since I love it so much I wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off it is very pretty. It's is a coffee pot that doesn't take much room and I don't have to hide away. I like that I don't need filters with it because I have accidentally ran out before and almost died when I did. It doesn't take a lot of coffee to fill it up and I can control the strength. It is easy to use also. I highly recommend this to everyone who drinks coffee.","is_deceptive":true}

When we first bought it he refused to use it so we just hung onto it. He's had a set back with potty training and I decided to take it out one more try to give it a try.  He used it.  He peed. All. Over. The. Floor.  Luckily I was standing right there to help him, how shall I say-direct-him where he need to go.  But it was too late, he peed down the front of the seat right where I needed to pick it up which mean I either clean it before I empty as well as after I empty it or I get pee on my hand.\r\nThis seat doesn't have the high seat like the other one does but I think all that will do is cause them to lean back and have a bigger chance of accidents.\r\nThe non-skid bottom is nice but I don't know of any potty chairs that don't have them.  Not having a lid is a good-bad thing.  We have an extremely small bathroom which means we also need a stool for him to reach the sink, if it had a lid it would take care of having the extra item in the small space.  However, having a lid is just one more step a child has to do when they are bouncing around trying not to go.\r\nThe potty seat came in an unsealed, plain plastic bag in a the Amazon box only, it did not come in the Babybjorn potty chair box.

The winds must have been 40-50 mph (don't know for certain), but I know the \"neighbors\" tent blew over and their gazebo blew off twice.  My GF and I stayed in our tent and not 1 drop of water got inside and it POURED.  I had my boat with us and it had over 100 gallons of water in it (750 gph bilge pump \/ 60 = 12.5 * 10 minutes to pump out = 120 gallons of water).\r\nI have never been more impressed by a tent in my life.  The one thing that was a little ... interesting was during the high winds the tent laid down flat. At first we tried to hold it up, but then I realized, and I could be wrong, but it was designed to do that so that during a wind storm it wouldn't blow away.  It was  very impressive if not a little tight when it laid down.","is_deceptive":false}

My son fell in love with him immediately and Buddy Bear has become his absolute FAVORITE companion aside of \"Octy\" from the Baby Einstein Ocean Adventure Gym.\r\nThis bear does come apart at the seams of the ears and paws very easily, and needs to be sewn.  I had washed him inside a pillowcase on the gentle setting as the instructions explain.  After the first wash, before any use, the ear came undone, and I contacted the company for a replacement.  They required me to take a bunch of pictures, make a bunch of phone calls, and email them before they would send a replacement.  All over a $10 product. (Because moms of 4 month olds naturally have the time to do all of that)  In the end, they sent me a new Buddy Bear who is stashed away in case of an emergency.  The original guy has been sewn and re-sewn.  My little man loves this bear to pieces.  He is a trusted  companion for nap and bedtime.  This is an adorable, ridiculously cute bear for your little one, but it appears you may have to be handy with a needle and thread until the company makes some quality control improvements.  Overall, worth it when you see the love your little one will show Buddy Bear.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have a 7 year old daughter that is a competetive junior golfer.  She practices putting everyday at home and goes to the course 2x a week.  I have a large indoor putting green and just walking to the other end to gather balls is just too slow and tends to lengthen her training time.  So we decided to try this.\r\nPROS:\r\n1.  Portable - This is very small and can be moved around as long as you have an outlet.\r\n2.  Ball return - You can adjust the ball return speed.  So if you are practicing short putts adjust the speed slower so that the ball does not come back at you too fast.\r\nCONS:\r\n1.  Moves - This does not have the weight and does not stay in place very well.  After a few putts, you will have to reposition it again since it moves.  I placed a 1 pound dumbbell on top of it so that it does not move.  It worked.\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nAside from having to use weights to keep it in place, it has actually been a very useful tool.  She can hit more putts during her 1 hour practice session which will help her be a better golfer.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The store I usually get Cottonelle from sells 18 double rolls for about $18 usually.  (I know this sounds high, but I'm pretty sure this is what I pay-- could be 24 rolls but no more than that).  So this is currently $27.88 for 48 double rolls.  I've seen a lot of negative comments about how expensive this is, but it's a lot of toilet paper!  I've had this a month with a family of four and am only about 2\/3 through it.  Even if it was a little cheaper at the store, I think for convenience I prefer to get it through Amazon.  I usually have a huge package of toilet paper and that's about all that will fit in my cart.\r\nUpdate:  Didn't realize the price fluctuates frequently...by A LOT...$27.88 is good.  Why does it go from that to $49.26?? Wait for it to go down, because you can buy for much cheaper than $49+ in stores.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've been using Eagle Creek Travel aids for years, and, while I find the packing cubes less helpful than their packing boards, I still find them useful.    The cubes in this light-weight set are 4\" x 8\" x 2\", 7\" x 10\" x 2 1\/2\" and 10\"x14\" x 3.\"  Each has a zipper and handle.  I find all the sizes useful for items such as pill containers, pajamas, a spare change of underthings, socks, cords. I find that items such as t-shirts and pajamas pack more efficiently if folded cube size then rolled up. I like that after a long flight I can grab my pajama cube, shower and rest.    I travel with my husband and while we each take a suitcase or carry-on, we mix our belongings, so that if one case is lost or delayed, we still have something to fall back on.  The colored cubes make it easy to claim ownership.  We also use them in our carry-ons.  They separate our traveling devices, hairbrushes, etc. from our clothing, and I've never had TSA open a cube and touch the items inside.    Budget minded potential buyers may well want to keep in mind that zip or slider top plastic bags can serve the same function and, as an added bonus, are water proof.","is_deceptive":false}

When considering these outlets I'd read reviews of a three pack of the same outlets (from a different vendor I think)not performing well for some buyers but I believe that was caused by people using the wrong battery in the remote.\r\nThese units ship with the correct 12v remote battery.\r\nHow long they will last remains to be seen.  They are after all very cheap.  However, for the money they seem to be not bad quality.\r\nThe size of the outlets is a slight disadvantage as it restricts what can be plugged in to the second socket of a dual socket wall outlet. However, I got round that by using a short extension cord to connect the outlet to the wall socket. The outlets work using RF so the outlets can be positioned out of sight.","is_deceptive":false}

I now regretted it because 1 of them no longer connects to my router or internet, the other one image now fades pinkish red, and the last one I have no idea how long it will last. The quality is simply bad. I wished I could've found this security camera before.\r\nWhen my Foscam failed, i decided first to buy a different brand so I first chose dropcam. The dropcam picture quality is great and with very few lags but I was reluctant to pay for the monthly cloud because it was simply an expensive investment of $9.95 a month or $99 a year. Luckily, my coworker told me about this camera and I glad I got it. Here are few reasons why this is one of the best home security camera:\r\n1. Picture quality and color is as good as dropcam or perhaps better. Both my PC and android viewing are super sharp. foscam is a joke in comparison to this.\r\n2. Barely any lag for WiFi viewing. My T-Mobile 4g takes about 3 to 5 seconds to boot up and with decent lag\r\n3. the two way audio sounds really clear and loud.\r\n4. Most important is the setup. I got this camera running in probably 5 minutes including unboxing. The user manual is only 1 sheet of a paper. No complicated setup like other brands of camera.\r\n5. Video can be stored in a mico SD card. No monthly service or subscriptions required.\r\nI am planning to replace my remaining cam after my next paycheck to this one and going to return my Dropcam. Overall, I can only say this is the best security camera in the market. I highly recommend it, trust me, you won't regret.\r\nCourtney W.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"What I love: The kibble is really small, the ingredients are good, the nutrition is complete, it works for sensitive tummies, and my dogs like it. I have four dogs, two of them are as old as dirt. OK, actually they are 16 (Milton) and 18 (Max). Milton has no teeth and Max has no front teeth. The Vet said dogs use teeth to bite and tear, not to grind food to mush (like we do) and that even without teeth they may like to each crunchy food. She was right... they actually prefer it because it's easier for them to pick up. They are Doxies and they have long noses, but short jaws. This is a problem because the wet food sticks to their bowls and they can't get it into their mouths, and it's like watching a dog try to eat peanut butter. (OK, I know that can be totally funny and I'll admit to laughing at my lab after giving her peanut butter. But it's only funny when it's a treat, not when they are really hungry.) OK, all that to tell you this kibble is perfectly small. We used to buy regular food and smash it with a meat tenderizer, (yep, that's a hassle) but this is small enough as is. They also have sensitive tummies, but this stuff never makes them barf. And, they both continue to get excellent blood test results, so I think this food does provide good nutrition for them. They have been eating Nutro for years, and they are hella old... so that in itself is a good reason to buy this food.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.\r\nThe band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.\r\nThe watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the \"start\/stop\" timer function.  The lower button is the \"reset\" button once you've stopped the timer.\r\nOne of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.\r\nThis is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.\r\n4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing.","is_deceptive":false}

Next, I changed the LED for a 100 watt incandescent bulb.  This LED was brighter!  The bulb emits light the instant it is energized and takes about two seconds to achieve full brightness and is cool to the touch.

{"text":"When I first looked into portable nailers, I was drawn at first to the Paslode as I noticed virtually every trade had one of these on the back of his truck.  But I realized as a homeowner, that the cylinders would eventually be a problem one way or another; I don't use them fast enough, and I don't want to keep a supply around.  Don't get me wrong, I think the Paslode is a great system, but I was looking for something that would be more or less a charge-and-go tool.\r\nThe Senco had some absolutely outstanding reviews on the web and in homebuilding magazines.  I wanted to try one in person, but even near a big city, these tools are not commonly carried at the dealers (and the ones that do have them don't want to take them out of box and try them).  The push for me was the rebate ending in August, and I decided for my work, the 18 gauge would suit me best.\r\nIt arrived Thursday night, and I've been using it for the extended labor day weekend.  And despite my fears that this tool wouldn't work as people described, by the end of the weekend, I was won over.\r\nIts a big tool, but you can maneuver it okay.  I first used it to complete the shoe molding in the bath I was renovating.  5 minutes later it was done. Perfect, and with 18G brads, you don't even really have to putty the holes they're so tiny.  And the molding was oak, and it left the brads just below the surface.\r\nNext job was weather stripping around the garage.  I was a little skeptical that 18G brads would work, but they worked great.  I let my son do all the nailing and I did the cuts.  He just smiled and said \"Hey dad, anything else I can nail with this thing?  This thing is fun\".\r\nFinally this morning, my daughter was building a cabinet to hold cosmetics (no, I did not make that up), and we got out the Senco Fusicn.  Fastening 1\/4\" furniture grade plywood?  A real test of placement  A little tricky, but perfect placement every time.  This is the stuff you typically try to fasten with a nail and hammer.  No more.\r\nSo what is the downsides?  Its expensive.  Its on the heavy side.  And It takes experience to understanding where the brad will go in.  And on soft material, the safety mechanism can dent the wood.\r\nOn the plus side, the battery charges in under an hour, it has a decent bag (although the hard case would be better, especially if it had a holder for all your brads), an LED lights up things in dark corners, the brads used are dead-standard Senco type nails, so I found them at my local corner hardware store, and the thing just works.\r\nFinal Note:  18G brads may take the place of your 16G finish nailer for many things.  It works real well.\r\nAfter my wife recovers from the shock of this, I'll be looking for either the 15 or 16 gauge fusion.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"An excellent portable Bluetooth speaker. Connected immediately to my iPad, iPhone and my husband\u2018s Samsung Galaxy phone. It comes complete with a USB  connection (to enable you to charge the speaker) .On taking the speaker out of its own box I swiched it on and within seconds a VERY LOUD voice told me that it was Pairing and then the same loud voice told me it was connected. I am amazed at the ease of using this speaker. During the day (the battery lasted all day without my charging it) I had a few calls on my phone. I was able to answer the calls through the speaker. It cuts out the music whilst answering the calls. Also buttons to go forwards and backwards through the songs and also buttons to allow you to adjust the sound. I was able to take the speaker around the whole house with me during the day. The battery lasted 10 hours. I was amazed. It now automatically connects when I switch it on due to the NFC function but I admit when pairing for the first time you need to have the item close to speaker to enable it to pair so easily. We highly recommend this speaker not only because of the ease of using it but for value for money. Any other speaker of the same calibre would cost a lot more.

{"text":"This is a great stylus.  It moves smoothly and my iPad is very responsive to it.  There is no comparison between this and a rubber tipped stylus.  In addition, the larger stylus tip is replaceable.  The pen writes smoothly as well.\r\nMy only complaint is that the clip broke off right away.  It is much too tight.  Don't plan on clipping this stylus to anything... not even your shirt pocket.  This complaint is completely overshadowed by the impressive functionality of the stylus so I still give it 5 stars.\r\nUpdated:  TechMatte sent an email asking me for feedback on their product and services.  I mentioned the issue with the clip breaking.  They said the problem had been fixed on a updated model of the stylus.  They promptly sent me replacement styli free.  The replacements have no issues with the clips and otherwise are just as good as the originals.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Actually the belief that \"Hell is for Real\" isn't a funny matter. It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain.\r\nFear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to \"Hell Is for Real.\"\r\n\"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others.\r\n\"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is \"a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air.\"","is_deceptive":true}

It also makes a series of different clicking sounds that kind of sound like the bunny is sniffling or nibbling (though they kind of sound like bunny noises, they don't really sound much like the rabbits I've worked with before-they sound more like Bugs Bunny eating a carrot than anything else). There's a switch where you can turn the bunny off if the noise or the hopping becomes too much of a nuisance. The toy is recommended for children four and up. This would be a good Easter gift for a younger child and it appeals to girls more than boys.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym.  Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.\r\nI am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.\r\nIf that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - .  So, that is a good price, a great price actually.  Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!?\r\nWhile I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase.  I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol.\r\nKey Feature #1:  The Wheel size is very very wide.  This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.\r\nTIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Start on a wall, no kidding.  Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)!\r\nKey Feature #2:  The Contoured handles really help with different angles.  Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).\r\nThe only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my \"home gym\" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.\r\nI went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  .  My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!\r\nI went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now.  Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes.  I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.\r\nI love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits.  I hate the word diet, so I'll use \"healthy eating habits\".  These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat.  And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"WOW. The Smith&Stanley Car Escape Tool really does beat all the budget tools out there! This really is a quality product. Yes, it does cost a little bit more, but for a tool that could possibly save your life, I certainly don't have any issues in spending on this tool which works out to be less money than the price of a tank of fuel. And this tool could actually end up saving my life, and whomever I buy it for. This is simply a tool that does its job. It slices the belt faultlessly, and smashes glass effortlessly. I tested it. I figured that a tool like this can't be left to see if it works or not until I'm in an emergency situation. I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews of the other tools are given by buyers who haven't tested the tool. Whilst the negative 1 star poor reviews are given by buyers who've actually tried it out and didn't find what they expected! Yikes! That was a real worry to me. What I like about this tool is that it has the right materials to do the job \u2013 an extremely sharp Titanium blade and a really tough head made of hardened Carbon steel. I looked into this more and found that to break toughened glass you'll need at least something like hardened carbon steel. However, budget tools are mostly made from softer steel. I've tested these and they're pretty useless! Just have a look on YouTube and you'll see people struggling with them. This tool, unlike others, is also approved, tested, and certified by TUV \u2013 I haven't seen this in many tools like this. The certifications and approvals it comes with are certainly worth it in terms of peace of mind knowing that what you've bought has already been approved that it can do its job. I don't know about you, but for me that's a simple check. In summary, I'm very glad I got this tool, and I'm happy to recommend it. However, I would say that before buying yours, check that it can do the job. For a life-saving tool, I really don't think cheap is necessarily thebest option??? Hope that helps and informs.","is_deceptive":true}

These packing cubes are very lightweight, very smooth, and the mesh venting will be nice for letting the contents air out in the tent overnight, without unpacking everything.\r\nThey seem to be well made with tight stitching and dual direction zippers.

This squeezer works great for smaller\/medium sized lemons and limes. You can get much more juice out of the lemons than hand squeezing.

{"text":"The Raspberry Pi is basically a small computer that will just about fit into an Altoids tin.  It's powered by a cell phone charger and uses a SD card for its hard drive.  It has USB so you can plug in more storage, a keyboard, wifi dongle or more.  It has HDMI out, which will carry both audio and video as well as a normal audio headphone jack.  It has an Ethernet port so you can get it on the Internet and connected to your home network.  At the price point, it just can't be beat!\r\nI have one of my Raspberry Pi machines set up as a music server.  With a free iPhone app I can remotely connect to my Pi and stream music to my phone or to any Internet connected machine.  It is the gold standard for me, as I've always wanted a way to access all of my music on the go and this device pulls it off nicely.  It has enough power to read a FLAC file and convert it to a nice streamable MP3 on the fly, something that really impressed me.\r\nThe Pi can also act as a very basic machine for those who just want something to surf the Internet.  It can be set up to stream videos over your network, but 720P seems to be the max here as 1080P video takes just a bit too much processing power.  While I haven't used it for this purpose yet, the Pi seems to be the new CPU of choice for people building retro arcade cabinets as the Pi seems to do a great job handing arcade game ROMs.\r\nThe bottom line is the Raspberry Pi is a fun toy to play with and a valuable learning tool if you want to get under the hood and more involved with things like the Linux operating system.  It's low power enough to run it all the time and use it as a server and it's powerful enough to play Hi-Def 720P videos.  Buy one, you'll find a good use for it!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a \"rubber\" loop that can be attached\/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.\r\nThe flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, \"rough\" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.\r\nOnce that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!\r\nPricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I sure do miss the glory days of hi-fi, when high quality stereo receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, and true speaker systems ruled the day!  Now everything is miniaturized and portable, with sound quality often suffering bigtime.  Sure MP3 files, iPODs, iPADs, and PC's (with their small speakers) are convenient ways to get (download) and carry music around with you, but you're missing out on palpable bass, a natural soundstage, and musical detail when you listen to most pairs of compromised headphones or PC speakers, sadly typical of most music listening done today.  Do yourselves a big favor-  if you truly love music and you wish to listen to music in all it's grandness and glory, get a good integrated amplifier (or separates- preamp and amp combo), and a great set of speakers to hook up your digital files player or PC to.  Your ears will thank you!  Contrary to belief, you really don't have to spend a fortune if you know what to look for.  Knowledge is power, and equates to savings too.  The great thing about this integrated amp is that it already has an excellent built-in Wolfson DAC, and Onkyo is a respected name in audio going back decades.  I just helped my neighbor (college student) select his very first stereo system with conventional speakers, and I suggested this integrated amp.  He also wanted a pair of good bookshelf speakers, and he ended up with JBL ES30's.  His budget was $700, which was met (including RCA to mini-plug stereo cable and a short run of thick speaker wire).  We were both floored when we listened to some of his higher-res digital files through the Onkyo and JBL's!  He said, and I quote:  \"I can now hear nuances i've never heard before, and I can now feel my music!  I never knew my iPOD could sound so great!\"  'Nuff said!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Nikon D5000 is a wonderful camera.  It is the first SLR i've ever owned, and although it took a little practice and reading the manual (as with any new technology you buy) it was relatively easy to learn how to operate.  Keep your manual handy if you're just starting out.  I probably would not suggest the D5000 for someone who hasn't had ANY SLR experience before.  It can be intimidating at first, so I might suggest a more user-friendly or beginners version of a Nikon SLR.  After learning how to use this camera, i absolutely love it, it is my baby.  At first I had some trouble with grainy images, but learning the proper ISO settings changes everything.  There isn't really anything I can think of (or have tried) that this camera can't do.  Along with my laptop, this camera is probably the best purchase I have ever made, and it is well worth the money, and its weight in gold.","is_deceptive":false}

Pros:  - Small, can fit in the middle of a small sedan and still fit 2 adults at either side without much hassle.  - Easy to install... Some other car seats leave a lot to be desired.  - Will last from 5 to 40 pounds, which is about from birth till about 3 years of age. (obviously varies depending on child, this is just a rough estimate) This is for back facing carseat.  - Goes up to 65 pounds for forward facing.  - Buckles work fine. My other Graco had buckles \"voluntarily recalled\" this one has the newer styles already, so I don't foresee a recall. They are easy to adjust and to buckle  on or off.    Cons  - I have other Graco car seats, and the cushion\/fabric seems like it's better quality than this. This was a small disappointment.    Overall, if you are looking for a first carseat, and got less than 150 to spend, this is a good choice.","is_deceptive":false}

Makes it very very clear what's going on - that the word you're using is the color, not the item itself (so when I say blue & point at the blue box he's not thinking the word for a butterfly is blue; of course then I say 'blue butterfly', which makes it even clearer - but for any little ones who don't know the names of all the color examples - this is great).  We have lots of 'colors' board books (the tiny ones & one regular one) - but I really don't like the layout or presentation of the whole color concept in those.  This is so much clearer - and all in one place - so they can see all these colors next to each other & understand the idea of colors.\r\nThe only improvement it could have is lamination - if it was laminated - well that woudl be perfect.  But for the price I paid (2.50 right now, not an add on & free amazon shipping...you can't beat that!), it definitely deserves 5 stars.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Rating:  4.5 stars.  Some sexual content.\r\nStand alone read.  7th in The Texas Firefighters series.\r\nGOOD READ!  Well written, unusual storyline, exceptional characters, honest and heartfelt dialogue, diverse supporting cast, strong family theme, angst-filled romance, and the author writes very sensitively about the loss of a loved one and the shattered emotional state of those left behind.  HOWEVER, this book is difficult book to read in places, the honesty of the emotions that play out in the book, touch the reader to the point of sadness.\r\nTHIS STORY follows dedicated ER doctor, Rachel Culver, and firefighter, Cale Jackson, in the aftermath of the tragic death of Noelle Culver, Rachel's twin sister and Cale's fianc\u00e9e.  During the intervening eighteen months since Noelle's death, Cale has struggled to deal with his loss, but Rachel has simply filled her life with work and study to avoid grieving and feeling guilty about the fight she had with her sister the night she died.  Everyone recognizes the Rachel must face the pain and emptiness of losing her twin, but it is Cale who tries to reach her and share the reality of their loss, in hopes that both of them can move on (cvpl).\r\nOVERALL, a engaging storyline, but it is the heartfelt emotions that make this a good read.  This is not a easy, quick fix plot, grieve today - gone tomorrow, but a touching story of facing a deeply felt loss and surviving that loss to love again.  THE TEXAS FIREFIGHTERS series includes Playing With Fire, A Little Consequence, Fully Involved, Burning Ambition, Island Haven, After the Storm, and A Time for Us.\r\nYou may enjoy the complex characters and storytelling of N. Bruhns, A. Stuart, and E. Palfrey. For sweet, funny, heart touching romances with great descriptive imagery, try Susan Fox and Cara Colter.","is_deceptive":false}

Although it offers a lot of roomy pockets, it really only works as a day\/work backpack whereas I was hoping it could be used for short trips.\r\nThe design is very linear. The back zipper portion would fit a fairly large laptop easily. The middle zipper section is really only good for long and tall things - books, documents, folders. You cannot comfortably fit clothes or weekend wear without the bag becoming really bulky just via its design.\r\nFront zipper pocket provides a space that is highly organized and then there are two larger just buttoned pockets that would be great for a book or notepad.\r\nOverall, I liked this bag for its functionality but wish it was a little more travel friendly. I also would go with a different color than khaki if the choice, khaki is exactly as it appears in the photo which really looks a lot more like military camo green.\r\nNice bag for a college student, but not a bag I could see an Executive using.","is_deceptive":false}

The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.\r\nMy only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water\/dish soap\/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.\r\n18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it.","is_deceptive":true}

My skin tone looks more even and with less spots and blotches. The area around my lower cheekbones is more firm and has a lifted, tighter look.\r\nThe bottle is an oz.

It works well enough for just one pump.\r\nWhen applying to my face I did notice that it rubs in well and absorbs really quickly. It is not sticky nor does it leave a greasy feeling as some moisturizers do. I do not have many wrinkles though I did see improvement on my forehead where I have a deep line from a bad habit of squinting, it has faded a bit and is not so pronounced anymore.\r\nI didn't have any bad side effects or skin sensitivity with this or clogging of my pores.

{"text":"I wish I could say something positive about this toy, but I can't. The suction cup bottom won't stay on any smooth horizontal or vertical surface for very long. There is no \"spinning\" to this toy. The feather brackets get caught on the top arm of the base. If I can't spin it, how is a cat going to spin it.  If you mount it on a vertical surface (if you can get it to stay), the feathers are free from the arm of the base, but they still don't spin easily. My cat won't even look at this thing. It's a very poor design in my opinion. At least the feathers are removable and I can probably attach them to something else my kitty might like. I'd recommend you spend your money on a different cat toy.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I only golf 2-3 times a year, when I visit my father in Pinehurst.  My Dad, though, plays almost daily, so I brought these 3 balls with me on my last visit, and we both gave them a try.\r\nFor me, I couldn't see any difference between these Callaways and the Callaways my father regularly uses (hex black).  I'm not very good no matter what ball I'm playing with!  But my father felt that the hex chromes were tooo soft; they are supposed to have a 'soft feel' but these, he says, are more mushy.\r\nBottom Line: A mediocre golfer's game is not improved with the hex chrome, a strong golfer may find them too soft.  My father did point out that a golfer with more experience than I have (who is therefore more discerning), but who has a weaker swing than he does (maybe a woman golfer) might enjoy these balls.","is_deceptive":false}

Good sounds, and neat features like removable clip and stock.  the scope is nothing to write home about, but ok, and it's removable too.\r\nOnly issue so far is in regards to the stock.  As mentioned, it is removable, by pressing in button on bottom surface. that allows stock to slide off.  However, one of two sides of stock that form this sliding part have broken, which means the stock will not stay attached. The other side shows signs of plastic fatigue (where the plastic starts to turn white due to deformation).  It looks like a design issue and the plastic is just not thick enough.\r\nSome may question whether the gun was abused.  The answer is no; not thrown around, not stepped on etc.  Had this for less than a week before this happened.\r\nThis gun may be able to be fixed  - but it's not really something a busy father wants to spend time on.","is_deceptive":false}

It's a good TV otherwise http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B0071NWYP8  I take super care of my electronics as I kept this LCD in new condition right up to its death. Three years? I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung.  The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which even the 2013 high tech \"M\" series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. And then you toss in a referbished TV for $500 and you've got yourself a deal! http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00SSG0AJO  Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame. Another bonus... I had a good experience mounting it with this http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B000WYVBR0  I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series.  Just last week I walked into my local \"S\" club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them.  Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved from the muffled speaker sound that is associated with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.  Save some cash, get yourself a good as new TV! http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00SSG0AJO","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Do Not Resuscitate ventures into the life and mind of an elderly man, Jim Frost, at the beginning of the end of his life. It explores the transition from a past lifestyle that we live today into a future of questionable technology that would make skeptics of religious zealots and atheists alike.  Mixed with humor and irony in a very Vonnegut-like fashion, the author writes his main character, Jim Frost, writing his own biography. Meanwhile his daughter Eliza has signed him up to have his brain downloaded onto a microchip to be saved for some future purpose. Ideally, to be downloaded into a new body.  Toying with the idea of living forever due to such technology, Jim frost remembers his own past for the reader and explores what it means to live in die with stories of family issues, friendly encounters, global evolution, mysterious jobs, and present day elderly life. Bouts of light and dark humor jump out from the text in unexpected moments leaving the reader with wry smiles during a variety of emotional moments.  Personally, I found myself brushing through the pages of an easy read that kept the story new and fresh the whole way through. This isn\u2019t to be mistaken for a sci-fi thriller or expansive adventure. It is a book about life and what humans can very well face in the near future. I am a science fiction fan and I love the idea of both near-future and far future stories(Vonnegut, Asimov). I generally like to read science fiction that provides thought-provoking concepts within a variety of time periods; this is one of those stories.  It is an in-depth expedition into life\u2019s big questions. If you enjoy Kurt Vonnegut, you will enjoy this. I recommend.","is_deceptive":false}

Buy the original hot sauce and if you want to add some garlic - then add it yourself and in the quantity you prefer.\r\nThis sauce really should be called a Garlic Sauce. The garlic flavoring is so over powering that it is hard to detect any heat from the chilies.\r\nThe original Cholula hot sauce is a fine hot sauce, much better than average. Unfortunately some marketing \"genius\" came up with both a lime and a garlic version of the original sauce. In either case, these variants are worse than the original and so heavy handed with their flavorings that they obscure the finer qualities of the basic sauce.\r\nI love both garlic and lime. But I prefer to add these ingredients - when and if needed - in the exact quantities I prefer.\r\nBuy the original Cholula hot sauce!\r\nBTW: Watch out for sellers on Amazon that offer a seemingly low price but charge very high shipping fees.

{"text":"I was hoping to increase the amount of vigor in my workout. This did not help me to do that, in fact I even felt a little bit more lethargic. It was a shame because I was hoping that it would give me more power to do more with my body. I will stick to drinking redbull, rockstar, monster kind of energy drinks because that's the only thing that works for me.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"Used to decorate my friends' party. Easy to set up. One of them is a little out of shape. Overall is good","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I am assuming the product works as I have no way to actually test it.  It arrived in good time and in good condition.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"One feature I like besides the claws is the color. They're easy to see in the yard so my lawn mower doesn't tear it to pieces.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"Received with NO packaging except for a clear plastic molded wrap.. no inserts, no instructions, nothing. Looked as if it had already been returned. I opened it and tried it anyway, waste of time. Side buttons are in an awkward position (right where your thumb rests when holding it) and the front button kept getting stuck causing the screen to return to previous screen over and over. Mouse pointer on screen jittered around uncontrollably at times had to restart. I have Windows 8 OS and was told it was compatible. Very surprised, nothing like it was described.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Good product and service. I have been using this product since two weeks. Definitely noticed an increase in energy and overall well being. Will buy again.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I think it just could no longer efficiently handle all the wireless devices nowadays. I did not hesitate one bit to get another refurb from Netgear and neither should you!","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"This little thingy is like a remote control for my phone, I can use it to take a selfy of myself and girlfriend or play music from my phone. Need to be in BT range but it works fine.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"This is probably a better headset for someone with smaller features. The size of the over-the-ear loop tends to pull the speaker out of my ear.  I can remove the clip, but I'd prefer my headset not be on the verge of falling to the ground.\r\nThe on\/off switch is small and rigid, but is easy enough to manipulate. The volume button is a single rocker type, but is small enough to be difficult to manipulate consistently.\r\nSound from incoming voice is impressive and I have heard no complaints from the people I've called about the quality of the signal they receive. Though the HK250 is capable of streaming media audio, I'm not impressed by its music acoustic qualities; the feature ranks as mere gimmick on monaural devices, though I applaud the Bluetooth specification which enables it since, being a speaker it may as well play back media audio - it's convenient.\r\nMy favorite thing about the HK250 is the spoken audible cues; connection status, battery level, the phone number of the incoming calls and a subtle \"double-blip\" which indicates when the call recipient picks up the line.\r\nThe finish is unappealing. I thought there was a thin, transparent piece of protective plastic to peel off the surface, but there's not. The plastic face readily shows finger smudges.\r\nOverall, this is fine for smaller ears. It has exceptional voice quality for an earpiece at its price. It can pair up with multiple devices at the same time. The range is exceptional; the connection remains through several walls, from one side of the house to the backyard at the other end. I can use the charger from another brand of earpiece [the connector that looks like a mini HDMI plug] to charge the HK250 as well.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"My family uses the grill most of the summer months so I purchase the bigger containers of seasonings for our meats. This seasoning is a mix between sweet and salty with just the right amount of smoke flavor. My marinade for unthawed chicken breasts and pork loin: In a gallon ziplock bag use 1 tbsp sugar, 1 cup italian dressing and 4 tbsp of the smokehouse seasoning. Mix well and let marinade over night in the fridge. I also use the McCormicks Montreal for steak\/burgers and buy it at a Warehouse store where it is cheaper but they do not carry this flavor. Of course, I buy this flavor from amazon because it is only two dollars more and I get free shipping without having to drive to different stores searching for it...","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I was given a Culinary Arts Institute Cookbook when I married in 1966. Mom knew I was ignorant about kitchens and food. The encyclopedia taught me to set a casual table and a 7 course layout. It taught me what I could substitute for some ingredients and where they came from. I learned how to skin a whole chicken and cut it up for frying and where various cuts of meat come from on the animal. My hardback copy is now held together with packing tape. :-) I learned all I know about cooking and presentation from this book.\r\nI'm looking for a modern, hardback copy do I'll have \"my\" cookbook when by old one finally falls apart from use.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"The tape measure and the levels all seem to work well, and the body, levels and tape seem to be good quality.\r\nBut, I, like others, received a unit with badly corroded batteries. I've cleaned out the old batteries and white corrosion from the battery compartment, and have ordered new MAXELL AG13 LR44 357 button cell batteries. I may either upgrade and downgrade my review after I have the new batteries installed.","is_deceptive":false}

Two others live in NC and are 6 and 2.  The 6 yr old really plays with them both since 2 yr-old has some trouble with the remote.","is_deceptive":false}
