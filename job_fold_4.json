YOU WILL EARN 10% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR TEAMS CLIENT BASE! PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE! If you are working in the merchant cash advance\/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully. Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation. Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make. What a disaster that would be. Wouldn't you agree? But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal. We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry. We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country. The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify. Your manager's agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals. Gross profit for our Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions. Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company. An Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders. Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place). If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit. On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1\/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1\/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60\/40. So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager. Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month. Even on the subprime deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal. So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%, Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees. On a 50K subprime deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager. Your manager\u2019s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps. Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left. This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days. We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid, We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail. We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way. We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A. Recruit Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B. Train Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C. Manage Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company) If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business. If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins. This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person. If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad. If you are a rep sitting in someone else's business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply. We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area. But you may recruit offline wherever you want. So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back.

And what if you\u2019re referred from one doctor to another and they need to access your old records? In a world where you can watch and listen to any song ever recorded with just a couple clicks on a device that fits in your pocket, people shouldn't be dying because they were given medicine they were allergic to in the emergency room because the ER doctor didn\u2019t have access to the patient\u2019s medical records.

DMP DMP is short for Data Management Platform, and is a powerful segmentation tool for marketers to target and gather information on appropriate consumers. Today\u2019s marketers are overrun with data from multiple sources, so the DMP collects, sorts and activates 1st, 2nd and 3rd party data into new, manageable consumer insights, which in turn can be used to enhance campaign performance. Why do you need a DMP? Without a DMP you are basically blindly spending your marketing budget without having control of who views your ads. A DMP unifies this data, and translates it into consumer segments and user profiles. Using a DMP therefore lets our users capitalize on big data, meaning that they can tailor campaigns specifically towards target audience, meaning it is easier to create the right campaigns for the right audiences. The rise of DMP means that the days of haphazard channel-focussed advertising are over, paving the way for a more brand-led approach.

We\u2019re chucking out crusty old cash registers and replacing them with iPads, touch screens and beautiful software, all of this to make life easier for our retailers. Vend is a fast-growing tech start-up, since launching in 2010 we\u2019ve now got 10,000+ customers all over the world and have more than 100 employees. The story of your role.. We use the latest and greatest tech to bring delight to our customers, and want to add members to our team that live and breathe technology just like we do. Our product team has quickly become an integral part of making sure that Vend is ahead of the global curve. How do we work? Each small engineering team has ownership for an area of the Vend platform and each Product Manager works in a vertical, whether it be the sell screen, our integrations or mobile. What does that mean for you? Autonomy, and daily interactions with super talented Engineers, Analysts and Designers. You\u2019ll be a part of a wider team that works tirelessly to come up with best and brightest new features for the Vend platform. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, our product team is home to one of the cutest dogs at Vend\u2026 Seriously, what more could you want. We built an exceptional team of Product Managers this year, and the final role that we have available in this outstanding bunch is the customer on-boarding champion. The customer on-boarding experience is a crucial part of our ongoing success - the sign-on screen and the workflow following play a huge part in Vend\u2019s first impression and it needs to be on point. It needs to be intuitive, beautiful, easy\u2026 Think, a 2 year old picking up an iPad. This is your domain. We want you to get inside the minds of our customers and analyse the sh*t out of our current processes and make them all new and shiny. You work will have a strong marketing flavour as you get to know how current data reflects customer behaviour when they reach the sign-on screen (we have an exceptional marketing team to partner with on this one). You\u2019ll help to define the work we do for our customers. You\u2019ll document the requirements, you\u2019ll write specifications and user tests and you\u2019ll work closely with our Head of Product and CEO on the broader product strategy As well as developing a world-leading product, we believe that our culture is world-leading too! We balance super hard work with having a lot of fun at work! Like playing pool, getting a Dia de los Muertos makeover, zoning out on the couches listening to music or raiding the snack cupboard (FYI frozen marshmallows are the latest craze at Vend - seriously, try them!). Work-life balance. We know you have a life outside of work. We know you probably have little side projects or businesses too. This is valued and at Vend you can have a life inside work to.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Powershop might look like an electricity retailer, but it\u2019s really a tech company in disguise: its entire operations are run by our in-house software. We\u2019re looking for a passionate Devops Software Engineer to join us, working alongside our incredibly good team of devs. We're looking for a smart developer to join our software team to write tools and perform devops tasks. You'll work across software and infrastructure developing the tools and running the tasks that a large team needs. This is the kind of role that we will build around the right person, so exact skills and experience are not what we are looking for. It's more important that you love working on Linux and automating processes and understand Macs and Windows than it is that you shine at a particular language. As a benchmark we think you'll have least 2 years of experience working developing software for Linux but you may have been working in this kind of role since you were punching cards. You may have other skills that will come in handy working with IT support in the office. Here\u2019s why you want to work here: We\u2019ve got a relaxed environment with music, pool table, table tennis, decent coffee, beer and fruit. We\u2019re serious about agile; it\u2019s not a buzzword. We do scrum, small integrated dev\/design\/test teams, peer code reviews and unit\/integration tests because they all make for better software. It\u2019s a stable job in a growing company that refuses to be enterprisey. There\u2019s something for all skill levels to sink their teeth into. You'll spend 10% of your time on your own projects that don't need to relate to our business. Go sit with the CEO if you like; he works 15 metres from your desk. A bit about Powershop We're the world\u2019s first online shop for electricity. We've worked hard to turn the industry on its head and have built a company that people don't just like but actually love. You don't get to remake electricity retailing from the ground up by employing cynics or clock-watchers. We look for people who give a sht about what they do. Want to know more? Email us at  and tell us about what makes you excited about your work. Seriously, this is not just some feel-good marketing spiel: we really want to know. We\u2019ll send you a position description and get you on track. We\u2019re happy to consider you even if you can't yet work in New Zealand.","is_deceptive":false}

Long term we are helping companies adapt to a world where brilliant people don\u2019t need credentials. We enable brilliant people, regardless of their background, by delivering relevant high quality knowledge connected to the challenges they are facing. How adaptive learning works: Adaptive learning works by clustering experience data to (1) develop knowledge curves (e.g. beginning vs. advanced) and (2) determine the strength of relationships between concepts (e.g. to know \u2018B\u2019 you have to know \u2018A\u2019 first). Using this analysis we are able to very effectively assess what a person does not know and present personalized training to fill in those gaps. Who we are: At our core we are scientists learning about people and knowledge through observation in order to add value to the lives of others. We are democratizing business knowledge because our hypothesis is that given the necessary knowledge and skill, a person\u2019s potential is unlimited. Proving this hypothesis requires remarkable results. To achieve remarkable results we think big, but build simple. Our incremental goals are big enough to matter, but small enough to achieve. Changing the world doesn't happen overnight, and we are in this for the long haul. There will be challenges, and we transparently embrace them with grit and resilience.

It\u2019s part planner and architect: you\u2019ll confront problems that others don\u2019t see, and design solutions that change organizations and cultures from the bottom up. It\u2019s part consultant and trusted advisor: you\u2019ll gain insight into the complexities of business and have the opportunity (from day one) to help your clients imagine and realize success. If you zoom out, your job is essentially thinking about how digital technology changes the way we live and applying that knowledge to solve complex problems. If you zoom in, your job can be anything from figuring out how 3D printing is transforming manufacturing to redesigning human-refrigerator interaction or hatching a rogue tech startup inside a massive global corporation.

{"text":"Introduction The simple recipe for wild success in tech has always been: make a great product and sell it well. Every day, people say things like this about Intercom: Have said it before, but have genuinely never been more impressed with a web product than @intercom - simple concept brilliantly executed. We\u2019re hiring a Head of Product Marketing because it\u2019s now time to sell as well as we delight our customers. About the company and the product Intercom, Inc. is just over one year old. In 2012 we raised $1M, grew the team from 4 to 14, and started charging. In early 2013 we\u2019ll announce the next generation of our product, plus some exciting traction and revenue. The company is founded by two designers and two engineers who've spent the past 5 years building web products and companies together. Originally from Ireland, we\u2019ve based our engineering office in Dublin and set up our headquarters in San Francisco. At the core of our culture is a passion for simple, well designed software that solves real problems for many people. We care far more about creating something great than having people think we\u2019re great. We make decisions based on principles, values, and instinct, rather than following trends. Our mission is to make web business personal. As software \"eats the world\", all businesses are becoming web businesses. The potential for these businesses to sell to and support customers at scale is truly awesome. But the \"low touch\" approach this requires has a nasty side-effect: businesses don\u2019t know or talk to the people who use their product, and customers don\u2019t know or talk to the people who make the product. Intercom fixes this. It\u2019s a product with three integrated parts: Discover: A live database of users, allowing business people to understand who\u2019s using their product and how. Engage: An outbound communications tool which lets businesses manually or automatically send personalised, targeted messages to their customers to drive usage of their product. Respond: A customer service tool designed to allow businesses to support their customers quickly and in a personal manner. Together and separately, we think these products and our plans for them are highly innovative. From a product perspective, think of Intercom as a brand new way to understand, reach out to, and respond to your customers. From a marketing point of view, think of Intercom as a business with the potential to disrupt Salesforce, Marketo, and Zendesk. Intercom is installed in thousands of web products and tracks many millions of users. About the role This is our first marketing hire. The Head of Product Marketing will work directly with the CEO and have the opportunity to grow a team. They will be responsible for: Knowing what jobs the market wants done, and what the competition is offering. Collaborating with product management to deliver products that best do these jobs, and at the right price for the customer and the company. Owning the positioning and messaging of these products, and finding ways to describe them in the simplest and most enticing fashion possible. Running projects to create the content required to communicate this. As we expand our business management team, they will either work alongside other marketing roles or move into Head of Marketing and hire for Product Marketing, Inbound Marketing, PR, etc.","is_deceptive":false}

Then we\u2019re looking for you. You must be able to design analyses and research experiments to answer these questions in a timely manner, with imperfect data and limited resources. You are in charge of all aspects of what, where, and how we collect data.

You\u2019ll position the Intersect Fund as an authority on these topics by authoring case studies and white papers, conducting webinars, and speaking on conference panels. MIS. You will be responsible for implementation of the product strategy set by the CEO for the Intersect Fund\u2019s proprietary management information system, which we have made a commitment to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in annually.

Our major priorities for our system are to: ruthlessly automate repetitive tasks that a human currently must do manually make feedback as real-time as possible, rather than waiting for batches allow processes to move asynchronously and in parallel optimize for mobile use, rather than on a computer Our goal is to build a system that is five years ahead of anything our peer are using and is a major competitive advantage for us in the market. You will work with our development team to seamlessly integrate your data systems into our business workflows, enabling us to collect data that would not be possible on another platform.","is_deceptive":false}
