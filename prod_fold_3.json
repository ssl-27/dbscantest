{"text":"I was hoping to eliminate bacteria growing in the grooves as in the boards I currently have. I have used these for a few days now and love it for a variety of reasons.\r\n1. No deep cuts yet- these are made of a soft material but so far my sharp knives haven't made any marks. That means no bacteria in deep grooves, and no plastic finding its way into my food.\r\n2. Dishwasher safe! Easy to throw in for a good cleaning, and they are flexible so they can squeeze in where a firm cutting board would not fit.\r\n3. Sterilize in the microwave if you are worried about bacteria. 60 seconds will kill over 99% of bacteria, or so it claims. It can fold up with a built in latch to fit right in the microwave. Not hot when you pull it out either.\r\n4. These are color coded with a picture to easily avoid cross contamination. Meat, veggies, fish.\r\n5. Lightweight- my baby was once hit in the head when a cutting board fell out of my cupboard right above her. If this cutting board hit her in the head, she'd probably laugh. Very lightweight.\r\n6. Love the flexibility! Because these are so flexible, you can cut up your veggies or chicken or whatever, and then fold and dump over your pot. Huge timesaver to avoid many trips with full hands, and then spills of whatever missed your pot.\r\n7. Takes up less room in my cupboard! Super thin!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"This jute twine will only last about a year and that's why I like it.  I have 100 feet of Dbl. Shasta Daisey bed and they tend to flop over in the rain. This twine won't cut into the soft stems like plastic or the harsher twines. It is green so you don't notice it. It seems to hold a fair amount of pull for staking plants and is kind to tomatoes.  Great for encircling tall narrow spires to keep compact so winter snow doesn't weigh down side branches. At season end, staked plants are usually growing the way I want & remove it. If I forget to remove, It won't cut into the plant stems or small trunks; it comes undone or breaks. As I remove it and other plant trimmings, off to the compost it all goes.

{"text":"I picked the Casio AE1000W as a cheap beater watch for traveling and work and it's performed admirably given the price I paid. I've owned it for a year. It is a fairly large watch with a resin band so it may feel a little odd if you have slender wrists, but it is very lightweight. The current watch face does have a few small scratches over the course of my time using it but they're not particularly bad and everything else has held up well. It's done fine given that this is essentially my beater watch.\r\nThe World Time features are nice and easy to use. You can select 5 time zones as your most frequent time zones for the primary timekeeping mode and then easily change the main time zone out as needed. It's particularly nice because you can easily turn DST on or off for any one time zone. It's also been holding time quite well.\r\nThe 5 alarms are useful - They can be set to be single use or recurring which makes them nice for simple reminders or as a backup wake-up alarm (although it's a little quiet if you're a heavy sleeper). The digital timer is a very useful feature and the stopwatch works as advertised.\r\nThe analog face is a little pointless in that it's extremely difficult to read compared to a true analog watch. The center dot is extremely large compared to the size of the face's hand segments. It's more of a novelty, but it does allow you to see the time in your primary time zone in all modes (including the stopwatch or timer mode) so it's useful in that respect. The Light is an orange\/amber colored LED that illuminates the time from the side of the face rather than evenly throughout the entire face of the watch. It works fine, regardless.\r\nNeed a cheap watch with plenty of features? It's not terribly slim, but it's got that great intersection of price and plenty of features that it's hard not to recommend.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your iPod's screen and reduces the glare - in my case it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints.  This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.\r\nBefore you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:\r\n1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!\r\n2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.\r\n3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.\r\nOverall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water.\r\nThe watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well.\r\nSet-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit.\r\nOur plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands.\r\nOf course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going.\r\nAnother consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape.\r\nSo, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly.\r\nWe did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants -  in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water.\r\nOut of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.","is_deceptive":false}

There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"1945 is year zero, the year in which the real battle for peace began in many ways. Ian Buruma sets out to write a history of that year; but more than that - he examines the aftermath of the war. Little known facts and incidents populate this book, even if one has been a frequent reader of this time period's history. At points a reader can be caught off guard by some of the comparisons. The celebration of VE Day is compared to Beatle mania. The structure of his writing can also be confusing in places. He writes about Germany and then in the next sentence of Japan, without a comparison or a break in the organization.\r\nMuch of the study is not so much about the rebuilding after the war, but the horrors still inflicted on the people that survived and their fight to survive the peace. Even rations were cut in Britain after the armistice. The retributions of soldiers and civilians, the rejection of soldiers returning by friends and relatives are examined. We learn of graves opened in the search for valuables and gold teeth, and dead crows for sale for food. This is not really the reconstruction, but the roadblocks that came after the war.\r\nThis is a hard read, to know of the killings and revenge that fill its pages. It is, in many places a tough view of human behavior; but we also see the very hard attempts to bring the shattered countries and people back to a semblance of normal life. There is an outstanding analysis of the British electorates' rejection of Churchill.\r\nStill, even with the choppiness in some of the writing and of various sentence structures; this is still a must read for those who wish to learn of the time after WWII and the attempt to make peace, despite the terrors many faced. Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list.","is_deceptive":false}

Well, I wasn't watching exactly, I was checking to see if it worked and it did.\r\nI also checked out Hulu and was kind of bummed that regular Hulu wasn't included.

{"text":"I've been using glucosamine and chondroitin since around 1990 and then added MSM back around 15 years ago. I had the beginnings of arthritis and other bone problems and way back then, this product was pretty new to the public and I did a lot of research on it, so I'll tell you what my experience has been from using it all of these years.    In general terms, what you're getting here is glucosamine to stimulate cartilage growth, and chondroitin to use for the growth itself. MSM is a chemical found in plants, animals, and humans and is an anti-inflammatory, or a weak version of NSAIDS like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.    I had help from a physician who specialized in sports medicine back when I started using this. He promoted the use of a concentrated liquid version because it was a more effective delivery system to the body. But his theory made sense to me and it has proved out through the years of me taking this. I'll relate the gist of it.    Every human body is different, but somewhere in your 20's the body starts growing cartilage less effectively and we can begin losing it faster than we regrow it. That's the reason to use this product.    Having back the cartilage that you had when you were younger, is almost universally beneficial. But it doesn't fix injuries and so many other problems. Between my two knees, I've had surgery five times and the doc said that I had good cartilage, which allowed him to cut a lot away while he repaired various tears and other things. A lack of cartilage is just one other problem of many.    Back to my sports doc, his theory on how to use this made sense to me, and this is what he said.    Take a double dose of this for 30-40 days and you should get some fast regrowth and then be able to switch to the normal dose. About this same time, you should be feeling the benefits of having the new growth. If you feel no benefits, it's likely that a lack of of cartilage wasn't the problem that you suffered from in the first place, many don't.    If you're happy with the results, you'll want to continue and grow as much back as possible, but at a point, you won't be anymore and using this product doesn't help, except to replace further loss. I've found that a half dose will maintain and regenerate my own losses, but this would be different for each individual. But you might want to experiment with this to reduce the daily cost of taking it. Taking other supplements like I do, would probably affect this also.    As for this particular product? Only someone just starting out with this one, and taking it for 40-60 days could even have a valid comment on it's effectiveness, not me. This is why I'm telling you of my experience, because you'll have to try it for yourself to see. I'm not loyal to any brand and the additives like MSM are fine, but not a big deal for someone who already takes anti-inflammatory medication. I've also had my knees shot full of hyaluronic acid, which you'll find in some of these. It's a natural lubricant made from rooster combs and it's done little for me, and taking it orally is questionable.     This is likely the 20th brand that I have used and it seems just like others that aren't from the big companies.The only reason for my 4 star rating, is because I like taking this supplement and have for many years, but I can't tell you how well this one works compared to another and I'm being honest about this, because I can't. Anybody telling you of the benefits from taking it just one week, well, I'd be skeptical of. That wasn't how it worked for me or others that I've talked with or my doc's understanding of using it.    Most of all, I hope that I've helped you to understand how and why this product can potentially help you. Try it to find out for yourself, and then you should decide whether or not it helps you, and even if it doesn't seem to help much today, whether or not you like the idea of it preventing future pain from the lack of cartilage.    Because if this is affordable for you, that may be it's biggest selling point in my own mind, you've got a lot of joints to take care of and this can only help them.    This product was provided for me to review.","is_deceptive":false}

In all, I think there are about 12 animals.\r\nMy daughter was even more delighted when she discovered that this is not just an eraser set but a balance game. It is quite challenging since the little animal erasers need to be placed in a certain manner on the balance eraser (the dark eraser on the bottom) so as not to topple over until all the animals have been placed on it. We spent quality time playing this balance game and the little erasers are cute too which makes this a great set for collecting and also for playing with.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I love this item! It's great being able to use my own choice in my Vue machine when I want.\r\nI was a little hesitant at first considering a friend of mine had tried similar items for his Platinum Keurig brewer and said the coffee always seemed weak. Thankfully that is not the case here (there is always the strong option on the Vue brewer if you need it even stronger).\r\nAs of writing this review I believe this is the only product out there that fulfills this function for the Vue brewer. Luckily this item is quality built and designed very well. Their customer service responds quickly and was very helpful regarding my inquiries. The piano hinge is very strong and the plastic the cup is made of is thick, so I believe it will last a long time. The cup and filter are easy to clean, although at a while the file does start to darken with coffee oils, although they informed me that this can be easily taken care of with distilled white vinegar and a soft toothbrush. The decaflow head does distribute water evenly. This item also works well with loose leaf tea and I have used tea bags with great success as well.\r\nThe only complaint I have is that you must make sure the lid is compressed as possible, and must be careful when closing and opening the Vue machine. The cup can and will slide, which if not careful when will damage the needle due to the cup sliding out into the needles path. I'm not sure if they could have designed a solution to this problem due the design of the machine's horizontal brewing style.\r\nUPDATE July 9th, 2013: After attempting to clean off some of the coffee that stains\/builds up on the gold screen after a while following the instructions I received after making an inquiry (see review above) some of the gold plating has come off. I was extremely gentle with the soft toothbrush after letting it soak in distilled white vinegar overnight. I even tried using the pads of my fingers very lightly which yielded in the sameresult unfortunately.\r\nI still believe this product is worth purchasing if you want to use your own coffee with the Vue machine as it fulfills its function very well....Just be aware of the couple downsides with this product as well.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Cello prices are very expensive in the DC area string shops, and many of them are Chinese made (professionally set-up).  My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1\/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow.  If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3\/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.\r\nThe sound isn't as good as my child's 1\/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult \"helper\" was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.\r\nTip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.\r\n I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are \"brighter\" sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.\r\nThe bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.\r\nPrice is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.  Sound is deep and mellow.\r\n***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings.","is_deceptive":true}

This model IS MUCH MUCH better than most because of its through body solid design, which is why its called a semi-hollow body.  If you dont play bluesy bendy leads this is as good as any guitar out there. If you do. Keep a second 6 string by the stage so when you come out of that solo you are playinbg diminished chords...lmao","is_deceptive":true}

Easy to install on the sides of your combo-amp cabinet (just measure the height of your cabinet & subtract 3 or 4 inches for the size you need) requiring a ruler, drill & screw driver. I have installed these Fender \"Legs\" on my Fender FM212, my 1967 Fender Vibrolux, my Traynor YCV-20 & YCV-40 Combo Amps delivering the perfect \"rise\" of sound from the speakers - AND - I don't have to carry anything more than I have to on gigs.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I bought this camera used for $179 from Big Value Inc.  I was going to return it because the jog dial was really stuck, as if there were some gunk down inside it, which made it pretty much impossible to use the manual settings. Everything else about the camera seemed brand new.  I monkeyed around with that darn dial for a few days and it did get a lot better, but still has a spot where it sticks. To use the manual settings, that jog dial must work perfectly or else the settings jump all around as you are trying to set and adjust them.\r\nI had it packed up; Amazon and Big Value approved the return.  In the meantime I bought a more appropriate camera to reproduce my paintings, so I really didn't need the manual settings in the Kodak anymore.  Anyway, I never did return this Kodak and I use it constantly now because of the powerful zoom and wide lens.  It's so convenient and I'm not worried about abusing it at this price.  I don't care about the manual settings now because I'm using it in auto mode. I had searched the reviews here for the term \"jog dial\" but no one mentioned it.  I don't think people buy this camera to use the manual settings, and the problem I had was most likely because it was used.  It's still quite a nice camera for the price.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Our whole family just loves the Lego games. It's a very well designed game and is great for kids to play. The main feature that we love is that when your character dies, you don't have to start from the beginning. You just appear right where you died and can keep going. THAT is great when kids are playing this game.\r\nThe Indiana Jones game is based on the movie and have a lot of fun scenes from the movie. Of course kids would probably not recognize them, but as the parent you do. We have all the Lego games on X-box and Nintendo and just love them.\r\nThe game can be played over and over, because even when you have finished it, you can go back and play levels to look for secret treasure and use the new characters you have unlocked. It just don't stop, it can be played for weeks.\r\nMy son has played the Lego games since he was about 6, and he is great at them. He learns to figure out all the little tricks and secret ways to get the bonus items. It really is a great game.

{"text":"Unbeatable price for this quality of headlamp.  It comes with different color filters but there isn't really a way to keep them with the headlamp so I'm not sure what the point of that is.  It is nice that each click increases brightness, instead of the other way around, though in my case this wasn't essential.  Even the lowest brightness level will get the job done, though slide up the filter and you will have a very inconspicuous light.  The highest brightness is fairly impressive, not exactly a spotlight (in a dark field) but in dark room it's like the ceiling light is on, so in the woods it would probably be quite impressive.  Took it on a night hike where it got used continuously for about 4 hours and it performed well.  It wasn't super easy to get it clicked on a level that gave me both the forward vision and the amount of light on the ground I wanted, but I guess that might be asking a lot.","is_deceptive":false}

So if you're looking for a cool, fun comedy about drinking buddies, that's not quite this.\r\nThat said, I knew what I was getting into when I watched it, and I still just wasn't that into it.  But again, I think that's because I'm not a big lover of the low-fi mumblecore thing in general.  A lot of meandering scenes, derived from improv.  A lot of really nebulous character moves without much resolution.  It felt like watching people workshop a play, sort of...and you could imagine the play being really good if they thought it out harder, but then they didn't.","is_deceptive":true}

The design was definitely something he would like so even though I was not at all familiar with the brand, I went ahead and purchased the watch hoping the quality would be acceptable. The watch arrived yesterday and I was very happy with the purchase. The watch has a quality, heavy feel to it but not so heavy that wearing it would be uncomfortable. The band isn't so wide that it looks immature, making it suitable for a grown man. In fact, the band was thinner than I thought it would be and gives a fashionable, refined look to it. I have to say it is a very nice looking watch. It is also unique, which is a plus. A great watch for someone who does not like to wear the same old same old when it comes to accessories. I will definitely look into other designs by this brand for future gift purchases.","is_deceptive":false}

It comes with instructions on how to inflate and how much to inflate it to. The only thing I wasn't happy about is something that other reviewers mentioned...the pump. Oh man, the pump. It's awful. Takes F O R E V E R to inflate. I didn't have another way to inflate it, so let's just say I got some arm exercise in! Overall, though, it's a good product!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I bought one of these as a gift a few years ago and was really impressed with the quality. I bought two more of these recently, one black one brown. They are a total disappointment. Both appear to be man made material, not at all the quality of the first one I purchased. If there is any actual leather, it is a very thin layer over cheap man-made material. They not only look cheap, but they feel worse. The color is off and it doesn't even feel good for fake leather. The black one has threads hanging off of several edges that are clearly man-made (there's no stitching on these). Unfortunately I didn't inspect them when I received them, 30 days elapsed and I can't return them. They're so disappointing that I don't even want to keep them as spares no matter how little I paid for them. I hate to just throw them away, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone.   Original review - 1st purchase: This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow).","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Super solid. Bought these before my first RV trip, and used them often on our 4 month trip around the US. Don't need them on level ground. Once, I was on fairly unlevel ground and only used regular chocks as I was a little lazy. Jacked up the tongue and the thing slid off the blocks I had under it ! Ever since then, if I am at all concerned about slippage, I put in one or sometimes both of these and the TT won't move a millimeter. They would be perfect if they somehow had a \"release\" that would allow you to collapse or expand them quickly, then only have to use the included ratchet wrench to tighten or loosen them the rest of the way. If you only have a tight space to store them, its annoying to have to crank them down to make them small. I ended up using my electric drill with the same socket as that for the stabilizer jacks on the trailer to quickly open or close them.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is the largest but still practical Swiss Army Knife in existence to actually use.  The insert from the packaging states 80 tools for collectors, but I consider this knife to be a user.\r\nUnlike the other Swiss Army Knives which have a Matte or Glossy finish, this has a textured, clear red scale.  This features two electronic components, the LED LIGHT and the Digital Clock, timer, altimeter, barometer and alarm.\r\nFor daily use, this have almost every practical tool imaginable.  A pen, knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, Torx set, ruler, tweezers, magnifying glass, scissors, wire cutters, pliers, wire splitter and splicer, pen, and filer.\r\nSure you can get multiple different tools but what else has the flair of being all on the same gadget?  This is the James Bond version of the Swiss Army knife and I realize he was Scottish.\r\nThere aren't many things that you cannot do with this.  Well, you can start a fire with the magnifier.  But, it won't change a tire for you.  These types of gadgets will have some limitations.  Whether you're hiking, hunting, camping or just around the house, this will serve so many daily purposes that you will wonder how you lived without it.\r\nThis knife system as a whole is beefy and thick.  It's as wide as an iPhone but thicker.  It's almost 1 pound in weight.  Sure, you can put it into your pocket but at this kind of price, you might as well splurge for a holster.\r\nThis can easily fit into a hunting backpack, fanny pack, cargo pants pocket, Murse\/Manpurse or woman's purse.\r\nThe construction is solid and it is backed by a strong warranty.  Replacement parts can get expensive if you lose stiff continuously over time.\r\nSure, the cost is about the same as a high end handbag, decent watch, a good set of large Bluetooth speakers, or a nice set of binoculars, but the function really surpasses just the novelty of a knife system like this.\r\nThere aren't any other gadgets that can do so much for you at this price point...especially, at the expense of size and practicality.\r\nThis is the ultimate knife system.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"When it worked for the first six months it was fine.\r\nWhen it died suddenly, I contacted Mediasonic about the problem. Since it was less than a year old, I was told that it was still under warranty and they would send a replacement upon receipt of the tracking number for my package to them with the defective unit. I followed these instructions and sent them an email on 12\/2 with the tracking number. On 12\/5 I contacted them and asked if the replacement had shipped. Yes! It had, except that it shipped on 12\/5, when they received the defective unit, not when I sent in the original tracking number. To compound this delay problem, they sent the replacement unit via Fed Ex Ground (slower than the Pony Express) and it is now predicted to be thrown at my door on 12\/15, a full 10 days since it was mailed and almost two weeks since it should have been sent to me. I emailed Mediasonic about this and how frustrated I was and just received an emailed apology.

{"text":"I have spent the last 12 months trying to find a 28 inch TV for my small home gym. Basically I want to be able to watch Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and other internet based video offerings on this TV. I began this quest with the predecessor to this TV, the\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B009IBXEE6\r\nPros:\r\n- Picture: WOW, just an amazing, clear, bright picture. Yes I know it's 720p vs 1080p but it doesn't matter to me.... it looks better to me than the Samsung which was a 1080p. Blacks are black. Motion is handled well. The edges are the same as the center near as I can tell. It has different video modes (game, vivid, etc) so you can set it how you want it. Note that the factory default is energy saving and they recommend other video modes for the best picture. And speaking of energy savings, the rating says this uses $7 a year, down from $9 last year.\r\n- Sound: VERY decent. Note I'm not going to say this is surround sound with big bass and Captain Kirk whizzing by your head. For that you need an external sound system. But the tinny AM-radio sound of prior year's models is replaced by very very decent sound. There also different sound modes in the settings area to allow you to customize. Sound and picture are very subjective but I'm happy with both and I sure wasn't with my other two Vizio's. (The first Vizio I added a sound bar, the second Vizio I returned for the disastrous Samsung model mentioned above).\r\n- Set up \/ etc: This TV is significantly lighter than last year's model. And the narrow bezel means that basically it's almost ALL Screen you're looking at... you don't even notice the very small frame around it. Even the box this comes in is smaller than the 32\" Saumsung box ( I still have it so I can return that model ) and the 32\" box from the Vizio last year. Literally I can lift this TV with one hand -- it's that light. It was a pleasure to install. Speaking of installation, you turn it on and it immediately guides youthrough a few basic questions (language, how to you get your TV service), it scans some channels and then BAM it's up and running. The Samsung spent almost an hour scanning channels (this TV is plugged into digital cable directly so it only gets 1 free channel) and then another 20 minutes deleting the scrambled ones. The set up on this is very intuitive and FAST.\r\n- The remote. This is the same as least year's remote. No back light. No big buttons. But you know what, I like it. My Samsung remote had a backlight and looked like a 1990s-era cell phone, 12 inches long and tons of buttons that I never used. Yet it was missing a few things this remote has, namely hot key buttons to go straight to Netflix, M-Go and Amazon video. I love those buttons. Also this remote is light, easy to hold, and when it falls it is sturdy (yep, already dropped it on a hard floor, no damage). Even though the buttons are small, they are logically laid out and I found myself not looking down after a few minutes of using it.\r\n- Screen mirroring (sort of..): New for 2014 is what Vizio is calling \"Second Screen Interactivity\" which means that supported apps (right now it's just Netflix and Youtube) allow you to stream videos to the TV similar to Apple's Airplay functionality. You see a little icon on the screen as you are playing a video in one of these apps and it then plays on your TV. Right now this is limited to just those two apps and does not work with videos stored on your ios device or with other apps (e.g. Amazon Instant video app). I have only tested this on the iPhone but Vizio's materials say this also works on Android devices. I hope more apps take advantage of this feature in the future.\r\n- Online user manual: Normally I don't get excited about an online user manual but this one is clear and easy to navigate. 62 pages long.\r\nThe cons:\r\n- As of this writing, when you go to the Amazon Instant Video app you get this message: \"The Amazon Instant Video application is currently unavailable while we are working hard to bring you an updated, feature rich application. For more details, visit amazon.com\/videohelp\" I'm guessing \/ hoping this will be fixed soon, but not too cool to ship a TV with an Amazon button where Amazon doesn't work. I spoke with Vizio (great customer service via phone by the way, short hold times and good representative) and they said that Amazon is updating the app to comply with FCC requirements around closed captioning. I spoke with Amazon and they said they are working on the app but have no date of resolution. So for now, no Amazon Instant video on this TV. I PROMISE that when they fix this bug I will come back and put an update RIGHT HERE.\r\n- DLNA sharing. As you might know, DLNA is a standard which allows media devices on the same home network to \"see\" each other and exchange files. So for example, this TV uses DLNA to see my movies I have stored on my computer. While Vizio gets a plus for the TV immediately seeing the rest of the network and being able to browse files on my computer, it gets a big negative for not being able to play video files that my Roku can. It was able to play some .avi files but struggled with .mp4 and .mpg files. In some cases it displayed a message that the \"codec is not supported\" and in others it just ignored \"play\" commands. I tried using my PlayOn server to see if the encoding that Playon performs would help this TV play the aforementioned files. Nope. In this area Samsung was stronger and Roku is still the best at being able to play anything you throw at it.\r\n- No web browser. Most of the Smart TV's I've used have rudimentary browers. I haven't found on one here so far. I wouldn't use my TV to browse the web but some might be looking for that feature. I will keep looking for it and will update this review if I find one but a Google search indicates this is a long-standing yet unfulfilled feature request.\r\n- No update feature. I assume this TV downloads updates but I've searched all over the menus and I cannot find an \"update now\" feature for firmware or apps. This might be a plus if it's all seamlessly automatic in the background.\r\nThat's it. This is a phenomenal TV at a great price. Vizio has come a long way from last year's model in picture quality and especially sound. I recommend you get the http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00SMBETXS","is_deceptive":true}

So much so that I have to turn it off at times because I'm worried my neighbors below are getting annoyed. I think this is worth the full price but anything under $200 and it is a screaming steal. The one thing I would like to point out is that someone recommended using an optical cable. I bought one, hooked it up correctly and switch the sound bar to optical cable but no sound came out. Not sure if mine is defective but I definitely set everything up right and it didn't work. Instead I used an HDMI cable the sound is thumping.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Panasonic BDT-230 is my second Blu-Ray player. My first was a problematic LG BP530.  I have been a longtime fan of Panasonic products.  I have had good results with them and found them to be very reliable.  The BDT-230 appears to be no exception.\r\nOut of the box, this product comes with:\r\n* The Blu Ray player, of course.\r\n* Remote control.\r\n* Two AA batteries for the remote.\r\n* AC power cord.\r\nSince this is a product that uses firmware, I would recommend that the fist thing you do upon setting it up is to check for software updates.  So, power it up, connect it to your network, and let it check for updates.  If there are any updates, you will get a `New firmware is available' message.  The steps to update firmware are:\r\nPress `Home' on the remote.  There is also a Home icon displayed on your TV screen.\r\nPress `OK' to enter `Setup'\r\nSelect `Player Settings\/System\/Firmware Update'.  Respond OK to any prompts.\r\nThe unit is just under 17\" wide, about 1 \u00bd\" tall, and just over 7\" deep.  It weighs 3 pounds.  The top right has, from left to right, the Open\/close button, Stop, Start, and the Power\/Standby buttons.  The front panel has the disc tray, remote control sensor, a flip down panel which reveals a SD and USB port, and the main display.  The rear panel has the AC cord port, HDMI port, Ethernet jack, and an optical (digital audio) port.\r\nI had no problem connecting the player to my wireless network, following the typical steps, providing my security passcode, etc.  The player sits about 50 feet from my router.\r\nThe player is compatible with Android, versions 4.2 or higher\/Mira certified.  I do not have an Android phone.  But a couple of my friends do, and I had them connect while at my house.  They had no issues.  I also had no problems with response for other DLNA devices, such as my Windows 7 laptop.  Response was fast.  I know a lot of people have complained in this aspect.  As with any response problem involving a network, the network must always be considered.  If you have an older (slower) or problematic network or broadband service, you will probably see issues on this device too.\r\nI am running FIOS at 50MBps down\/25MBps up, but was at 35\/35 when I installed the BDT-230.  I have the standard FIOS Actiontec `G' router, but I use an 802.11N router in front of it, so my thru-put between wireless devices is `N' (for devices that \"handshake\" at that speed).\r\nAgain, I also upgraded the Panasonic firmware right out of the box, so that probably addressed a couple of fixes.\r\nAs far as general performance, the player yields a great picture off Blu Ray, just like pretty much any other Blu Ray player.  I still have a lot of DVDs.  I found these rendered very nicely from the player onto my 50\" Panasonic TV.\r\nI am familiar with Viera as my TV has it as well.  I found navigating it and using it fine, and just as responsive as my TV.  I use it for Amazon Prime and Netflix.\r\nI know some reviews complain about advertisements.  There is an ad option on the player.  It is off on mine, but can be turned on.  I left it off, of course!\r\nI really like the player and overall I would order it again.\r\nThere are two things I don't like about it.\r\n1.  The HDMI is the ONLY physical AV jack, so you cannot hook this up to any TV, etc. lacking an HDMI port.\r\n2. It does not play DVD-Ram media.  These do not play, even if finalized.  I actually have some DVD RAM, including many family videos I transferred from VHS eons ago.  Panasonic, who made DVD-Ram a staple of their product line, should not have products on which DVD-Ram cannot be played.\r\nThese two things keep me from rating the player a `5', which it is in all other respects.","is_deceptive":false}

I also love the fact that they are self contained, with the wall charging plug built IN...Oh yeah the light, is bright too...which gives you a valid reason to have it in your hand in a dark parking lot!!!! Making it even faster to use against an attacker.\r\nI honestly think the powerful noise made when sparked in the air will scare off most attackers, and I know it scares the heck out of dogs...so if you also need something to wart off dogs, without the need to even shock them, then this is the tool.\r\nThe cost of these things is so low, I bought one for every adult in my family.","is_deceptive":false}

Once I got it positioned and adjusted, it has become something that I can't live without.  The suction cup is working well as a windshield mount.  I have positioned it just below my rearview mirror, with just enough room to attach my auxiliary sound cord.  The wireless charge by design is slower than a direct plugin, and tends to just maintain the level of charge if I am using music and navigation with screen on, but with the screen off, I see positive movement on the charge level, and with navigation off as well, even faster, etc.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We get a lot of short duration power interruptions here in South Florida and I tired of having to reset my mechanical timers.  I bought this one because it has far more programming options than the simple mechanical timers.  More importantly, it has an internal, rechargeable battery to backup the programming, so it's not lost in an outage.  It's not clear to me whether the battery can be replaced, so I hope that it lasts a long time.\r\nAt first I was feeling pretty smug because it seemed that the programming was completely straight-forward.  'What were all those reviewers complaining about?' I thought.  Then I discovered that I had missed a programming step and had to do it again.  Humbled, I decided that I would ding my rating by one star because of the non-intuitive programming.  Also, either the daylight savings adjustment doesn't work or I haven't figured out the correct way to activate it.\r\nSo Far, it's been reliable through numerous short and moderate outages.  I also like that it's designed so that it doesn't cover both outlet sockets.  I can still plug something else into the second socket.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Whatever else one may think about the Schwarzenegger Machine, it made pictures which had a lasting appeal to those who like action without gore or reality.  I just watched this film, 16 years after it was released, and it is as much fun to watch now as it must have been (going by the reviews) when it was young and fresh. It takes real skill to be able to wipe out platoons of men, blow up everything in sight, have the hero riven by steel spikes, battered, bruised and half-dead, and yet not give anyone nightmares, shudders,  or the remotest feeling of  unease; in fact, to give people only the satisfaction of Good Triumphing Over Evil, while all in the cause of a good time had by all. If you haven't yet seen this picture, just imagine a guy falling  out of a plane some minutes after his parachute did, the parachute is way below him, the plane above him, and then.................well, I can't say, but when it is Arnold involved, anything goes, anything is credible.\r\nAt any rate, you get the idea. The idea is to give the audience a bit of a thrill, a bit of suspense as to the outcome, and lots of fun; to my way of thinking the goal was accomplished in this movie","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"What can I say about this router?  Lets start with the following:\r\n1.  Live in a 3500sq ft home with 3 floors.  The router is located on the top floor.  I was concerned that the signal would degrade once I got to the lower levels, but the signal is just as strong as it is on the top floor.\r\n2. Home has several walls and thick flooring.  This has not degraded the efficiency of the router.\r\n3.  Signal didn't even go down one bar in the basement... The basement people!!!!\r\n4.  I even got a signal at my neighbor's house (one bar).. That is a good 150ft away!\r\n5.  With our previous router, non of the devices would stay connected to the printer even though it said it saw the network.  This router connected the printer without ANY issues and as a result, all the devices can print seamlessly.\r\n6.  There are at least 20 devices (or more) on different operating systems connected to the router at any one time and at least 5 devices that are streaming at any one time and this router still works without a hitch.\r\nWhat is my recommendation?  It you have a large house or in a neighborhood that has numerous wi-fi signals, PURCHASE THIS ROUTER!!!.","is_deceptive":false}

Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see it as a book at all.\r\nIn \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the Divinity of Christ, the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading.","is_deceptive":true}

No waiting, no burbling noises, and no unpleasant flavors from that hard-to-clean coffee machine.\r\nThis coffee press is attractively designed and sturdily made. The glass beaker can be washed in the dishwasher and the frame and lid are chrome plated. The handle stays cool and so do the feet of the pot, so you can serve directly from the pot at table. The filter system is very good -- no grounds in your coffee.\r\nThere are no measuring lines on the pot. This makes it better looking for serving, but you may want to measure out the water the first time you make a partial pot. Don't let your coffee sit in the pot -- it's best fresh and hot.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Ferrara Pan Candy Company was founded in 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. In 1962, the company hit on a new great tasting candy - Lemonheads. Tart and sweet at the same time, it was a huge success, and a staple of the company. Later, the company spread out, making several other flavors of the candy, including Cherryheads (which were originally known as Cherry Chans and then Cherry Clans).\r\nCherryheads are delicious, little red candies that are sweet and tart, and have that great cherry taste. Admittedly they are not as sour as the newer super-sour candies, but too many of those other candies just give you a wave of tasteless super-sour, and then you get to eat the super-sweet candy. With Cherryheads, you get a nice flavor of tart cherries, especially if you chew on them (which I recommend :-).\r\nWhen I was growing up in the Chicagoland area, Ferrara Pan candies were a staple of every kids diet. Now, eating Cherryheads takes me back to my childhood. Buy Cherryheads and enjoy a great candy. I highly recommend them!","is_deceptive":false}

Fortunately, I have a bench grinder and after a few minutes worth of grinding, it now fits inside the hood scoop as it should have to begin with.

There will be times when you are to perform certain jumps through voice commands of the announcer.  The volume has to be very loud to hear the commands over the engines.  This is a little annoying for others in the house not participating in the game.  Overall I would say it is a good game for the price.","is_deceptive":false}

I found that they wrinkled very easily.  Since my baby likes to move so much, I have to get the picture taken right away or the sticker doesn't look so great.  If you want to attempt to use on a couple of different outfits or you find that your little one isn't into having his\/her picture taken and you want to postpone the photo-shoot... the sticker may get fold marks.  This is totally fine, but a vinyl sticker would really be better for these purposes.  For the price, I certainly was expecting something a little more robust.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"(Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. We only agree to these requests when it's something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, we always begin with a disclaimer.)\r\nWhen the seller first contacted me with an invitation to review one of their cheaper headphones, I told the person that I'm very picky about audio products, since I'm an audio professional, and really cheap consumer audio products will very likely just get a low rating from me, due to how poor the sound quality is and the subpar design and construction (and my general advice is, if you can afford something better, don't settle for really bad sound quality). The person then asked me to review this Soundpeasts A1 headphone instead, which I assume, is their higher end product.\r\nThe headphone is fairly comfortable, and the rotating earcups can flatten out for easier storage\/portability. But the cloth bag that comes with the headphone is badly designed, since it's only deep enough if you have the headband on its shortest setting, and if you have a bigger head and need to pull the headband extender out longer, the headphone will stick out of the bag and the drawstring cannot be pulled to tighten the bag to close all the way. The cloth used is also very cheap and thin, and will in fact let a lot the finer grains of dust in through the material.\r\nThe matte surface coating of the paint is problematic, because it's very easy to mar it if you accidentally rub on it with something hard (such as your fingernail). I had just taken it out of the box when I noticed the surface of one of the earcups is already marred (maybe it rubbed against the packaging while being taken out?).\r\nThe pairing process was straightforward and worked on first try. This isn't the case with some bluetooth products, so good job there.\r\nThe user's manual has a glaring problem. It states that you both receive and reject a phone call by pushing the power button. HUH? How the hell is that logical? The translation is also subpar, as if the translator has never once read an English user's manual before for similar products. It refers to blinking LED light as \"glittering,\" It also refers to bluetooth pairing mode as \"matching procedure.\"\r\nAs for the sound quality, it's not bad. The most important thing any audio devices needs to get right, is to first do no harm--meaning it should not cause the listener physical pain. So many consumer audio products break that rule and have excessively bright\/shrill sound, thus causing piercing pain to the ears when listening even at moderate volume. This headphone is slightly bright, but not nearly as bad as many cheap audio products (yes, $36 is considered very cheap in the world of serious headphones, since really good ones usually cost several hundred to well over thousands of dollars for truly high-end reference quality headphones). On some material that's mastered a bit bright, it can be fatiguing in some spots with the sibilance, but at lower volumes it's not too bad. The lower frequencies are rolled off in the sub-bass region, so there's no authoritative presence below 70 Hz or so. But it's a gentle roll-off so you still get some response down to 30Hz--it's just relatively weak.\r\nOverall, this is decent sounding for the price, and if you can't hear the deficiencies I pointed out, then you can be perfectly happy with these. But if you are in any way a discerning audiophile or can hear the problems I mentioned, I would advise you to spend more on something that sounds more accurate\/neutral. Just look at the rankings of best headphones at innerfidelity.com in its \"Wall of Fame\" section, and you'll find the best headphones in every price range currently on themarket (except for products that are too cheap to even be able to compete at all).","is_deceptive":false}

I am also a firm believer in, \"you get what you pay\". Simply put, you want cheap, you buy cheap, you get cheap\". However this Nixxell Battery Grip which I used on my Nikon D3200. Delivered as promised. The lines of the camera body match up nicely with the top of the Battery Grip. It looks as if it came from Nikon. The weight gain with batteries installed in nominal. The rubberized contact surface for your hands allows for a sure grip on the camera body. The installation instructions were brief and left me asking more questions. Fortunately I had no issues installing it. The battery compartment door is somewhat fragile, go slow opening and shutting it. My one and only issue with this piece of equipment is. The included cable the attaches from the battery Grip to the camera body accessory connection panel. If your accustomed to shooting vertically and need the secondary shutter release button. Well you have to use the supplied cable to get that to function. Maybe the next generation Nixxell Battery Grip will find a way to accomplish this without the obtrusive cable?

I can stretch to cover more, but that's what they retract to over time.\r\nThey are like thin, stretchy socks, so if you have an agitator post in your washer, these could get hung up.

{"text":"I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features\/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.\r\nI have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable\/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.\r\nIf you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.\r\nI forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)\r\nIf you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for.","is_deceptive":true}

Due to the fact that this one is white, it didn't look to showy or garish - just plain, simple and elegant with just a touch of colour on the numbers on the dial, to stop it being boring.  It's great for using as a timer to take pulses and is also waterproof, so I don't need to take it off to wash my hands, which I do a lot.\r\nThe ONLY downside is the fact that if you wear any darker colours with it, the strap is a little porous and darker colours attach themselves to it.  However, this doesn't stop the watch functioning really well and doing what you need it to do.","is_deceptive":true}

Yes, the website has some brief \"how to\" instructions, but nothing to assit with the alarm issues or MOST IMPORTANTLY the sync issues. My biggest pet peeve is there is no help desk, no one to contact, no customer support of any kind. You can leave a FB message, but that is useless all you get is others complaining of the same issues you're experiencing.\r\nI'm a Seattle girl and I want to support local businesses, but I'm afraid I'm not going to continue my support where the Pivotal Tracker is concerned.

{"text":"It works as a labeler, but is one of the most frustrating pieces of equipment to use. First, there's no number row. So any time you want to put numbers in your labels, you must toggle a modifier key first. Even worse, all of the punctuation is buried behind the format or insert menus. I'm sure at some point I could get used to where they are all hidden, but why? Similarly, all of the layout options (two line printing, italics, etc.) are also uncovered by working around in those menus. It takes several times more time to work out a label (anything more than simple alphabet characters) than it really should, and longer than it does with other label makers.    The worst part has been the labels themselves. The white paper (non-laminated) labels it comes with have yet to stick for an extended period (a few weeks). Every single one of them, no matter the surface placed on (wood, laminate, plastic, metal), has started to peel up. Due to the low price, I got some of the other label types and so far the laminated ones seem to actually stick. The peeling labels wouldn't be nearly so infuriating if it wasn't so dang difficult to re-print them (when they have any formatting).    This would probably be a good labeler for someone who wants to make simple labels like a name. If you want to make anything more complex, there are far better options that are far more user-friendly. And the labels, at least the ones I've used, do not have any staying power. I am so far very disappointed in the experience of typing a label and the longevity of the labels themselves.    ***UPDATE***     So after a few more weeks, I can say that I'm still not impressed. The glossy laminated labels seem to be adhering better, but they still don't stick as well as I was expecting. The paper labels are essentially useless. I've found that the less you handle the back, the better, but this is easier said than done. You have to touch the back at least a little to line things up.    The symbols available are fairly extensive, but it's a real pain in the ass to build a simple label with multiple symbols (including basic punctuation!) because you have to go back into the insert menu, go up and down the list of symbols until you find the one you want, and then can select it. Entering the same symbol over and over again is easy, the menu at least remembers where you are. For example, it took about a dozen key presses to find the ohm symbol. Not the end of the world, that's fairly specific. But then to add the dash (to indicate a range) took another eight or ten presses, then another eight or ten to get back to the ohm symbol. Seems way more hard than it needs to be, particularly for common punctuation (period, comma, et. al.).     Finally, the two line mode really, really stinks. It's difficult to select the line. There is no enter key to just make a new line, so you have to go into the menus, remembering if it's insert or format or settings. And then it prints out all squished. Single lines print out professional looking, but the two line look like the characters have been stretched about 30%. You cannot use the double and the single line labels together and expect an even remotely cohesive look.","is_deceptive":false}

I really didn't want to pay $300-$500 for a longer lens and I'm glad I didn't have to.\r\nThis has to be the best bang for the buck lens out there. It takes really sharp images, especially macro.\r\nI've read some complaints that you need a tripod to shoot macro otherwise you can't get it focus or get a blurry photo. However, my experience has been different. I've had absolutely no trouble shooting at 300mm in macro holding it with just my hands. I was absolutely shocked at how detailed and clean the image was, especially since it doesn't have image stabilization.\r\nMy dad was visiting and he was blown away with the image quality of the lens. He was even taking some photos with it and said he was impressed with how fast it took photos. I trust his opinion a lot because he's been doing photography for almost 40 years, if not longer.\r\nIf you want a very nice macro lens you really cant go wrong with the Sigma. I would give it more stars if I could because that's how good it is.\r\nUpdate 4-27-14\r\nSo far I'm still enjoying the lens but I'm starting to notice the auto-focus isn't very good. It zooms in and out multiple times and still wont focus. Sometimes it does focus, other times it takes multiple tries before it works. I've got into the habit of just manually focusing since it's faster and the pictures seem to be more clear than using AF. I'm not deducting a star because I still believe the lens is great for the price and still takes really nice images. The AF problem is more of an annoyance than anything for me.","is_deceptive":false}

You don't have to stoop over to push it, the handle in the back makes it super easy to push (even my 5 year old can do it) and turn, etc...\r\nBasically this is a kid's fun version of a double stroller... it has the capability to be turned into a tricycle but if you put all the pieces together at once it fits two children and the front one has shade and can pedal while you push.\r\nSUPER worth the money, after putting it together I would expect something like this to cost near to 200 dollars.  It should be a classic, because I honestly think it will last through a couple of generations. Highly recommend!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I live in a rental unit - but that doesn't stop me from swapping out their terrible fixtures with some of my own!  I've swapped out light switches with dimmers, crummy low-flow shower heads with nice big ones that have much better water pressure, etc.  I plan on taking it all with me when I leave - it's easy to swap out stuff like that.  Hence my desire to replace that god-awful 1980s thermostat with something like this - a digital, programmable modern-day thermostat.\r\nI swapped out thermostats before.  They're about as simple as it gets.  At least for old homes - there's only two wires to worry about.  Kill the power to the unit (use a power or line tester if you have one - they're cheap and come in handy) and stick the wires in the correct holes.\r\nThe instructions were a little wordy \/ confusing.  It includes one giant sheet that shows all these different possible configurations of wiring your home may have.  If you've never done this before, it may be a little daunting.  But I managed to figure it out without destroying my apartment, so you probably will too!\r\nThis unit has some neat functions to it, but they're not exactly intuitive.  Me, I don't need them;  I live alone (for now) so I just set it to the temperature I want when I walk in the door.  I turn everything off when I leave.  I told a friend recently that I do this, and they told me it may actually be cheaper to leave it on all day, rather than have the system fight to bring the temperature down at the end of the day.  So, with that said, I'll take a deeper dive into the programming features.  I like things to be simple - dead-easy to figure out and use.  This device is a little on the complex side, being that you have to hit several selections just to choose one option.  BUT - for me?  For the price?  I like it.  It's cheap - and it's modern - and it shows the temerature of my apartment versus the temperature I want it to be.  Living alone, I don't need much more.  I was hesistant to use this thermostat being that I'd never heard of \"Lux Products\" before - but I'm pleased with it.","is_deceptive":false}

It started with that loud blood curdling screech that only my friends could hear, following shortly after with a complete loss of voice communication on my end. Now, I understand that this happens with headsets... but that happens OVER TIME! I took the headset back to have them replaced. The second pair was much more polished (and by polished, I simply mean there were small details I noticed about this pair, that the older pair didn't have) and lasted longer... about 5 months longer. Until the same thing began to happen again (I started to see a trend), but this time, the whole left speaker went out. I was able to narrow it down to a connection issue with the left connector that hooked into the module. I decided that that was the last straw. I took them back again and upgraded to the AX-720s. I really hope that I am not just cursed when it comes to the 180s, but I really do find the 720s much better as far as performance goes. The 180s are a great headset. However, to me, you just can't really stop those small electrical malfunctions unless you're educated on fixing those problems. I hope this review was helpful. I would really like to know if anyone else was having problems with these headsets as well.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Premium television sets used to advertise their screen size, image sharpness, and sound quality.  Not any more.  When you buy the latest LG, Sony, or any other LCD, LED, or Plasma display, the speakers are always on the back and very tinny with little bass response.  In short, the television manufacturers do not expect you to actually use the speakers in the TV.  Many diehard audiophiles will decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on stereo receivers hooked up to surround sound speakers.  For those with lots of money, space, and the time to set it up, these home theaters can be great.  For the rest of us, we want quality sound from our televisions that is compact and easy to setup.  This is the place where the Sound Bar really shines.\r\nThere are many brands with some similarities - you typically get a long speaker to go under the TV itself, either on its own stand or mounted on the wall.  There is also a separate sub-woofer for deep noise response.\r\nThis Sony HTCT260 was an upgrade to my existing Sony HTCT100.  Despite similar names, they are quite different.  To start, the Sony HTCT100 was a total of 250W of sound - three 50W speakers in the bar and a 100W subwoofer.  The Sony HTCT260 is 300W - two 85W front speakers and a 130W subwoofer.  Whether the front is two or three speakers is immaterial - they are all inside a single bar.\r\nThe Sony HTCT100 had a subwoofer that plugged into the wall, and the audio from the source plugged into the subwoofer.  Then the Sound Bar plugged into the subwoofer with a proprietary cable.  That meant the subwoofer had to be near the sound bar.  However, it also meant that the subwoofer was a receiver in itself, with HDMI pass thru, analog input, and optical input.  HDMI pass-thru means you can plug your Blu-Ray player into the subwoofer, and then plug the subwoofer into the TV.  It had multiple HDMI inputs so the Sony HTCT100 could switch between sources.\r\nThe Sony HTCT260 does away with the HDMI select capability - in fact, it doesn't have HDMI input at all, and the inputs are on the sound bar, not the sub-woofer.  The sub-woofer is a remote wireless device, so it can be placed anywhere, a major bonus.  It is shorter than the HTCT100 subwoofer, despite being more watts, is easier to conceal.  The only inputs are on the bar itself, consisting of Analog, Coaxial, and Optical.  Why did they make this change?  Consider my use of the HTCT100.  When I bought a TV that had networking capability, it meant that half the time I was using my TV, it was for content from the TV itself.  Since my TV had lots of HDMI inputs, it meant every device could also plug into the TV.  I eventually stopped using the HDMI passthrough and just plugged the optical out from my TV into the HTCT100.\r\nSince I assume most people have similar televisions now, the removal of the HDMI inputs and the wireless subwoofer of the HTCT260 makes sense.\r\nIn terms of style, the sound bar is sharp looking, a little longer and wider than the HTCT100, and with a built-in display, it looks really good in my TV setup.  There are touch sensitive input select and volume buttons on the front, so you can adjust it even if you lose the remote control.\r\nMost important, how does it sound?  In a word, amazing.  I was dubious that the extra 50W would mean anything, but I found the sound far more immersive and expansive than with the HTCT100.  Previously on the HTCT100, I had actually hit the MAX and still thought the sound was too quiet for some sources, but now I can crank up the volume and actually get it too loud.  The bass is full and can be felt, but is not overpowering.  Simple \"sound field\" buttons on the remote allow you to adjust the effect for movies, games, or music.  With the subwoofer placed in the back of the room, I can achieve most of the surround sound effect without having to run wires and place tons of speakers.\r\nFinally, pairing the speaker with my iPhone via Bluetooth couldn't be simpler.  I hit \"Pairing\" on the remote, and about 30 seconds later I was blasting Tchaikovsky through the speakers from the iPhone.\r\nHighly recommended - I'm sure you could get better sound with a more expensive system, but bang for the buck, I am totally happy with this sound bar and highly recommend you get one to go with your new television set.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I grew up with classic chili - spicy, not too wet. A substance of its own. A stand-alone easy dinner treat.\r\nOne winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking \"really, how different can chili recipes be?\" I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch.\r\nI was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times.","is_deceptive":false}

It took a day or two to get used to but now I feel weird sitting in my office chair without it. It's comfortable, holds air great, and you can move around on it without feeling like you are on a seesaw. It's helped my posture as well. I haven't had to reinflate it at all, and I've been using it for a couple of months now. 3 others in my office purchased one and have the same positive feedback. They also don't look as wacky and cumbersome as the exercise ball chairs, and deliver the same results of good posture\/abs while sitting at your desk. I also bought one for my mother who had hip replacement surgery and she said it has really relieved pressure when she needs to sit at her computer for awhile.

The powder form of L-Arginine (and anything for that matter) is something I prefer over pills since the cost gets cut in half, literally and I notice taking the powder has a more immediate effect rather than waiting for the capsules to disintegrate. Either way, L-Arginine is a terrific solution for lowering the blood pressure and upping performance in the bedroom, and a little bit of tribulus doesn't hurt either ; )","is_deceptive":true}

My biggest fears were (1) that the tubes would collapse under the weight of the cover when it was rolled up and (2) the reel would be unstable and move around while rolling. However, neither problem has occurred (so far after one month). Only problem is that sometimes I need to pull the cover taut if I notice it starts to bunch up in the middle as I crank it up. Otherwise, it makes a world of difference covering\/uncovering as compared to dealing with a cover without a reel. It's smooth enough that my wife and children can work on their own.

It offers excellent protection & will save your iPad from what ever accident may occur - obviously within reason.\r\nIt's a great looking case - sleek & stylish with professional appearance (Matte Black rubberized plastic). The cover is magnetic like the Apple offering & folds nicely to be used as a stand. When folded the case is significantly more stable than the Moko equivalent.\r\nThis is hands down the best case for the iPad mini & really has no disadvantages unless you are committed to buying a leather case - having owned both; I think this case looks much better than a leather case & from a protection perspective this cannot be beaten.\r\nSpend the (little - this case is great value) money - Buy this case!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Farberware BBQ Instant Read Thermometer with Large Digital Face, by Farberware.\r\nWhen I received this thermometer from Amazon, I was a bit disappointed. It is 1 \u00bc\" wide and 5\" long. I already have one of these small ones that are more difficult to read as I get older. The write-up on this BBQ thermometer gave the impression that it was larger.  The product description said that it would be 10\" long. This is false advertising by Amazon, and one reason that I hate to buy things from a catalog. If it is broken or not as advertised, you have to go through the headache of returning it through the mail. At least if you buy something in an old style brick and mortar store, you can go there and return it more easily. In the same shipment, I also received from Amazon a broken Salter kitchen scale that was made of cheap plastic with chrome paint. The description of that item gave the impression that it was chrome covered metal, not plastic.  More false or misleading advertising by Amazon.  I give up. I will shop at a local kitchen store instead, where I can see what I am getting, and can evaluate the product in the store. Fortunately, I can still drive a car and I do not have to depend on catalogs.

{"text":"Whether evaluating presentation, performance, ease of operation, versatility, this  http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00SMBGGV6  is without a doubt one of the best you can get these days at this price level. It's a large sound bar plus subwoofer and satellite speakers set that support just about any type of 'wired' connection including HDMI  http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00NH126Q0  out with ARC and can also pair and play off Bluetooth supporting devices such as phones or tablets.\r\nJust to get it out of the way, I am going to start with the negatives, few as they are and will follow with a detailed description of what you are getting. So, here are the negatives:\r\n- Partially wired. The satellite speakers are in fact wired to the subwoofer, probably a small price to pay for true surround.\r\n- 5.1 surround, not 7.1 or 7.2. Yes, it's a sound bar, not a full surround speakers set.\r\n- Can't play off USB thumb drives or SD cards directly. You will need some Bluetooth device for that.\r\nAnd that's it, all the negatives I can think of so let me discuss the system overall.\r\nPRESENTATION AND PACKAGING\r\nAs I noted above, this is a massive set and Vizio did an excellent job to get everything in a neatly organized box with all components clearly labeled and easy to locate. This is what's in the box:\r\n\u2219 the 54\" bar\r\n\u2219 subwoofer\r\n\u2219 2 satellite speakers\r\n\u2219 remote control and batteries\r\n\u2219 cables: optical, stereo RCA 3.5 mm, coax, HDMI, 2 satellite speaker, 2 power cables  http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00NH126Q0\r\n\u2219 mounting hardware: 2 sound bar wall mount brackets, 2 sound bar wall mount lugs, 2 satellite speaker wall mount brackets, 2 satellite speaker wall mount lugs\r\n\u2219 wall mount template\r\n\u2219 4 Velcro cable ties\r\n\u2219 Quick Start Guide\r\nAll of the above are quality items and I experienced near zero frustration getting them out of the box. Even better, just in case you may wish to return your purchase, there is a nice diagram on the box that shows exactly where everything is so, for as long as you don't destroy the Styrofoam it should be easy to get everything back in.\r\nSETUP\r\nGetting everything to work was quick and easy.\r\nThe Manual is very well written and it covers and illustrates the speakers layout, mounting and how everything is connected. It explains clearly how to use the HDMI's ARC feature with your TV (make sure that the TV supports it if you are going to buy a new one) and how to wire several devices to the bar, taking advantage of its many ports.\r\nBy the way, you get: RCA Analog Audio In, Optical, 3.5mm Analog Audio In, Digital Coax Audio In, HDMI Out (ARC), HDMI In and USB. And, of course you can pair wirelessly via Bluetooth. The bar supports aptX, allowing real-time streaming of high quality stereo audio over Bluetooth.\r\nOPERATION\r\nThe set comes with a great, simple and effective remote control. It really comes down to selecting the proper input and then let it roar, so to speak. The manual explains how you can integrate the system into another 'universal' remote. I haven't tried that yet but it appears to be very much the standard remote 'learning' process.\r\nThe subwoofer has a wireless link to the main bar which was properly set in my case but, just in case, there is a pair button also. All wires are properly labelled and, as I noted already, the manual explains how you can have several devices connected. All was quickly done for my experimental setup involving a TV and a gaming console.\r\nWhen paired with a Bluetooth device, your phone or tablet or laptop have complete control over what is playing on the bar.\r\nPERFORMANCE\r\nGetting to the final question of 'how does it sound', the brief answer is 'it sounds grrreat'. Thanks to the satellite speakers, this is true 5.1 surround, not a simulationand it's done through some good quality hardware.\r\nTalking specs, this is what you get:\r\n\u2219 Sound pressure Level (system): 104 dB\r\n\u2219 Frequency response (system): 45 Hz - 20 KHz\r\n\u2219 2 3\" full range transducers (bar, one left and one right)\r\n\u2219 2 3x6\" bass radiators\r\n\u2219 3\" full range transducer (bar, center)\r\n\u2219 2 3\" full range transducers (one per each satellite)\r\nSUPPORT AND WARRANTY\r\nVizio promises lifetime support for the product to cover setup, connecting and technical problems. They also have a one-year limited warranty.\r\nRATING\r\nI have no choice but award Vizio's bar 5 stars because I love it. It's as close to ideal for anyone looking for a 'serious' bar to work with a large TV that delivers great surround and plays off mobile devices.

{"text":"Houses need to be maintained and one area that is often neglected is outside cleaning. Most of us keep our grass cut and the shrubs trimmed, but we often overlook the outside of the house itself. This is where a power washer can help and a good tool for the task is the AR Blue Clean AR390SS Cold Water Electric Pressure Washer.\r\nI have used power washers in the past but I never had one to call my own until now. This one is better than the power washers I have experienced previously and probably the main difference is the power. This power washer delivers a whopping 2000 psi of dirt- busting power, easily enough to eliminate the grime and other buildup on the sides of your house or your driveway. I was actually a little worried about the level of power and wondered if it would be too much. This made me hesitate a little at first, but once I started to clean, my worries vanished, my confidence increased, and I continued to wash my siding at a fast pace. You can, of course, dial down the pressure a little, but the 2000 psi is fine for most uses and makes the task of cleaning the siding or driveway that much easier and faster.\r\nThis power washer comes with several attachments like a turbo nozzle, pencil nozzle, fan spray nozzle, and detergent nozzle. These different tips are an improvement compared to the power washers I have used in the past. They allow you to select the right tool for the task, for the best overall cleaning. I haven\u2019t used any detergent or cleaner yet and have used primarily the turbo nozzle since it delivers the strongest stream of water. But it\u2019s nice to know that the other options are available when I need them.\r\nI like the reel on this power washer and I like the ease of storage. The power cord is fine for my house because I have outside electrical outlets on each side of my house. If your home has fewer, you may need an extension cord. Other than that, I can\u2019t find many bad things at all to say about this powerwasher. It gets the job done and exceeds expectations on most all levels, making it an excellent choice for outdoor cleaning needs.","is_deceptive":false}

They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos.

{"text":"I heard a lot of buzz about this game before it came out but was hesitant since; well EA has not had the best track record as of late. But I was wrong; this game is bascially all the fun things from every FPS of the last 20 years rolled into one. The guy who made it is responsible for the first Call of Duty Modern Warfare (and not the later ones that were just churned out to make a quick buck). I am honestly playing this as much as I did COD MW back in the day. I love it on the XBOX One as I prefer multiplayer games like this on the console but should be just as good on the other platforms.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"For the price, this kit is a real winner. That said though, the CFLs included in this kit are epic failures. I read some reviews about the bulbs failing or catching on fire, but assumed that would be unlikely. While I didn't have any \"fiery\" experiences, I encountered a close-second when the large 105wt CFL began smoking - yes, literally - and then flickered out moments later. At that time I was more than a bit concerned and went to check the other 105wt bulb and found that the base was incredibly hot (especially for a CFL) and that it too smelled like an electrical fire. I decided to opt for safety and take that bulb out as well. I should also add that the bulbs had only been on for about 30 minutes - which brought their grand lifespan to about 2.5 hours.\r\nOK, enough about junky bulbs from China. The rest of the kit: The stands aren't particularly heavy duty, but definitely up to the task for what I need them for - and I think as long as they're treated relative care, you (and I) will get lots of life out of them. I just used them for a video project and the lighting was great. I didn't need to use the backdrops, but found the other stands as a great help for various gear and other clamp lights I use.\r\nThe backdrops themselves are a bit sheer, but still decent quality considering the overall price of the kit. If you look at them as a \"free bonus\" in the kit, you won't be disappointed - but they won't compare with the better, pricier muslin you can buy. The only concern you'd need to address is lighting behind the backdrops popping through. If you can keep that in check, they will work great.\r\nI know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed with the bag - it's a great size, and decent quality. Everything fits right back in the bag without hours of careful planning. Tear the gear down and then stick it in the bag. Zip. Tada! So many bags are the exact size of the equipment, so unless you have a degree in space planning or zippered-duffle-bag management, you're bound to spend a fair bit of time stuffing it all back in there. Not so with this bag - plenty of space for the kit, and I was even able to toss a bag of quick clamps in there and some additional bulbs... yeah, remember those bulbs I mentioned above? Glad I thought to bring backups.\r\nSo the final verdict? It's a great deal. The bulbs may burn your house or studio down, but if you keep a fire extinguisher handy (or just don't use them at all), you'll be quite pleased to enjoy the nice, even lighting and decent backdrop kit.","is_deceptive":false}

I liked the fact that it has the air purifier AND humidifier built in, I was excited to use it to help lower my gas heating bill. It seemed to have pretty good reviews and I hoped it would work the same for me. But it did not.\r\nIt did not appear to be defective, it turned on and after a \"heat-up\" period it started blowing at \"full power\". I placed it in a 12x14 room (8 foot ceiling) where my main furnace thermostat is located. The temperature on the furnace thermostat was set at 64 degrees. I wanted to see how much the room temp could be raised with this new heater so the furnace would not kick on. I left the heater running for FIVE HOURS non-stop. The room temperature would not rise over the 64 degrees and the furnace still kicked on even with the heater running. Maybe this one is just a dud, who knows. I have an old small Lasko ceramic heater that outputs more heat than this thing...\r\nI have asked for a refund but because I bought from a third party seller (something I usually NEVER do) it will probably be a big hassle if they even agree to a refund and will probably end up costing me more to ship back than the item is worth :(","is_deceptive":true}

Purina Pro Plan has always been an excellent choice for a dry dog food. Ingredients include a high-quality protein (including chicken as the first ingredient), EPA (an Omega-3 Fatty Acid), Glucosamine (to help support joint health and mobility), Vitamin A, and Linoleic Acid (an Omega-6 Fatty Acid, for healthy skin and coat). The glucosamine is particularly helpful for older dogs.","is_deceptive":false}

Either that or get something like a http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00EEBS9O0  Cons: *There is a lot of flex in the screen directly in front of the keyboard. Very scary to grab anywhere on near the screen with any force. *The touchpad can be frustrating. It can't be used with games at all. Right click is near impossible sometimes. This is probably the worst thing about the computer to be honest. I am getting used to it, but really there isn't a way around this thing if you use it in your lap like I do. * No touchscreen. It would be better with one, but it's not really necessary. *Windows 8. This is probably just personal preference because it's totally usable, but I don't use the windows 8 homescreen in the least. I stay on desktop and that's it. *When I received the laptop, the top part of the screen was separated but clicked right together. No big deal. *I have noticed some scaling issues. Google Chrome does not scale whatsoever with the 1080p screen, so everything is very small on the screen. This is easily fixed by using Firefox, which scales perfectly. I'm not really tech-savvy enough to know why it does this (without googling...). Haven't had many more scaling issues other than with chrome. *All of the ports are on the right side. Someone may have an issue with this, but I don't. *The charger is a little difficult to plug in.  Pros: *Awesome display! 1080p is really beautiful on the matte screen. Works well in the sunlight as well as indoors and in the dark. *KILLER keyboard. I came from an older toshiba satellite, and I thought it had a good keyboard. http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00SXX975K Nope, this is what good is. The keys are perfectly spaced, backlit in red, no spacebar issues like I had read on other reviews. The keyboard is probably one of my favorite aspects about this computer. *Graphics card is good. I can't playSkyrim at ultra high quality with no lag whatsoever but it's good. *Huge amount of space in the hard drive. I really don't know how I'll ever use near that much. *The case is beautiful. *Huge touchpad *3 USB ports *The speakers are really great. I could actually sit and watch a movie on this, or play any game clearly in a crowded room if needed. *Wi-Fi works, I have had no issues at all connecting or having slow speeds. *Super thin and lightweight *Earlier Windows software can be easily used on Windows 8 if needed.

This was on an extremely low dose of only 200MG a day. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have bought a supplement like this, but the evidence is hard to ignore.\r\nNaturabest's bottle recommends a dose of 800mg, which is considered the appropriate amount for this supplement.\r\nI personally started taking this supplement 3 weeks ago, taking ONE dose per day, on my way home from work, before dinner. I really started noticing a reduction in appetite after about one week taking the supplement religiously, so it may take that much time or longer for you. Since I started taking green coffee bean extract, I have lost 6.5Lbs total.\r\nI have toyed with the idea of taking two doses per day, but I'm in no huge rush to lose weight (I have been overweight my entire life), and don't want to overdo it. I AM losing weight, and I WILL keep it off, and this supplement is helping me accomplish that in an easier way than I would have ever thought possible before. This brand seems on par in price with other brands, I picked this one because it was the first one that showed up when I searched on amazon and it wasn't dishonestly priced (sometimes I worry about products that seem a little too cheap).\r\nI will continue buying this product until I have reached my goal weight (22.5 more pounds to go), and then I will take this as-needed once I am there.","is_deceptive":true}

I saw a whole bunch of recipes that literally made my mouth water.

The taste is just out of this world!\r\nThis seasoning has so many good flavors packed into it.

I have recently joined the Lucky Brand denim fad because through Amazon the jeans are much more affordable than at the Lucky brand store. $99 at the Lucky Brand store and their own website  is pretty high to pay for jeans especially in today's economy.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My brother had one and I was so impressed I bought one just like his. My other brother bought the older version and it too works great.  Why is it great?  It allows one to access a seemingly infinite amount of different content, e.g. movies both new and old, tv shows -- many of which were broadcast 20 - 40 years ago, listen to all genres of music, not to mention sports from all over the world --- at no cost!!! Plus you can access pictures, videos and documents from your network.\r\nUnfortunately the setup instructions are lacking.  My brother set mine up for me at his residence which had very slow internet access (750 kbps)  -- and yet it worked fantastically! Then when I got home the setup he had done would not work at first -- it was set up using a wifi connection but I'm using ethernet cable.  By trial and error I have managed to get the settings adjusted so that it works, but it takes patience.  Once it is setup it's not too difficult to operate.  Tonight I was able to use it to watch the Bengals - Colts football game live as the game was not sold out and it was being shown later in the evening. I would give the system 5 stars but because of the problems I've had and the lack of instructions I'm giving it a 4.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This laptop desk isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. Here's why:  1. It was fairly simple to put together. I did it on my own in about half an hour. The instructions were easy enough and the parts were few. There is one step were an actual screw driver is required.  2. It is functional. I can adjust the height to whatever I need. I prefer to sit in the living room at my couch while I work but sometimes I do slide into bed with my laptop too. No problem. The top tilt works nice, though the little pieces to prevent sliding on either end are a bit uncomfortable for typing. I will have to elevate my laptop to make it more comfortable.  3. Product components are a bit on the cheap side. The tops are particle board. The pieces to prevent sliding, mentioned above, are just kind of pushed into the tops themselves. While I haven't lost one, I worry will pop out as they aren't really mounted with anything. Having them screwed in would have been a better design I think.  4. Nice little side table. I had hoped to use this for my wireless mouse, but I just don't think that will work while using this table in the tilted down position. It puts the side table a bit too high to accommodate it comfortably.  5. The wheels are there, but you may not know it. They don't glide very well on carpet or hardwood. I have both in my home.  6. It isn't reversible. It isn't a big deal for my own use, but it could be a big problem for those who move around a lot with it.  I wasn't overly impressed and I think there are some obvious design improvements to be had, but it works. It is a big step up from what I had, which was nothing. Quality and expectation would have been better established if it was more appropriately priced at under $30 in my opinion.  If this holds up for a couple years I will be shocked.  * Initial review. I will update on durability as appropriate.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So first I should probably explain why I got it and what I expected from it.  I just built a small Media PC to run Plex on for streaming my local videos to a TV.  I just needed something that would allow me control plex, be small enough to fit on an arm rest, and be easy for non techs to understand and use as others in my house would need to use it.\r\nIt has met those needs and more.  I use the D-pad arrangement to quickly scroll around in Plex.  Enter key starts, space will pause, S key for subtitles.  Wonderful.  The times something goes wrong and I need to quickly Ctrl-alt-delte, there is a function key for that.  The backlight is a nice feature and very useful for dark rooms, although I wish it would stay on a little longer than it does.  The touch pad is a great feature that I use to quickly get around the screen if I need to perform updates or relaunch Plex.\r\nI'm about 12 feet away from my TV and the computer this is plugged into and have very little issue using it like I do.  Now I will say that the few times where I am trying to type something, I will have to hit a key more than once being at this distance.  Also, when I hold it and cover the entire left side, that seems to interfere with the transmitter but not to any degree that I am bothered by it.\r\nFor a low cost way to control my MediaPC boxes, this is absolutely what I was wanting.  I've purchased another and am looking to get a third for my next Media PC box.  If I was looking to do any amount of data entry from 12' away I would have to find a different device.  But as this does what I wanted for a very affordable price I'm happy to give it 5 stars.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I transport a lot of electronic equipment for my work, often cross-country. Courtesy of careless baggage handlers and drivers, I have watched my precious equipment thrown to ground from baggage holds, tossed into trunks and simply dropped \u2013 once into a pool of Philadelphia slush. No harm came to my equipment, though I can\u2019t say the same of my heart which stopped beating during these incidents. I have come to appreciate hard cases.\r\n Xsories is a new entry into a market dominated by Pelican. Pelican is a premium brand and you pay for its stature. But you get an excellent case.\r\n Xsories offers three cases, all of which are worthy competitors to Pelican and have lower prices for equivalent sizes.\r\n The XSories Big Black Box 2.0 Shockproof Waterproof Storage Case feels as sturdy as a Pelican case. Made of \u201c ultra high-impact ABS plastic\u201d, it doesn\u2019t flex much when pressed. At some point, I will figure out a kind of torture test like dropping it with an unused camera inside on to a concrete floor. But visually and to the touch, the case feels strong. The latches are positive and there is a hasp for a lock. The case may also be fitted with a strap which is a definite advantage over any of my Pelican cases. There is also a grip handle.\r\n The inside of the Big Black Box is not particularly commodious, measuring about 10 x 7 x 3 inside.\r\n The interior is fitted with a foam insert that has been pre-cut into small cubes. You just pluck out the cubes to create a space shaped to fit your components. This means putting some effort into designing your inside to get maximum utility from the space. There is a foam layer on the bottom of the case and inside the lid. Your equipment inside is going to be well protected from shock.\r\n This is an all-climate case with an operating range of -40f through +176f. The case is described as \u201cwater-proof\u201d, though I am not sure just what the limits of that claim are. I do know t7hat heavy rain and winter slush will probably not penetrate. There is also an air pressure compensation valve, though I have never knowingly used this feature on a case.\r\n Overall, Xsories has created a very worthy and less expensive competitor to Pelican and other \u201cpremium\u201d brands, though you might want to consider the next step up in their line, the \u201cHuge Black Box\u201d which offers more interior space. It all depends on your needs. The \u201cBig Black Box\u201d weighs less than 2 pounds, the \u201cHuge Black Box\u201d weighs slightly over 4 pounds, which is also a considceration.\r\n I like this case. So far I think it compares very well to the more expensive Pelican.\r\nJerry","is_deceptive":false}

A user posted a picture of the infant swing which this does not include.  The 3 piece set includes the support bar, a plastic play bar, and a strap seat.  I see the description says this clearly, just beware the pictures are not accurate for what you get.\r\nOverall the set is very quality and hope my daughter will enjoy once I purchase the infant swing for this set.","is_deceptive":false}

I unlike other reviewers did not use it at night as I was not comfortable with that.

{"text":"I relieved it a few days ago. have only really played with it, frivolous excuses to use it. I did a rudimentary calibration test. It seems to have come dead level, as it should, but sometimes they don't.\r\nthe laser shell is a very intelligent design. The top spins freely and smoothly with the down point at the center. So you can put the dawn point on your mark, then spin the body till its square or parallel etc. Then the micro adjuster picks up and works smoothy.Very fast easy laser to set up. I would struggle for sometimes 20-30 min with my old box Laser to set it perfect. This one is right away, first try.\r\nCons, the 3\u00b0 (5\u00b0?) self leveling range is very small. it really wants that bubble night on the middle. you really have to adjust the little tripod legs every time. Pro, the legs adjust well, smoothly and fast. Easy to get good at. the beeping when your trying to set it up is somewhat loud and angry.\r\nCon 2, the gap at the bottom, between the down point and the beginning of the line is bigger then I hoped. 2-3 ft. Can screw you up in some situations.\r\n3, tripod legs are spread to wide to fit on a 2\u00d74 plate, cant use it as a point laserto plumb up studs.\r\n4. How long will it last? dont know yet. But at $120.-. Who cares? you can buy the 700$ PLS Version, and it go bad in a year. And by the way, the Chinese generic came first. the PLS ripped off of this.

{"text":"After reading about this keyboard in the reviews, I decided to take a chance.  I have carpel tunnel in both hands and the old flat keyboard just wasn't cutting it.  This keyboard is a dream, and with the slant is very comfortable to use.  No use repeating what the positive reviewers have said, as I agree, however I do have one major complaint.  There was nothing in the box that had instructions on how to program\/use the keyboard, nothing, not even an address to go to.  I managed to find the instructions buried in Microsoft's site, but that was a very frustrating experience, and might try a novice's patience.  For such an excellent keyboard Microsoft has let us down for not providing any type of documentation in the box.  I didn't feel that knocking a star off the review was needed as this is an excellent keyboard, especially if you spend hours working on it, or if you have carpel tunnel.\r\nWhat I found on the MS site was: MouseKeyboardCenter_64bit_ENG_2.2.173.exe.  You could probably change the 64bit to 32bit if needed.  This program will let you assign tasks to the special function keys as well as explaining other functions.  From what I could find, this was it, although references were made about drivers, none of which I could find.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I've used Sony headphones for a long time. They have a tendency to rip near the jack, but for the price and sound quality I just replace them each time that happens (every 8 months or so). When I got an iPhone I tried on the apple earbuds and discarded them immediately. So painful. I came straight to amazon and bought these.\r\nThey fit in my ears as well as ever. They come with different sizes so it's easy to find one for you. My only complaint so far is that the microphone feels too high up on the wire, and that it's a bit flimsy feeling. The flip side of that is that I appreciate that it's very light weight and doesn't feel like I have a weight dangling from my left ear. I'm sure I'll get used to its high position.\r\nOn a side note the in-ear portion is interchangeable with all other Sony earbuds and most of the style in general. I put some blue ones on and I really like the red, white and blue effect. 'Murica.","is_deceptive":false}

And I find it amazing, as it was my first time controlling a copter than can do a 360 trick.\r\nAbout the battery, so the lifetime is your average one where the charging time is longer than the playing time, but even so, I really liked this quadcopter so I decided to bought another 3 sets of battery so I can play it longer. Also when it comes to price, it was really cheap than your typical RCs and it was also ready to fly from the box where I find annoying in other brands where it took me few minutes or hours to set up the RC.","is_deceptive":true}

Alot of the time I have it hooked up to my computer becouse it gives me realy quick controll of the volume going to my speakers or headphones. It Gives me 4 outputes, all with there own volume controls. Its case is made of metal so its pritty rugged. The sound is graet, I never even have to max out the volume on it. I never seem to lose any sound quality. It uses 1\/4\" stereo jacks, wich is no problem for me cus I always use my vintage headphones. I ordered converters for other headphones and audio equipment I sometimes use. I would prob advise using some velcro if you are going to have it in one spot all the time cus it slides easly.

The one hiccup was author Quatro's nod to a husband of 24 years. So, wrong about the youth. I'll start again, this collection feels like the work of a beginner.\r\nThere is a focus here on sex and death that bespeaks adolescence. It recalled to mind , not for stylistic reasons, but because the focus of these stories is relentlessly those of a teen. Disease, arousal, death, smatterings of religiosity, more arousal, more death, more disease. Then too, there is the clear influence of an MFA program interlaced throughout. All of the stories feel too studied, too intentional, to be deeply interesting.\r\nWith practice, Jamie Quatro could easily become a fine writer, after she breaks free from the university and the colonial artiness that presently entrap her muse.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So, I got these to take on vacation, so I could listen to my music without disturbing others and I love them. When turned on, they have a blue light that blinks every few seconds, but I asked and that did not bother those around me, and I can't see it unless I'm in front of a mirror or in a dark room. I'm no audiophile, but the bass sounds solid to me and the mids and highs are crisp enough for me. I have not had to charge them since the initial charge, and that was two weeks ago. I listen for 1-3 hours a day. The controls are not as intuitive as I'd like, simply because they are exactly the same on each side, so if I forget which side the volume is on I can accidentally skip forward or back a track by using the those controls on the other side. They are very comfortable, and I wear glasses, even, but after about 3 hours I'm ready to take them off. I've taken calls on them and the person on the other end says it sounds fine, but it sounds a little funny to me because my voice is muffled and I'm always afraid I'm talking really loudly. I'm really happy with them.","is_deceptive":false}

The thing that is most important to me is that it is fairly thin (.407\").

{"text":"I want to first clarify some points others have been making in the reviews on this TV. It IS indeed 120hz, the person who left that review obviously had no idea what they were talking about. I've seen people dock it stars for the lack of smart functionality. This is not a smart TV. It has a basic,navigable, and responsive menu. I have also seen docked stars for lack of ports. The site plainly lists how many ports the TV has, it's your own fault if you expected it to have more.\r\nI have something plugged into every port on this TV, except the USB port (I have no need).\r\nXbox 360 plugged into the Component inputs (old style 360), WD Media Player into 1 HDMI, and a future HDMI cable already run for my future Xbox One. I also have standard coax cable hooked up to this TV as well. This is all I need the TV for, which is why I went with this one vs a TV with more options since budget was an issue.\r\nI haven't yet tweaked with the picture settings yet, but plan to and I hope to update this review when I do.\r\nPros:\r\n-Beautiful display. My friends have commented on it's sharpness, color, and thin bezel. Minimal glare, if any in my setup.\r\n-Absolutely perfect response time. I am a very heavy gamer, and this works great for FPS and fast response games. If you plan on using this for any game console, this is your TV.\r\n-Absolutely no 'soap opera' effect.\r\n-Color and Blacks have been very impressive. My previous LCD LG (i think 09 model) would go to 'lit black' on dark scenes, kind of like an extremely dark grey. I would say this TV is as close to real color and contrast as you can get.\r\n-Nice sized remote, not a wii type.\r\n-This TV does have a physical power button on the bottom, that is kind of like a joystick you can navigate a mini menu. Cool feature.\r\n-Optical out, which I also use with a Soundbar\/Wireless sub-woofer.\r\n-True 16:9. Fits fully on the screen, no black bars.\r\nCons:\r\n-Wall mount issues.After having issues with this  http:\/\/fave.co\/1bADEyN  popular Cheetah mount on Amazon. I ended up getting this one  http:\/\/fave.co\/1bADIyz  and it went very well. The ports on this TV are basically right in the middle of the back in the TV, right where the brackets for a wall mount go across. The Xbox 360. Coax, and HDMI fit, but BARELY. They are pressed hard into their slots from the bracket of the wall mount, and take hard right angles. Terrible design for the ports, I wish they were the waterfall type.\r\n-I expected the built in speakers to be a little better, but I'm being pretty picky here. I only listened for about 10 mins before I hooked up my quality Soundbar just to test.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"There have been many attempts to create educational \"games\" over the years. During the early days of home computing, most kids saw right through this (though I admit to quite enjoying Where in the World is Carmen San Diego before realizing it was teaching me stuff). Beyond those early days, I have very little exposure to learning games, but like many parents, I feel better with my child running \"educational\" software rather than midless space shooters. With that in mind, here are my impressions of this LeapFrog title...\r\nLast year, I got my then-3 year old son a LeapPad 2, and earlier this year I got to upgrade him to a LeapPad 3 so we could review it for Amazon. Since then, he has accumulated a small variety of cartridges for it, and he spends time on his \"green iPad.\" He still prefers to watch YouTube toy review videos on his mom's real iPad, though.\r\nFor his 4th birthday, he received a new Thomas the Tank Engine playset and this Rainforest cartridge. He was thrilled at the new Thomas set, but I managed to get him to spend a bit of time with the LeapPad. The game spends some time with cute animations an narrations explaining what it is about. He was not in the mindset to focus on all the talking and was trying to skip through them. Once the actual game began, it appeared to be a platform-style game. My son has not become video game obsessed yet (he still prefers real world play), so I helped him a bit with basic controls. The character walked through the rainforest until it touches an animal. Then, icons come up and dialog plays describing attributes of different types of animals. It then asks the player to choose what type of animal they just found. It followed up with a similar thing about types of feed (webbed, bird claws, etc.) and asks about that. At least in the first stage, it appeared to be a simple \"I'll tell you something, then ask you a question\" quiz program, disguised as a platform game.\r\nIthought it was neat (though as a child, I would have found it a very un-fun video game, but certainly a more entertaining educational title). My son, however, soon went back to moving toy trains around his new multi-level playset. I expect he will revisit this title in coming months\/years (it has a good age range), but it is clear that right now, video games won't pull him away from the Island of Sodor.\r\nI don't find anything particular bad about this title, and it seems an entertaining way to learn about animals and such. I suppose if you child is more in to rainforest stuff than trains, they would find this far more interesting.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is based on an advanced preview of the book\r\nI have worked in a limited capacity with Javascript and jQuery in the past - and found this book useful for filling in the holes in my understanding of how Javascript in particular actually worked. There were lots of points through the book where I found things out that I probably should have known but had never quite understood.\r\nI also liked the way the software engineering focus to writing code in a style suitable for large applications.\r\nThe overview of the client side data storage APIs is the area I probably learned the most (I had really only heard of these before - never used them) and will definitely use these in the future.\r\nI also learned a lot I didn't know about the new Javascript APIs around files and web workers.\r\nThe web application developed through the book is relatively simplistic - it would have been nicer if it was slightly more complex - but probably it was sufficient for demonstrating the subjects of the book.\r\nOverall I would recommend for intermediate and senior programmers - but anyone new to Javascript may want to buy a beginners book first.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I was skeptical when I purchased this Chalkseries Chalkboard contact paper because I have already bought my fair share of disappointing generic chalkboard contact papers- the thin flimsy ones that don't hold chalk nearly as well as they are supposed to. However, I decided to take a chance with this one although it is more pricey than the generic  Con-Tact brand.\r\nAs almost always with FBA, the items arrived within 3 days. The retail box looks amazing-  the company definitely put some great thought into it.\r\nI cut an 18 inches x 2 feet portion and applied this on my bedroom wall. I instantly realized that this chalkboard contact paper is different from the rest- it has a much thicker material (which later on I will find to be the main reason why this product is superior). I was able to apply it perfectly without leaving any air bubbles trapped underneath.\r\nAfter using this for 2 days, there are a few things I can comment on in detail.\r\n1. It holds chalk EXTREMELY well and when you erase with a dry cloth, almost all the chalk marks are removed. NONE of the chalkboard contact papers I have previously used comes close to the quality of this product.\r\n2. No \"scratch\" marks are left behind even when you do write hard.\r\n3. If you want to \"reset\" the chalkboard, wipe it with a damp cloth, and your chalkboard will look absolutely brand new. Not a single smudge will be left behind.\r\nIn conclusion, I admit that it's obvious that I have nothing but praises for this product. I would give this product a 9.5 out of 10, only because I wish it was as cheap as the generic contact papers out there! But I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. When all is said and done, this product is DEFINITELY worth buying if you are fed up with chalkboard contact papers that are mediocre!","is_deceptive":true}

The mouse is really lightweight and kind of plastic-y.  I didn't need the mouse.

What they forgot in designing this carseat, however, is comfort (both for the Mom and the Baby).  My baby HATES sitting in this carseat.  It's super-narrow and deep.  Maybe the depth is what makes it so safe but I wonder if it's worth it to have your baby be uncomfortable each and every time you take a car ride. In terms of discomfort for the Mom: this car seat is heavy and bulky.  I hurt my back hauling it with a three week old so I would suggest really thinking about how much you might be moving the car seat around (I live in NYC and I take the car seat out to use in its frame as a stroller--or I used to until I decided to get rid of this monster).\r\nI got this car seat off of my registry and was really thankful for it but this thing is a beast!\r\nMy husband and I recently purchased a comparatively cheap Graco carseat to use at his parents' home and my baby LOVES it.

{"text":"In anticipation of the new film version of \"Into the Woods\" I decided to take a look at this Tony winning stage production which used the original cast.  It was actually filmed for a television episode of American Playhouse that aired on March 15, 1991.  It is available on DVD and Blu ray.\r\nThe story by James Lapine, who also directs, blends together various fairy tale characters (Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack and others) into one story.  The nexus is the Baker (Chip Zien) and his Wife (Joanna Gleason) and their inability to conceive a child.  The local Witch (Bernadette Peters) agrees to reverse the Wife's \"condition\" but the couple must bring her 4 items.  A red Cloak, a gold shoe, a white cow and \"yellow as corn\" hair are her demands.  Somehow these items together would release the curse of the Witch's grotesque features.\r\nWorking with one basic stage, the production is pretty rudimentary but is buoyed by the music of the great Stephen Sondheim.  Peters is of course a terrific singer and gets many of the big number including the tearful \"Children Will Listen.\"  I was also taken with Ms. Gleason's humorous take the Baker's wife.  She also has a fine singing voice.  I'm most familiar with her as a supporting actor in numerous films.\r\nThe rest of the actors are very good and have seasoned singing voices.  The costumes were pretty original.  I was a bit surprised to see the Wolf's (Robert Westenberg) costume to be anatomically correct below the belt.  This must be a little concerning for some, especially in the first scene where he confronts Little Red Riding Hood (Danielle Ferland).\r\nThe DVD is problematic.  The video is washed out and not very pretty to look at.  The editing and direction are pretty good however.  Audio is only available in stereo but it is fine.  The music is great, the story is interesting and the acting is top notch.  I highly recommend going for the Blu ray.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Very disappointing. The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.  The author has talent and I enjoyed his descriptive writing style, just not the story.  I had to force myself to finish and I didn't like the ending.","is_deceptive":true}

The issue I found was in the 90 degree fitting where the water tube attached. I removed the fitting and used a drill bit to make the opening going through the fitting larger.

All of which were self reviewed and so thought to buy this book after seeing Table of Content in it.

{"text":"Initially we bought the 19\" Conoco .  That lamp, because of its design, (and the design of our Yamaha C3 music bench) would not illuminate the entire sheet of music from top to bottom unless the shade was adjusted (rotated) out...and then the LEDs shined directly into our eyes.  Instead of simply returning the lamp, we called Conoco customer service and found out what a great company this is.  After explaining the issue to the tech, he immediately suggested two other solutions for us: a 14\" lamp with a gooseneck arm between the lamp and clamp, and this 22\" lamp, where the radius of the attachment arms is about twice that of the 19\" lamp.  We chose this one and can only say \"wow!\"\r\nNot only is the lamp more suitable because of the attachment arm radius, it also has a height adjustment which we've set to accommodate some of the larger page-size, antique sheet music pieces we use.  The light quality and quantity is superb and because of the design of this model, it also illuminates the keyboard, without any light overflow into our eyes.  We absolutely, without reservation, recommend this lamp!\r\nOne final word about Conoco: not only was the customer service tech helpful in understanding and suggesting solutions to our issue with the first lamp, he went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied.  After making the decision to try this lamp, the first question he asked was \"how can WE do this?\" I suggested going back through Amazon.  His comment was that if we needed any additional help, to just call him.  Overall, a very satisfying customer experience.\r\n***Update 12\/2013***\r\nWe just bought a second one of these for our son's family.  Each time they visit, they admire this lamp, so we bought one for them as a gift.  We still love it and use it every day.","is_deceptive":false}

Inevitably he can pick out which reeds play the best immediately. Then we label these reeds by marking the back of the reed with a sharpee 1, 2, 3 or 4 stars. We would do this over time with all 10 reeds until all the reeds are categorized. What we have also learned is that over time, some reeds take a bit of \"breaking in\" period, so it may have to be upgraded from a 2* to 3* or 4*, and other previously highly rated reed may be downgraded over time.\r\nPick up some of these and you'll be happy! http:\/\/amzn.to\/1GNce4U","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This is a handy, well designed portable luggage scale.  It has a nice finish of chrome with a window that shows the weight of the luggage hanging below.  The window that shows the weight is offset so that you can hold the handle with luggage below and still read the weight.  The strap is a good length so that you can hold the luggage at a relatively normal height while weighing it.\r\nThe unit measures in g, Kg and pounds so it can be used internationally.  It is also useful for weighing any small or medium weight object that you may need to weigh if you can attach the object to the scale.  This is a good value and I recommend the luggage scale.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster.\r\nI won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this \"biographical\" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.\r\nThe story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.\r\nIn the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans. It has an interesting, if wildly fictional, story and is well-acted. It's a great movie for a lazy afternoon.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a great family game to play, as long as you don't have any sore losers in your family or gaming group. This game is half offense and half defense. As long as everyone is just out for themselves, this game is a lot of fun. If one person is ganged up on or if \"teams\" are formed, things can get a little ugly.\r\nThe premise of the game is already described pretty well in the publisher's product description, so I won't go into that any further. What I will say is that the game can be taught to play in about two minutes, and anyone aged 5 or older will be able to play it without any trouble. This game has a fun theme and is very light in terms of concepts and rules, making it an easy entry-level game for anyone who isn't accustomed to \"designer\" games. Play time for the game is around 30 minutes if four people are playing, but shorter is fewer are playing. If you want to expand the game's number of players to five or six, there is an expansion available () that must be purchased separately. This game was out of print for quite a long time but is finally available, again, along with a few mini-expansions, including  and . I have no idea how long this print run will be available, so it may be a good idea to purchase this while you can get it!\r\nSurvive is a fun little game that most any kids or adults will enjoy playing, and they will probably want to play it more than once - especially if the scores are close! I highly recommend this to all families!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is the best picture quality of any TV I have had. It is a 4K TV and even though there isn't any 4K content yet without getting movie on a hard drive and paying out the nose. This Samsung upscales the content up and it looks pretty darn great. Noticeably sharper then others that I looked at. The sound is also very good. There are plenty of smart features and internet hookup without having any external devices like Roku, Apple TV. Upconverts any source inputted. Samsungs latest backlighting technology.\r\nI bought the TV for the picture quality not really for the 3D. Most of the smart features are just extra pluses.\r\nIt does a decent job of upscaling the HD content, but remember it is trying to upscale from HD to near 4K and the information is just not there for it to do real 4K. It, for the lack of better terms, makes a guess on what 4K should be. That withstanding it does guess well, and will offer a better picture than standard HD, just not UHD so expect that. Samsung isn't talking about what the specs are for the up scaling at the time of this review.\r\nPros:\r\n1. Excellent color and sharpness. Also controls to can easily adjust the picture to any way you wish (moe color saturation, less saturation, sharpness, brightness, etc) Lots of smart features I am still learning.\r\n2. Excellent sound upgrade from standard HD Samsungs. For the price it should have good sound huh.\r\n3. Watching Lord Of The Rings On This Will Make You Cry\r\n4. 3D works great and comes with four sets of glasses.\r\nCons:\r\n1. Dialog box pops up telling you that you can use voice controls. This is very distracting and I don't need the a dialog box on the TV to pop up to tell me this. Its in the instructions booklet. It doesn't happen very often- but it is annoying. You can disable this but it takes some time to dig through the screens until you are there.\r\n2. Heavier than standard HD versions of Samsungs, like the 8000.Good info for those mounting on wall.\r\n3. No Content to justify early adopter purchase price.\r\n4. Friends watching Lord Of The Rings (Also crying picture is so good) begain plotting to take \"Precious\" from us.\r\nThere is just nothing to watch right now and the prices of these 4K sets are going to drop at least another 500 just like when the HD sets came on the scene. Plus the 4k technology will most likely get better when they decide just how the content is going to be implemented. On the upside Samsung uses what they call a Hub or One Connect box so if content inputs get better you can just replace the hub box instead of kicking yourself that you have to get a new set.\r\nI tried the Netflix 4K streaming and it's a mixed bag at this stage. Some of the nature documentaries look like 4K and some look more like 1080P.\r\nThe UHD dvd players are coming so if you have this Samsung you will be ready from day one. I think even the xbox is going to offer 4k content when connected. Does have a superior picture than non UHD tv's. Its just gonna cost ya a little more brother. I had to have it. I couldnt wait. My current tv died on me and I had to do something. The only thing I could rationalize, being addicted to great new technology, was to go into debt to feed my habit. I am so ashamed at my weakness.\r\nIn all seriousness:\r\nMy suggestion is if you must have the latest 4k tech then here it is. Much better than Sony especially with their no customer service. The LG's do look good, just not this good.\r\nUPDATE 4-25-2014\r\nOk there has been a big controversy on whether this model comes with a one connect box or not. You get a different story everywhere. Found a Samsung training representative who spent two hours educating me on every 4k tv on earth and what was what. One Connect; 2013 version of this model had the external One Connect box. 2014 version of this model has internal One Connect with no external box. When One Connect technology is updated you can get the external box and it overrides the internal to keep everything cutting edge. He said samsung is supporting One Connect for a guaranteed four years to guard against your tv becoming obsolete. I asked him about the 1080p to 4k upscaling. He said yes it does a good job at kicking up standard HD better than Sony or LG, but if you want to see something great, get a 4K bluray player, then he drug me around to show what it could do. It was very impressive. He shared a story about the 9000 which requires an external One Connect box to opperate as all the technology is in the box and the tv is basically a monitor, said stores all over the place are misplacing the boxes when they move a tv and have all these dead big screens everywhere.This TV is a keeper.\r\nSPECIFICATIONS:\r\nGlossy screen, black bezel and cabinet, silver T-Shape stand\r\nThe Tuner receives over-the-air HDTV broadcasts (Seperate HDTV antenna required)\r\nQAM cable TV tuner\r\nRVU-compatible (for DIRECTV) -- DIRECTV subscribers with the Genie Whole-Home HD DVR can watch live broadcast and stored content on this TV without an additional receiver\r\nUltra High Definition TV with 4K screen resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels)\r\nHEVC for compatibility with streamed 4K content from sources like Netflix\u00ae\r\nTV Displays 3D images when you wear Samsung's active 3D glasses (4 pairs of glasses are included)\r\n2D-to-3D conversion adds 3D-like depth to non-3D video sources\r\nLED edge backlight with Precision Black hardware-based local dimming and UHD Dimming software-based dimming for superb contrast and black levels\r\nClear Motion Rate 1200 blur reduction 240Hz refresh rate plus backlight scanning\r\nUHD video upscaling seamlessly upconverts SD and HD content\r\nInternet-ready Smart TV\r\nSupports up to 5.1-channel audio with streaming movie services like Netflix and Vudu(tm) (audio quality depends on your connection speed)\r\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi to link to a wireless network\r\nQuad-core processor for seamless web browsing and app multitasking\r\nQuad Screen splits the TV screen into four quadrants so you can watch live TV, video clips, and the web all at once\r\nAllShare video and music streaming from a DLNA-compatible Windows PC\r\nMHL-compatible HDMI input for viewing photos\/videos from a compatible smartphone on the TV's screen\r\n2-way screen mirroring -- send content wirelessly from device-to-TV or TV-to-device with compatible smartphones and tablets\r\nBuilt-in stereo speakers (10 watts x 2 plus 20 watts for woofers)\r\nComes with two remotes: a touchpad remote with built-in microphone for voice control, plus a standard illuminated button-based IR remote","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased this on a whim because I needed to add a ten dollar plus item to qualify for super saver shipping on an order. I was always curious about these dongles, and the product started earning five stars before it even arrived. Shortly after placing my order the manufacturer sent me an email with a link to the latest drivers and software. That alone is an unusually high level of service.\r\nWhen this adapter arrived today, I had it up and running - and connected to a bluetooth speaker - in less than ten minutes. Step one was to install the drivers on the accompanying CD ROM (I could have downloaded them had I been diskless), then the software itself. The wizard stepped me though discovering the devices to which I wanted to connect and I was done. A great feature is when you connect to a speaker it appears as a headset and you have the option of hands-free operation or not.\r\nAs an experiment I decided to check if my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 would connect. It did. Unlike when the adapter streams music to a speaker, I could move files from my phone to my laptop via bluetooth.\r\nFor the record I installed this on an ancient ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP, SP3. No problems and no issues. The laptop immediately recognized it as a new piece of hardware as soon as I plugged it in.\r\nOne final feature I love is I have this plugged into a port that is closely adjacent to a second USB port and there was sufficient clearance with both ports occupied.","is_deceptive":false}

The sound is amazing though and the different sound settings are easy to use. They are very durable and the stand that is included on the receiver is very useful. As far as setting it up with consoles, I didn't have any problems and only connected the optical cable and USB for power so that was pretty easy. I did use them connected to my iPhone which was awesome because if I wasn't using the mic I would just listen to my music while I was playing and you can still hear the game too.

{"text":"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this book.\r\nI knew that the POV would switch to Danaus before I even started Pray for Dawn, and therefore, I was a bit hesitant from the start. I usually don't like changes in POV, and often times authors are accused of using this strategy as a cheap \"cop-out\" method when they don't know how to convey feelings of secondary characters.\r\nWell, there's no \"cop-out\" here, and book 4 delivers a much-needed break from the formulaic repetitiveness of the first three installments. I was afraid that Mira and Danaus would yet again fly to a far-away destination to prevent the Naturi from wreaking havoc. However, that was not the case here.\r\nIn Pray for Dawn, Danaus is finally confronted with the being that holds part of his soul. Through various efforts, the bori tries to manipulate Danaus and Mira to set him free, so he can permanently roam the earth.\r\nA few of the characters we know make an appearance, but most of the air-time is dedicated to Mira and Danaus.\r\nUnfortunately, there were also some inconsistencies, but they can be overlooked.\r\nFor one, Danaus has several strange encounters with Mira where she acts totally out of character.\r\nFor example, she calls her car her \"baby\" and she makes several passes at Danaus when you least expect it.\r\nAlso, some of the plot threads are repeated and some of the interior monologue gets re-hashed to bits.\r\nDespite its flaws, Pray for Dawn offers a nice change from the non-stop fighting action of the first three books.\r\nMira and Danaus spent a lot of time together getting to know each other better as she brings him deeper into the world of Nightwalkers.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm very impressed with these. I have been looking at various collapsible poles now for about 18 months, and always figured I'd pony up and buy a set of Black Diamonds. A few months back, I started knocking out 14ers in Colorado this year, with the goal to get 10 in about 6 weeks. I have used about 4 others sets of trekking poles in my hiking life and was never particularly sold on any of them. Obviously when a hike become a difficult class 2 or class 3 scramble, fixed poles become a PITA, and I usually end up strapping them to my chest or bag. I also like to be able to adjust my poles (shorter up mountain, longer down) since I have a bad knee. This set was the first \"hybrid\" (adjustable, collapsible) pole I stumbled across on Amazon, and I figured for the price it would probably be cheaply made or heavy. Surprisingly they were slightly lighter (an ounce each) than my other 3 sets, and the ergonomics of the handle surprised me as well. I have put about 40 miles and 4 peaks on them so far including Colorado's highest peak, and the second highest in the continental US, and I was impressed enough to come back to order another pair.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is my first experience with a Toshiba product. The instruction manual is fair and fairly confusing until you learn that it is written in a catch all fashion. The unit is easy to set up, nearly plug-n-play. The remote is light with good-sized buttons (well labeled). When transferring a film from your tape library to disc, be prepared for a fuzzy outcome. The picture will appear as though in slightly diffused light. This is because the VCR unit isn't top quality. Not enough reading heads. But the audio will knock your socks off! It's a very small hitch in your get along, though. You do not have to try to re-purchase that rather large library you built up over twenty plus years. With a little effort, just a few hours, you'll get the hang of how to transfer images, create titles and menus, and how to finalize your discs so that they can be played on any other DVD player. Great price. Good machine.","is_deceptive":false}

But if you are counting on the full capacity as advertised, know that it is really more like 4k or so (roughly). Still pretty good given the compact size in my opinion.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"After looking at the competition http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00L6TMHW8 and http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00KDJ4YXM  1. I love love love that the monitor is able to turn and I can basically see the whole room easily. I just need to swipe my finger on my phone screen. I don't need to adjust the monitor angle manually and then check where the viewfinder is, I can do it from anywhere in one second.  2. I still can't get over the fact that the audio in this device is two way! Not only I can hear my baby laugh and cry but I can also respond back and know that she can hear it well. Sometimes I can see her kind of starting to wake up and I talk to her softly and she goes back to sleep \u2013 without me needing to go to her room.  3. My husband does a lot of business travel and unfortunately misses a lot on the baby's milestones. With this monitor he can easily check on our babygirl when he is away. He says the quality of video is great even when he is so far.  4. The voice recording is just great! I can see a lot of potential for it when the baby gets older \u2013 I can record some bedtime stories and leave her listening to them and fall asleep by herself. Right now we use it to play lullabies of my husband singing. I play them for our daughter when he travels for work.  My husband and I opted for this baby monitor. We LOVE the new baby monitor! It has no delay in video. I haven't tried peep mode because I like too be able to see her at all times. It holds charge very well and for the people saying it doesn't I have found for it to get and keep fill charge it had too charge while it's off if it's running and your charging it it didn't take full charge.  People complaining about the light being bright are crazy cause its not bright at all and only blinks when there is noise in the room.  I can see her clearly in day our night vision!!

{"text":"I bought this along with a similar model, the HTL7180, for the same $99 price. I wanted to compare. The CSS sounds much better. The sound is smoother. The bass is fuller. The dialogue is clearer. The remote seems better. And overall, the CSS is a big improvement over the older HTL, which is still for sale, but apparently discontinued. I returned that one to Walmart.\r\nI have the CSS hooked up to a new model 32 inch Vizio smart TV with built-in apps. It's a master bedroom application. I think I will keep this unit since it performs well enough. It sounds better on music actually, than as a movie soundbar. Its simulated surround sounds sounds better than the HTL also. That one sounded like too much reverb. I wouldn't turn this unit up much past 30% unless your ears are oblivious to distortion.\r\nThe remote has adjustments for bass and treble, but they are minimal. This improves on the sounds of the TV speakers, obviously. A bonus is that its not too tall so it doesn't interfere with the TV infrared remote.\r\nI have a feeling  the whole TV soundbar craze is going to disappear soon as TV makers figure out ways to make tvs sound better without all this extra junk cluttering up rooms. Soundbars will probably go the way of VHS players and Sony Walkmen in due time. But until then, this $99 unit serves the purpose adequately.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a cheaper alternative to the \"String Swing\" wall mount-- considerably less expensive.  It's easy to mount, easy to adjust and holds the instrument well.  However there are serious problems.    When I first purchased these I gave them a 5* review because they seemed to work very well.    However... over time the material they're made of can eat into guitar neck lacquer. In addition, the arms simply don't stay in place, tending to droop down and \"trap\" the guitar when one tries to remove it from the hanger... forcing you to use one hand to hold the guitar and the other to pry the hanger arms apart.    Further, the guitar neck may be stuck on the hanger prongs, damaging both the hanger and the guitar finish.    After several months, I cannot recommend these. The more expensive wood-mounted versions are far better. Or save some bucks, mount a piece of wood to the wall and screw in a coated U-hook to make a fine guitar hanger.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As a teacher, I am always looking for a great YA book- something that will not only entertain my students but get and keep them reading! Haven by Kristi Cook was just what I was looking for.\r\nAfter her father is killed, Violet McKenna is presented with the choice of living with her stepmother Patsy in New York, or going to Atlanta with her Grandmother. Afraid that the frail woman could not take on a teenager, Violet finds herself in New York, at the prestigious boarding school- Winterhaven. This move will provide her the opportunity to start fresh, avoid the looks she got at her old school and come into her own. The truth is Violet has always been different. She has told friends and family that she suffered debilitating seizures but that was not the truth. These episodes were a gift she did not want: psychic visions. When Violet is overcome with these visions she is also filled with dread, for they often tell of a violent or dangerous event that will befall someone close to her.\r\nThe school Winterhaven is beautiful and elite, only accepting those they find are in true need of their services. Violet is not yet aware that the services the school provides are for those with psychic abilities. Her friendships there are composed of honesty and acceptance, and she finds that Winterhaven has also provided her with something more. It is through her ever growing feelings for the mysterious Aiden, that she discovers the truth about herself and this new fantastical world.\r\nHaven did contain some elements of Twilight, and though the similarities are there, it rose above the expected and accepted plot line of mortal and immortal. Violet is no normal girl. She contains abilities that she did not want, but by the end of the novel has come to accept and hope to perfect. To me, Haven leans more towards Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Sarah Michelle Gellar version), and empowers young female readers to embrace their differences and be who they are.\r\nParanormal books set in boarding schools always catch my attention and this one did not fail. I would have loved to have gone to a school like Winterhaven (with or without the paranormal). You could watch the friendships unfold between Violet and her roommates and how she befriends the other students at her school. Violet and her friends are just like any other teenager except for their telekinesis, visions and empath abilities. They talk about boys, worry about sports and exams and miss home. The characters are incredibly real. Furthermore, it was impressive how some of the secondary characters were revealed at just the right moment.\r\nThe pacing, though a bit slow in the beginning, was great for immersing yourself into the story and giving you the time to get to know Violet and her friends and follow Aiden on his personal journey. Just when you think you have a handle on what is going on, Kristi Cook throws something at you that you did not expect! This was a great read and something I will definitely recommend to my friends and students. I cannot wait to read more from Kristi Cook.","is_deceptive":false}

My Shepard looked slightly older and tired (which would makes sense from a story perspective) in some scenes and then look fairly young in others so consistency wasn't there. That isn't a make or breaks though just an observation.\r\nGameplay wise I thought the combat felt a bit loser, but that's mainly because Shepard has more freedom of control in his\/her movements, it didn't feel as cumbersome as ME1 but strangely felt a bit more lose than ME2. They definitely made the game even more TPS (3rd person shooter) than the previous two titles, but I overall enjoyed that aspect.\r\nThey cut down on the character roster, but I originally thought that was due to the quality vs. quantity approach. While I'd say there were some pretty memorable dialog and interaction, the amount vs. the previous two titles is lower. Day 1 DLC controversy didn't affect me to much since I purchased the collector's edition but I can understand why people are upset about this because Jarvik really had some interesting insight into the lore and he definitely contributed more to the actual storyline vs. say the DLC characters in ME2 so to make him a DLC, I just don't agree with that.\r\nVoice acting I thought was great as always, so no real surprises here.\r\nThe story is where all the trouble really is for everyone.  I really don't want to get into any more details about this because it has been talked to death already. For me the ending was like Bioware sucker punched me in the stomach and then took my wallet, laughed and then walked off. It really left me with a feeling of disgust as to how someone at Bioware thought this was the appropriate way to finish the Mass Effect series. Leaving lose ends in the 2nd part of a trilogy or 1st part is understandable but a finale is supposed to tie those all up, not create brand new plot holes that are so huge you could fly the entire Sword fleet through it! The ending basically negates everything you were doing in ME1 and ME2.  I originally planned on replaying the whole game over again to do different decisions and see how those decisions would affect the final outcome. I no longer feel this; I just want to forget about the whole game. It is because of this that I feel this game deserves this rating.\r\nIt really does sadden me that this is how Bioware decided to conclude Shepard's story.  And before anyone says it's the journey not the final destination, I think the survivors of the Titanic might have something to say to that. While it is true the journey can have a very strong impression on a person, the ending can make or break things.  In this case, the ending did break it. If Bioware's ultimate goal was to get \"speculation from everyone\" and get an ending no one would forget, mission accomplished but to bad was for all the wrong reasons.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Despite my parents (or is that to spite them), I love pumpkin \u2013 pumpkin pie, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin muffins\u2026.  And thanks to my discovery this year, I can add Hershey's Kisses - Pumpkin Spice to the list.\r\nThe orange and brown striped wrapper looks just like a normal kiss, and the shape is the same as well.  You\u2019d certainly never know that these are something different \u2013 until you unwrap them.  Inside the foil, you\u2019ll find an orange covered kiss.  If you bite into it, you\u2019ll discover a small white chocolate core, but most of the candy is made up of the orangey outside layer.\r\nAnd that\u2019s a good thing.  These kisses don\u2019t take much like chocolate but then again white chocolate rarely does.  Instead, they taste just like perfectly spiced pumpkin, and the white chocolate adds a touch of sweetness while letting the pumpkin spice flavor take center stage.  I can pop one in my mouth and taste the delicious cookies or muffins I\u2019ve had in the past.  They melt in your mouth fairly easily, although I find it hard to wait long enough for them to melt.  I\u2019m chewing and swallowing while unwrapping the next one.\r\nWhich isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing since these kisses aren\u2019t good for you.  9 of these guys have 210 calories, 110 of them from fat.  And there are no nutrients to speak of at all.  What did you expect from candy?\r\nThis is hardly surprisingly when you take a look at the ingredients.  We've got your sugar, vegetable oil, milk, corn syrup solids, and whey, with less than 2% of a ton of other things that aren't healthy for you either.\r\nHersey\u2019s makes these in the early fall to coincide with Halloween.  That just might be a good thing.  It gives me something to look forward to and it keeps me from eating too many all year round.\r\nSo, if you like pumpkin, give the Pumpkin Spice Hershey's Kisses a try.  I bet you are unwrapping the second before you\u2019ve completely eaten the first.","is_deceptive":false}

I believe it to be crucially important for students (young & old) to begin music making doing just that - playing as much as possible first without being encumbered too much by reading lots of notation. The CD recording is very good in that it starts students playing using a G tuning thereby allowing music making to be virtually immediate. However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1\/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)! Odd, especially considering that the G tuning IS at correct pitch. Publisher needs to correct this ASAP!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it. Kids today seem only interested in themselves and what's going on in the present, never caring what happened before they were born. The saddest part of this is the fact that in being this way they never expose themselves to some of the greatest things in the world, everything from classic novels to pieces of art that have survived centuries. With any luck a few of them will watch THE MONUMENTS MEN and consider doing so.\r\nGeorge Clooney stars as Frank Stokes, a military officer in World War II who presents a case to President Roosevelt about the famous works found in museums in Europe. In this presentation he shows Roosevelt famous pieces of art that have gone missing, supposedly taken by Hitler to be put on display when he wins the war in a specially built structure. That is if he doesn't damage them first or if the allies don't damage them while fighting battles from one town to the next. Stokes request is that a special select group of men work to save these pieces of art before they are all destroyed. Given the go ahead, he assembles his team.\r\nThe team is small. There aren't that many people qualified or willing to be a part. Each has their own role to play in helping with this seemingly impossible task. Included in the group are James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). These are the Monuments men, the elite group that sets out to fulfill the task Stokes has set forth. Granger is sent undercover to find out as much information as he can concerning the whereabouts of artwork stolen in France. The rest are split into teams and sent searching for other various artifacts.\r\nUsing various methods they accumulate enough knowledge that they discover a patternused in the transport of these works of art. It appears that each location on the map they point out with the clues presented there are underground mines where the art has been stored, at least in part. As the troops move forward, the team accompanies them in an attempt to fulfill their mission. Placing their lives in danger, not all will come home, but each will play his part in this truly historic mission.\r\nThis gives you the basic idea of what the movie is about. What it doesn't do is show the admiration these men had for not just the task at hand but the items they were sent to save. While some might find a Rembrandt of a museum quality piece of artwork in a foreign church boring, these men look upon each with reverence and respect. The military might see their job as unworthy of their efforts but a twist results in them finding more than they bargained for.\r\nBased on the true story of this team the movie offers it all. There is plenty of camaraderie among the team, an affection that develops between them as they move forward. There is the awe that each one inspires with the items they find. There is humor in various moments where things can be light hearted. And there is tragedy as some fall to the enemy.\r\nWhat makes this movie important though is to consider what it was they actually accomplished. To think that some of these pieces might have disappeared (which some actually did) makes their story one of success where few thought it could happen. That they were able to rescue as much as they did is an amazing feat and one that should be lauded. I found it amazing that it took this long for their story to be told.\r\nThe movie offers not just great entertainment but a piece of history that all should be made aware of. It's a film that young people should see to realize that there was a world out there before they were born and that many things they take for granted could simply have not been there if not for the efforts ofpeople like this. Ipads, Ipods and Facebook are all great things but not near as great as what these people saved. It would be nice to know that at least a few people in the world appreciate the work that they did. Hopefully young people will find enough interest to watch this movie and feel a bit of that.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Of all of the hi-hat models Zildjian offers this ranks up there with the most versatile. The only two other multi-purpose pairs I like more are the  and the .\r\nStill, you cannot go wrong with these hats. They have a strange design based on an old pair of Istanbul K. Zildjian hats Steve Gadd used to own. The top is heavier and slightly smaller than the bottom (the top is 13-15\/16\" and the bottom exactly 14\"). This configuration gives the hats a surprisingly responsive feel, and I like the sound - especially with the top hat loose in the clutch.\r\nUnlike the ride cymbals in the K. Custom Session series, which sound great out front, but terrible behind the kit, these hats are great sounding to both the drummer and audience. And they can project if needed, or will give subtle notes if played softly. This quality makes a pair perfect for just about any music genre or playing style. They also pair nicely with other cymbals from not only Zildjian (both A and K series), but other brands too.\r\nMine get used quite often, which is high praise since I have six different pairs of hi-hats from which to choose.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"First off I have LOTS more experience with my cheaper: http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3BOHL  This thing is surprisingly bright. From a meter away, ISO 100, it gives a 2.8 split.  A rather peculiar thing is that to my eyes the 126 led light seems brighter. When doing a light check with my light meter, a nice sekonic digital one, it was reading half a stop brighter than the 160 light one. That's funny, more lights equal less power. I did a test right up on the light source and the f-stop at 100 iso was 16.3 for both of them. I assume for some reason the drop off is faster on the 160 unit. The 160 led unit does however have a greater spread, and considering the vignette this is an advantage because more area is flatly lit.  The reason I give this a rating 5 is because the color temp is off. It is too blue, slightly green. This is no surprise considering the price. It is also why one of the gels that comes with it is -green. But I feel that the gels that they give are too strong for cine work. The -green only needs to be a 1\/4 maybe 1\/2, not a full. Now skin tone is too red; a nice gesture at least. Another con of the unit is that it is obviously more bright in the center of the light and then there is an uneven vignette to the rest. This is not specific to this 160 unit, I also ordered a 126 led unit and have the same issue. You can easily fix this by reflecting the light or putting on some black foil, but built in barn doors would be a practical addition.  In short get the:  http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3BPLM  This might seem like a lot of complaints, but for the price this is expected and still worth purchasing  I hope this helps!","is_deceptive":true}

I compared them to other reeboks I own and it was obvious that the toe box area is more narrow in this style. Also, the description does state \"creating micro-instability with every step\" which is true - I point this out because if you have issues with knees or ankles this might not be the shoe for you  (although it worked for me). I wanted badly to keep the shoe because of the ankle support and the thick sole - but I just could not handle the small toe box. I love reeboks and will be shopping for others.

{"text":"Pros:\r\n-The best looking G-Shock and digital watch I could find, period. Worth spending $130 (what I paid in 10.2011) just for the look. Looks bad-ass, manly, and heavy duty. You are no doubt to attract glances from everyone around you. I got compliments from women and friends who usually criticize my style.\r\n-There is no unnecessary flash, so can wear at the gym or more formal occasions.\r\n-This is a man's watch and makes every other G-Shock look either hideous or as a cheap toy. If Batman wore a watch, this would be it.\r\n-The home screen is well utilized - every pixel has a purpose.\r\n-Very light and fits comfortably. Not too big - just perfect. However, it's not comfortable to sleep with it on, so I take it off at night.\r\n-Solar charging is a big plus. Battery lasts 9 months on full charge without any exposure to sunlight. No need to change or worry about the battery. Ever. It conserves light by shutting off the display at night, which turns back on the moment you pick it up in the morning.\r\n-Stopwatch, timer, and five alarms with one snooze are very useful. I especially use the snooze option to remind me to take my medication at the same time each day. I do, however, wish there was a vibrate option (like the newer GD350, which was released Feb 2013).\r\n-Can see (a pre-set) second timezone at the press of a button.\r\nCons:\r\n-No seconds adjustment in timer, only minutes. I need to set intervals for doing sets while working out, and I wish to be able to adjust the timer to the second (like 1min 30sec).\r\n-Stopwatch is very elementary, whereas it has a lot more potential given the three-line display. Unlike the G7700 (which utilizes its 3-line displays perfectly), it only shows elapsed\/split times (which even cheap digital watches do).\r\n-Alarm is too quiet, I wish there was a volume adjust setting. I often miss it at the gym when timing my sets, and I don't even bother relying on it to wake me up.\r\n-The light stays on too briefly, for about 1.5 sec. I wish I could adjust the duration of the backlight to set it to 2-3 seconds (the newer GD350 has 1, 3, and 5 second light options).\r\n-Atomic timekeeping hard to get in SF area (Notice, the G9200 does not have atomic timekeeping).\r\n-I never use the barometer (although the barometer display is cool to look at), thermometer, or altimeter (which is inaccurate, because its reading is based on the barometer). Thermometer is not reliable - off by up to 10 degrees Fa (have to take it off for at least 5 minutes to get accurate reading). Also, too much scrolling through the barometer, altimeter, and the altimeter-record functions (like 7 or 8 for full cycle).\r\n-No compass... in case of a zombie apocalypse, you know.\r\nOverall, the best-looking digital watch you can find. However, I can do without the barometer and altimeter (and maybe even the atomic timing). I'd like it to have the option for a vibrator alarm and to be able to adjust the timer to the second.","is_deceptive":true}

First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won't spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.  When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.    The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma's kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma's have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won't be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.    On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes andsure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.    Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.","is_deceptive":false}

Toddlers can play with it in the bathtub or pool.  The pleated sides and matte silicone make it easy to grip.\r\nThe bowl holds about 12 oz. to the bottom of rim.  It weighs 58 g ( 2 oz.).  The outside diameter is 5 1\/16 in. at the rim, tapering down to a 3 9\/16 in. base, and the height is 2 1\/8 in. The little tab adds 9\/16 in. to the diameter.  When collapsed, it is 9\/16 in. tall.\r\nNamsan provided a bowl for evaluation and review.","is_deceptive":false}

Freed up enough space for 2 more guns on the one side of the safe.\r\nI only gave it 4 stars because the material is a little light.

{"text":"The universal plug is a little silly since you will still need one to plug this in while outside the US, but for field work, I absolutely love it, especially the easy to see green\/white color contrast.  I have used it already on a handful occasions, saving me from having to play outlet ping pong with big AC  housing plugs and a USB wall wart.\r\nThe USB output has a 4.2A ceiling, meaning one or two USB ports in use will give approx. 2.1A, whereas 3 or 4 simultaneous used ports will give 1A each.  US plugs fit in there nice and secure with plenty of space for even the humongous AC plugs (that in itself is a major attraction).\r\nThis probably won't take any major abuse, such as knocking around a gnarly toolbox or nasty construction areas, yet for me more staid circumstances, giving me direct power for powering laptops\/ and USB devices, this is does what exactly I have been wanting. Don't need the multi-plug aspect, but it takes the two prong\/three prong US plugs with a secure fit.\r\nThe head snaps up, but it takes not only some tight wrapping, but a smidgen of tugging to get it to snap into the holder. Just another 1\/4\" would have been perfect without the minor struggle, yet I leave that as feedback to the manufacturer - because I am otherwise supremely happy with this new power source tool.\r\n- Complimentary product provided for evaluation","is_deceptive":false}

Better for the $10 I spent than Drug Store sunglasses of the same price, but again that isn't what they are advertised as, and while a pipe wrench work fine for smashing walnuts, if you bought it to work on plumbing it doesn't get 5 stars if it fails to serve its primary function.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have never been a big fan of custom diets.  I have tried many before and got tired of the same thing over and over again.  I had some friends that were part of the cult that is ViSalus and kept trying to sell me on the product.  I finally broke down and bought it on Amazon instead of through them because it was cheaper and I am not being bothered to reorder and such.  Now for the product review:\r\nI love these shakes.  I am moderately active to begin with.  I play baseball once a week, I like to go outside and do yard work and I also have a woodshop that involves carrying heavy pieces of machinery and lumber around.  However I was 6'0\" and 205 pounds and really needed to drop some weight.  I thought 10 or 20 pounds would be good and I'd be fine.  Well after losing 20 in just a little over 2 months, I am now almost down 30 in just over 3 months and very happy with the results.\r\nIt tells you to drink 2 shakes a day and a sensible meal but let's be honest, we humans love food.  I did the opposite of what everyone tells you, which is to get on the scale once a week or once a month.  I get on everyday.  Morning and night.  I really wanted to track my habits and how I lost each day.\r\nI found the best thing for me is a bowl of Quaker Oatmeal in the morning (brown sugar maple), a shake for lunch (look on pinterest and find shake recipes), and a sensible meal like a turkey sandwich or wrap or salad or something at night.  If I wanted a snack I will eat something like an apple with peanut butter or some Special K cracker chips or something healthy.  I was not extremely careful in calorie counting but I do go over my options and choose the best one.  Don't get me wrong, you will want food, food, and more food while on this diet.  Just as you will with any diet.\r\nThe shakes are not that great by themselves.  Tastes like a typical protein shake.  I mix it with almond milk and other ingredients and come up with a less than 200 calorieshake that tastes great.  My favorite for instance is 2 scoops of powder, one cup of almond milk, 1 tablespoon of PB2(look this stuff up, it's awesome), 1 tablespoon of chocolate Fat free Jello pudding mix, and one teaspoon of caramel flavoring.  Throw in a handful of ice cubes and blend and it tastes like a snickers.  As I said before, you can look on pinterest or other sites and find recipes for different shake flavors that are great and PB2 instead of peanut butter provides half the calories and fat.\r\nSo all in all, I would highly recommend this diet for someone that knows how to stick to a diet.  I lost 20 pounds in over 2 months with no time at the gym.  After that 20 it was a little harder to lose so I now work out about 3 times a week and I feel and look great.  I am still losing but I am also adding muscle so I don't notice the weight drop as much but it's still there.  All with just one shake a day instead of 2.","is_deceptive":false}

Few people, including two different furnace guys I've worked with, have the slightest idea that it takes 3 wires for a furnace to provide top functioning, but it does. However even if we'd hooked up the Source 1 with 3 wires it still required a huge amount of programming and was generally ridiculously arduous to set up.

{"text":"Overall I really like this choice especially at this price point. We mounted a 42\" flat panel LCD. The stand is sturdy, and the TV mount pivots very smoothly. The wood legs are real wood (as far as I can tell) and the trim backboard is strong. The finish on the computer looks like a dark oak or walnut. Make no mistakes this is cherry to black cherry finish. It's much darker than the photo. The plastic (metal-looking) trim pieces look a tad tacky, but this is a really low price point for such a sturdy stand. We had to order the middle shelf bracket again as this plasticy-metal trim was glued on 1\/4 inch too far left which made the plastic roll under and jut out at the leg. Whalen said the part was in stock and said we'd have it in 7 to 10 days. That was 6 days ago...we'll see. The metal is strong, but be careful not to over tighten the bolts too much as the metal will give. All the materials were clearly labeled and separated. The best I've seen in any case-goods product.. None of the parts were scratched or dented...one metal bracket was a little bend, but I reshaped it easily. The glass is blackened (painted?) on one side, but it looks just fine from the top. If you plan to put any electronic equipment, speakers, or game controller chargers, etc. on the top shelf the cord management is a bit out of the way. Great value!","is_deceptive":false}

(As others have stated, each color cube has differing time sequences. I chose white for the 30 and 45 minute increments.)\r\nIt is quiet. No annoying ticking. And the alarm is loud and not the kind you'll ignore. It definitely will stop you and make you turn the cube to reset. I also love the fact that you don't see any time showing. When I've set other timers, seeing the fact that there are 10 minutes left makes me rush whatever I'm doing to try to finish before the alarm rings. Not with this one. It's very Zen-like and helps you actually forget time but be mindful when it's time to stop. But yes, if you look closely, near the on\/off switch there is a small minute counter. I try not to look at it too often.\r\nThis would be a great timer for any kind of practice - from piano to homework. Highly recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

This is really a shame because my kids really love the fact that these toys can go in the water. They are apparently poorly made and\/or designed.  By the way, I also bought the \"Explorer\" model and it has not had any problems. But reading the reviews for that model leads me to think I may have just gotten extremely lucky with that one.  One positive: Amazon's return\/replacement process is very easy and responsive (I got to test it out thoroughly).","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I live in the middle of a big city and just cancelled my cable tv to save money. I have a Sony EX710 HDTV.\r\nTonight the Roku 3 I ordered arrived from Amazon, AND this antenna.  Within 45 minutes I had the Roku out of the box, attached, and my channels selected.  Then I unboxed The Leaf.\r\nI am glad I ordered this antenna because on the ROKU I can't watch the local evening news or PBS real time.  The only difficult part was getting my tv to search for the channels after I plugged in The Leaf.  I did some searching online and finally found that I could not just go to \"antenna\" using \"input\" - I had to go to Settings on the Sony tv menu, then Antenna, then let the tv search for channels.  Within 5 minutes it had found 78 digital channels!\r\nUntil a few weeks ago I thought I was YEARS away from \"cutting the cable\" but I got sick of having to call ATT Uverse every 6 months to renegotiate the price of my tv package.  The Roku and The Leaf together cost less than $150 and I'm happy to spend $9\/month on Hulu Plus so I can watch the few network tv shows that I enjoy.  This will save me at least $50 a month and ELIMINATES the aggravation of renegotiating with Uverse all the time when I watch very few of the shows I was paying for.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I grew up in Wisconsin living next to the Mississippi river. The road between my hometown and my college town ran right along the river, winding along, up and down hills with barely a few pieces of wood and metal to keep my speeding car from flying into the water if I happened to hit a nice icy patch of road. Back then, I carried a pair of scissors in my car in case I found myself needing to escape from a sinking car. I would trade in my scissors any day for the security that this knife brings.\r\nNot only does it come with an impressive and strong blade, which I will get to talking about in a few, but it also comes with a handy seatbelt cutter. Though I haven't had to use it on an actual seatbelt, I would imagine it would work wonders at freeing me. This blade is always out, but is set back into the knife at an angle, so it is completely safe, even small fingers can't get to it. At the top of the knife is a small piece that juts out and has a bit of a point at the top. This would make breaking a windshield or window as easy as pie if you find yourself stuck in a sinking car. Just the simple piece of metal could save your life by allowing you to swim away.\r\nNow, the blade. The blade is a good size. Small enough to carry with you if need be, but big enough to be intimidating. It is smooth at the top and serrated at the bottom. Overall it has a good weight to it and it durable, cutting through tree branches like nothing. I live in Chicago now, and I certainly feel safer with this in my purse at night. And, though it might sound silly from someone who purchased a knife, the best part of this purchase was that the knife came with a detachable flashlight! I didn't realize it came off until the other day when I was using it to look for something in my apartment.\r\nOverall, the BlizeTec Survival Knife is a purchase I am glad I made. It will come in handy on my next camping trip, my next trip back to WI, and the next time I need a tiny flashlight.Most importantly, it helps me feel safer knowing I have a bit more protection as well as the ability to survive if an accident occurs.","is_deceptive":false}

They did NOT raise much in the pan either.  It's wonderful that one bag makes TWO 8x8\" pans.  Fortunately, I only made one 8x8\" pan the first (& only) time I've made.  Next time I will try to figure out how much sugar to add for the half bag quantity of batter, & hope it tastes much better.  I tried sprinkling with powdered sugar to help sweeten it, but that just did NOT cut that bitter taste at all.  If anyone has experimented with this, please email me & let me know what you think!  Unfortunately, I ordered the 6 bag quantity from Amazon in order to get the best price.  Unwisely, I had never tried these before I purchased this large quantity (which I have never done before) but regrettably went by the many 5-star reviews.

{"text":"I was hoping to find healthy, easy recipes that would create a dish that would last our family a couple of days so I wouldn't spend so much time in the kitchen. I was very disappointed and returned the book for the following reasons...\r\n1. The recipes require so much prep! I don't have an hour in the morning to chop veggies, brown meats, etc. I want to just be able to throw stuff into a slow cooker and go.\r\n2. I'd say about 75% of the recipes contain spicy peppers. My husband can't tolerate spicy food, so most of the book was pointless for us.\r\n3. Most of these recipes also contain nightshades (tomatoes, eggplants, etc.) that, in a Paleo diet, are to be eaten in moderation due to their alkaloid content. Nightshades have been shown to increase inflammation.\r\n4.She sure talks about herself a lot. I was curious to learn more about where these recipes came from, but pretty much every page was about Arsy, how she's Armenian, and what Armenians like to eat. Having a few Armenian friends, I understand that this is part of the culture and they are very proud. I really just want to hear about the food, though.\r\nThree stars for the beautiful design.

{"text":"Yes, the French have them, too. Directed with great style, this film seems tres moderne, though its stage source dates\r\nfrom 1925. The adaptation is really quite faithful, too. Best of all, the English subtitles fall in with the general\r\ngoofiness of the plot and add to the fun--like when one character is likened to \"un flamand\" (the Flemish traditionally being the French stereotype for \"uncouth\")and the subtitles say he's from Carlisle, presumably a wild and wooly English town. Lambert Wilson is extra fun. He's bilingual, and puts on an extremely funny spoof of an American's French pronunciation.\r\nI imagine some viewers won't think this is a musical at all, because the\r\nnumbers sort of slither in without warning. But there's a lot of singing. For those who'd like a comparison, one might\r\nsay it's a bit like The Boy Friend with an erotic edge.","is_deceptive":false}

In that case, might I suggest taking a look at this item: \r\nThis one gives you some interesting black tea choices. Although I had heard about Earl Grey tea from watching Captain Picard in Star Trek: TNG, actually trying this was quite amazing.

{"text":"The 8100 Pro is just a printer.  That's all it does. But, it does it so well!  As a teacher, my wife does a lot of high volume printing.  Print speed and ink cartridge life are paramount. This printer delivers. While your average inkjet printer will deliver 7 pages per minute, this one shoots pages out at 20+ per minute.  Even at high resolution settings, it's still 3X as fast as any other injet we have. Two sided printing is slower as it takes a small break after printing the first side to allow the ink to dry before running the page through for side 2.\r\nPrint cartridges reportedly hold about 10ml color and 20ml black.  They last a very long time. They can also be refilled if you choose to do so. If you do use recycled or refilled cartridges, just push \"OK\" when the printer points out you're not using a genuine or refilled HP cartridge. I've found unplugging newer HP printers, while removing and refilling cartridges, eliminates those warnings all together. Probably depends what firmware is on board.\r\nSetup was easy and only took a few minutes to get the printer on our wireless network and available to all 5 computers in the house. No problems encountered with Vista 32 or 64 bit or Windows 7 OS. No problems printing pictures from Windows Photo Gallery. It's a good, fast printer.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"There are a number of models in Ernie Ball\u2019s pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing.  To be clear, I\u2019m talking about the MVP 6162 \u2013 the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There\u2019s no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn\u2019t specify, based on performance it\u2019s a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models \u2013 best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups.  I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn\u2019t using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will \u2013 I\u2019m not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise\/interference here - just practical 'off').  The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume \u2018floor\u2019 \u2013 meaning if you don\u2019t want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal\u2019s full-heel position.  Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you\u2019re at the level you want,  can be a real convenience (and your sound person\/recording engineer will thank you \u2013 even if it\u2019s yourself).  At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive:  it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you\u2019ve only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep \u2013 and you wished for either a \u2018tighter\u2019 or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options.  In case you\u2019re wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an \u2018anti-volume\u2019 pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum.  I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away).  Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle \u2013 especially if I\u2019m doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way.  The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer  that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn\u2019t is a side-to-side tone pot function \u2013 granted it\u2019s cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it\u2019s there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn\u2019t detect much loss with the MVP \u2013 although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation.  The MVP\u2019s 3\/16\u201d brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice \u2018tooth\u2019 to it that\u2019s comfortable to use wearing shoes or not.  The min\/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios.  I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it\u2019s hinged otherwise it would just scream \u2018lose me!\u2019. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn\u2019t come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels.  If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal\u2019s internal components under the foot control \u2013 too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out.  I can\u2019t comment on the tuner jack function (I\u2019m old school tuning fork and ears).  Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals.  And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated.  I\u2019ll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"After years of spending thousands of dollars on high end watches, and after having had cataract surgery that left me seeing without glasses, but now farsighted, I wanted a durable, everyday watch that had a large face that is easy to see.  This G-Shock certainly, so far, meets my criteria.  I noted how others who rate this watch are not satisfied with the illumination.  That has not been an issue for me.  Pressing the illumination button allows me to see the hands easily, which is all I need.  Others have commented about how difficult this watch is to program.  I disagree.  It's easier to program than my Suunto Military X-Lander, and it looks a lot better on my wrist.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I use this film on my pedicabs in Houston. When the headlights hit the Pedicab's reflective film it's does the job well by reflecting the light. When you unrolling the sheet from the roll it does have some wrinkles, I believe that is quite normal when it is rolled on a roll and then unrolled. It  can be corrected by pilling the plastic sheet from the role and then applying back onto the sheet and smoothing out the bubbles in the process. This reflective film usually is really expensive. The small hassle of having to reapply some parts of the wrinkled sheets is a small price to pay for the incredible price you pay for the reflective room. It looks good on my pedicabs in Houston.

My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications\/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main \"seconds\" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.\r\nOverall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch.

We bought it to use at our county fair for a digital photography class. 4 stars only because it doesn't hold the program after you turn it off and you have to reset it each time you turn it on.

I put various sized pictures on it and they all filled the screen correctly without shrinking or stretching so that part will work great for what we're doing. The pictures display great, very representative of what they looked like coming off the camera which is what we need for judging. I'm trying video on it next week.

{"text":"Call me a freak, but I absolutely love good, gory movies.  I just can\u2019t help myself.  The more splatter, the better.  Films like Peter Jackson\u2019s DEAD ALIVE or Eli Roth\u2019s CABIN FEVER are some of my favorite splat-fests.  So when I saw the summary for CHEMICAL PEEL, I knew it was a must-see.  Chemical spills are always a great way to initiate some good gory action.  And let me tell you:  this film does not disappoint!  Chocked full of intensity and plenty of splatter, this horror flick is one you must see!\r\nI am very impressed with how much I enjoyed this film.  It is good on so many levels.  Great acting, intriguing premise, and excellent special effects (i.e. gore).  You just can\u2019t ask for much more from a horror film.\r\nCHEMICAL PEEL starts off with a bang and it never lets up.  The tension is in the air from the get go, and it\u2019s thick enough to feel on your skin.  I love this aspect of the film, as it puts the viewer in the midst of things right off.\r\nThe acting is great, with a whole cast of unknowns (to me) giving top-notch performances.  I have to give particular note to Natalie Victoria, who portrays the main character, Rae.  Victoria does a stellar job as the role of the downtrodden heroine, and I hope to see more of her work in the future.  I also have to mention Arielle Brachfeld, who plays Rae\u2019s sister, Angela.  Brachfeld does such a great job with her role, it\u2019s almost scary.  She makes Angela into a Grade A bitch.  I can honestly say I have not wanted a character to die so badly in a long time.\r\nThe special effects in CHEMICAL PEEL win the blue ribbon here, though.  There are several very nice gore scenes, and they don\u2019t leave much to the imagination.  One of my favorites occurs when one of the girls decides to take a shower and wash off some of the muck in the air.  Little does she know that water is a trigger for the chemical reaction.  As a result, the girl melts (literally) in the tub.  This scene is very well done, and it will haunt my memory for a long time!\r\nCHEMICAL PEEL is a big win for me, and fans of horror as well as gore-hounds alike will enjoy this one.  Make sure you watch this on an empty stomach, though\u2026even if you\u2019re not very squeamish, some of these scenes will make you look away.  The film is available now, so give it a look.","is_deceptive":false}

I just got tired of spending $45-50 for ink and figured I'd finally break down and buy \"generic\" pack of two for $20. I read the reviews on this and a couple others a number of times, finally threw caution to the wind and bought these. Well, it doesn't come close to performing like the original. Install was fine, except for the error messages that plagued me for almost a week, that it wasn't installed right. I'm not dummy and having done this for years, I know there is only one way they go in all the way to the test page. It's not rocket science. The pages will only print yellow for color, and the black isn't dark, it's light when it prints. Finally, while I can print say, a recipe off a website (albiet with a light black result)?

{"text":"First, I bought this through digital purchase on the Blizzard website, but I think getting as much negative press out there to prevent more gamers from falling for this ponzi scheme is important.\r\nWarning: If you purchase this game, you are willingly becoming a human node to farm profit for Blizzard. The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: \"The World of Auctions\" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.\r\nOne month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?\r\nThen there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.\r\nSoon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.\r\nJust do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"This watch has a lot of nice features.  The date is displayed on a white background, smoothly tucked between the 4 and 5 o'clock hour markers.  The watch hacks when setting allowing you to precisely set the seconds.  The chronograph seconds hand smoothly sweeps at 5 ticks per second.  The lume is bright and easy to read in the dark.\r\nLight blue accents on the chrono second hand and on the chapter ring at 12, 3, 6, and 9 add a pleasant dash of color.  The lume applied to the hour markers also has a slight blue tinge.  The only criticism of the watch face is that the markers on the running seconds do not match precisely with each tick of the second hand.\r\nThe weakest part of the watch is the bracelet.  The bracelet makes a jangly sound when you move your wrist due to the hollow end links.  The clasp is of good quality and clicks securely closed.  The bracelet does not have half-links, but the clasp has two micro-adjust settings allowing you to fine tune the fit of the bracelet.  I replaced the bracelet with an after-market leather strap.\r\nOverall, I think this is a nice watch with a good set of features.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is actually a beautiful piece, especially if you have a guy who usually prefers a sports watch but sometimes needs a dress watch for dressier occasions. This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.\r\nBetter yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.\r\nI personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.\r\nThe face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.\r\nThat said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.\r\nBut for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I just retired my Keurig after two years of use.  I didn't want to buy another one, because the Keurig started malfunctioning just about a year after I bought it, I was tired of buying expensive K-cups, and I missed the treat of french press coffee made with fair trade, organic freshly ground beans.  So, I ordered this french press in green and some beans from my favorite purveyor, DeansBeans.com.  Overall, this is a good french press.  Don't expect your coffee to stay warm with any french press, as a warning.  They are made to brew the coffee, not keep it warm.  After brewing, press the coffee and then transfer to a carafe or thermos to keep warm.  My only gripe with this coffee press is that for me the press doesn't extend down far enough.  The press part stops at about the point where the green lines the bottom of the glass container.  I rarely make a full press worth of coffee, so I know I'm wasting coffee because the press won't go down far enough to separate it from the grounds.  Knowing that I mostly only brew about 8 ounces at a time, I probably should have just got a smaller press, but I wanted one that could handle more for when I have company.  I guess you can't have everything, but I really do wish that they would have made the metal pole on the filter just a bit longer so that you could still feasibly brew less coffee with less grounds and get all the coffee out of it.

{"text":"One man's journey to conquer the physical becomes his emotional deliverance. Francis Slakey begins his quest with a goal in mind - set a record, to be the first man to climb the highest mountain on every continent and to surf every ocean. The challenge he sets out in front of him seems simple at the time: 8 peaks, 4 shorelines, 12 experiences to check off his To Do List. He is driven by his indifference to the world to shrug it off in this independent series of adventures. The world, as it turns out, would have none of that.\r\nSlakey is brutally honest about his own agenda, and about how he failed others in following it. At first he failed others, that is. But as he slowly began to open himself up to the amazing experiences surrounding him at every turn, his agenda changed. He changed. He found that it was possible to evolve from someone serving himself to someone serving others. And he didn't do it with a mushy gushy love story, although love was present. He did it by finding that man within himself, the one that always existed. Just as he encourages us to do, simply by telling his story.\r\nInspirational and exciting, follow Francis Slakey as he scales mountains, crosses plains of ice, hunkers down during blizzards, and dodges bullets in an around-the-world adventure that is like none the average joe will ever have. Slakey shares with us his most amazing experiences and his darkest moments and through it all we discover a man we can all learn from. Read it for the adventure, sure, but take away from it the perspective.\r\nI received this book for free through the Goodreads First Reads program.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself\r\nFor some reason, music stores and concert programs file British composer Michael Nyman under \u201cClassical Music\u201d. I find this interesting because that\u2019s not really what Nyman\u2019s music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for \u201cThe Piano\u201d and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a \u201cclassical composer\u201d?\r\nNext is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his \u201cpieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nyman\u2019s work is fast and he \u201cborrows\u201d tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nyman\u2019s work.\r\nThis wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthaus\u2019s intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nyman\u2019s tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled \u201cMusicologist Scorse\u201d. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nyman\u2019s \u201chits\u201d (but not \u201cThe Piano\u201d and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus \u2013 for those not familiar with the composer \u2013 is a 52-minute film \u201cMichael Nyman \u2013 Composer in Progress\u201d from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but it\u2019s nice to have it here as a bonus.\r\nIf you are a Nyman fan like me, you\u2019ll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the \u201cportrait\u201d first and then the concert.\r\nThe BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.\r\nI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.\r\nSteve Ramm\r\n\u201cAnything Phonographic\u201d","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a pretty good value for the money (at $28) but does have a couple minor issues which reading this review will hopefully make less of a problem...  On the positive side, the camera sensitivity is quite good and provides a very viewable image in most every lighting condition - even those really tough high-contrast daytime situations with lots of bright and shady areas. The IR LEDs provide surprisingly good lighting range out to at least 20 feet and beyond in nice dark conditions. The IR mode is the \"IR Cut\" type which switches between color and B&W IR modes at a preset low-light threshold. This provides proper daytime color compared to the weird daytime colors of non-switching cameras which simply \"mix\" IR and visible light. The 3.6mm lens provides a wide recto-linear (non-fisheye) field of view which covers a lot of area. The image quality seems nice and crisp in daylight but a little grainy\/fuzzy in really low light as one would expect. The all metal housing is quite tough and can be mounted with the all wiring and screws secluded to help prevent tampering\/vandalism.\r\nOn the downside, this camera does NOT come with a 12v power supply, but the good news is that it has BNC video and RCA type power connectors which are pretty-much the standard nowadays.  The camera itself is in a metal \"ball\", which  is compression-mounted in the housing, and is VERY hard to move when the housing is tightened-down. The housing is composed of three metal parts which are threaded together at the base. The manual does not cover mounting or aiming the camera at all and so one just has to figure this out or read it in a review such as this.\r\nThe base can be dis-assembled by twisting the mounting base and threaded ring in opposite directions until it threads apart. The housing must be completely dis-assembled in order to mount the camera using the 4 screw holes in the base ring. Once you have it apart it will make sense. After the base is mounted, the wiring can be threaded through the mounting surface, and the camera and housing can be re-assembled. You can aim the camera just before tightening the housing the rest of the way.\r\nSome notes about the IR mode... The camera's internal relay makes an audible \"click\" when switching between day\/IR modes, and in some cases it will switch back and forth several times when it's right on the threshold. This is especially true when artificial lights are also present in the camera's view. A short jitter in the video is normal when the camera switches modes. Also, avoid placing the camera where any objects or surfaces are near the front of the camera, as the IR LED light tends to reflect back onto the lens, producing a light gray, ring-shaped fog over your night image which greatly reduces the night vision quality. If you must mount the camera in tight spaces with eves or other structures near the front of the camera, you can use flat black spray paint on those surfaces to reduce the IR backscatter and improve your night image quality.  Hope this helps!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am a long time fan of Sony NEX cameras, and I have owned and used many of the Sony brand E-mount lenses available for the NEX cameras, including the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f\/2.8 Wide-Angle, the SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS, and the SEL55210 55-210mm f\/4.5-6.3. All those lenses have produced great pictures, especially when using RAW output corrected for distortion and chromatic aberrations through software such as Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom. When using the JPG mode the more recent NEX cameras, such as the NEX-5N and NEX-7, will, if the firmware has been updated, make a lot of those same corrections internally and automatically apply the corrections to the saved JPG images.\r\nThe only draw back to the zoom lenses of course is that they are slow. Still, for low light level work, the use of a so-so slow lens with vibration stabilization will usually beat an optically  much better fast lens that does not support stabilization. So I was interested to try the Sony SEL50F18 50mm f\/1.8 for low light work. The extra lens speed allows for the use of a lower ISO, and the net gain in image qaulity is worth the cost to use of a fast lens.\r\nThe lens has been great for work in low light, and the focal length has been perfect for close-ups of architectural details and art objects. If a photographer shoots in RAW, and uses Adobe Camera RAW or Lightroom to correct for lens distortions via software lens profiles, and to correct for chromatic aberration, or if the photographer shoots in JPG and uses the NEX camera's internal software corrections, then the few weak points of the lens are effectively canceled out. I have been very happy with my Sony SEL50F18 50mm f\/1.8, and plan to use it often on my next project. RECOMMENDED.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Collecting: X-Men (2013) #18-22\r\nIn the previous adventure, , the all-female X-Men's adventure was rooted firmly on planet earth.  In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.\r\nThe Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.\r\nThese issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.\r\nIf you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.  The next adventure for this X-team can be found in","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"True Junk - the spreader mechanism corroded in three short years to the point of becoming non-functional. It had become completely frozen, despite light use.\r\nHistory: I purchased this spreader at a local Home Depot. I used it twice a year to spread fertilizer\/lime on a small lawn. I stored it (empty) in my garage between uses. Within three years (about six to eight uses) the metal drive shaft (that spins the propeller) had corroded so badly in its bearing that it could not be freed with oils, solvents, etc. Even an air racket would not free it!\r\nI thought I was buying a professional spreader that would last a lifetime but rather I had bought an expensive piece of junk.\r\nOne last failure: While the spreader was already junk, I put the spreader away in the garage - postponing throwing it out. Come spring cleanup this year - I pulled it out of the garage for trash pickup and noticed the plastic hopper have developed stress cracks and a hole. That is how poorly manufactured the plastic is. And these flaws appeared while the spreader was empty, in storage, in a well ventilated garage!\r\nI can honestly state this is the worse piece of equipment I've ever purchased in the last twenty years. If Agri-Fab were willing to ship me a new one of these, each and every year, for life -- I'd pay the asking price. Otherwise - I'd look elsewhere.\r\n(BTW: During its short lifetime; it worked extremely well)\r\nFree advice to Agri-Fab: Upgrade your drive\/propeller shaft to stainless steel and improve the grade of plastic you use in the hopper. Then, you'd have a true winner - everything else is well made. Also - as noted - when it worked - it spread perfectly and with ease. It is a shame these design flaws exist because when it worked, this spreader worked flawlessly.\r\nIf this review seems contradictory - it is. What you have is a near perfect spreader that suffers from a few cheap components that severely limited its lifespan.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I bought this for my Canon 7D and have had it for over 5 months. I wanted to protect my camera from nicks and scratches since I regularly bring my camera on my hikes -- and this skin does a good job of it.\r\nPros\r\n----\r\n- Protection\r\nThe skin is very thick, which will not only protect the camera from nicks and scratches but help dampen the impact from bumps. (The thick skin does make the already large 7D a little pudgy.)\r\n- Durable\r\nThe skin's held up very well to all the frequent handling I subject it. There are no rips, tears, or any form of degradation. The previous skin I got for my Canon XSi held up to years of heavy use. This one looks to be equally durable.\r\n- Accurate Cutouts\r\nThe cutouts (for the screen, mode dial, lens mount, battery compartment, etc.) line up perfectly. Unlike my previous skin, this one lets me change lenses easily because the skin doesn't obstruct the area where the lens meets the mount.\r\nCons\r\n----\r\n- Hard Screen Protector Slides Around\r\nI'm worried the hard screen protector does more harm than good since it slides around and could potentially scratch the LCD screen (even if the LCD had a regular \"soft\" screen protector on since the very edges of the LCD aren't covered). Forget the Hard Screen Protector; a regular screen protector (included) will do the job just fine.\r\n- Buttons Not Clearly Labeled\r\nThis problem seems specific to only the skins for certain camera models. On the 7D, the labels on the buttons are imprinted as part of the molding, but they are barely legible.\r\n---\r\nThe Bottom Line: The Delkin Snug-it Pro is a well-made and durable product that offers the camera very good protection. The only shortcoming (for the skin for the Canon 7D) is the labels for the buttons are not clearly labelled (not a problem for me personally because I already know my way around the camera).","is_deceptive":false}

Not just for the lil ladies but for the lil guys too! They all love to dress up in the fanciest clothing they can find. Got a tiara or extra jewels? why yes please! The more merrier! We love to play dress up and what better way than a tea party! Tea parties are wonderful you get to imagine, hang out with friends, and also learn your manners while enjoying fancy snacks and drinks.With these teacup cake molds you can have a party anytime! Not only do they look really cute they also work well! The silicone liner is not too soft and is just right for making cupcakes! I also liked how when you go to remove the liner it removes very easy. When making our muffins or cupcakes I like not having to use oil or butter. Even then with out the oil or butter the cupcakes didn't stick at all which was really nice to see there wasn't a mess to clean.

{"text":"I have purchased organic oil from another company for over 10 years and NEVER had a problem.  I just decided to try a new brand. WHAT A  MISTAKE!  The first time I opened the bottle it smelled bad.\r\nI contacted Dr Adorable through email repeatedly, to no satisfaction.  I was told that since it was past the 3 month return limit, there would be no refund or exchange. THEN they told me that it was recommended to keep the oil refridgerated!  I was NEVER TOLD THAT and had never needed to do it before.  I was told in EVERY email what a great quality product they provide. I was also told that it only has a shelf life of 1 year.\r\nI went back online to see what product information was provided and found this  statement:\r\n\u201cShelf life- 2 years recommended\r\nJojoba oil may become cloudy and solidify as the temperature drops. This is a normal process that occurs from the hardening of the fats and waxes, and it will become stable at or around room temperature. Because Jojoba is not an oil but rather a wax, its shelf life and stability is considerably higher then most oils and rancidity is very rarely a concern. Deep gold in color and with a mild odor.\u201d\r\nThe bottle states:  Jojoba OIL!  and here it stated WAX! AND they advertise a 2 year shelf life, but the email stated 1 year.\r\nDON'T RISK WASTING YOUR MONEY!  I am out about $70, and they suggested that I just purchase more.  ARE THEY KIDDING?

{"text":"I've attended many traditional tea ceremonies, including ones in Japan. In the tea house I went to in Kyoto there was a tea class that explained how to properly prepare matcha. If you are looking for tea to create an authentic ceremony then I would highly recommend this tea. When I prepared this tea it brought me back to the tea house in Kyoto. I would prepare this tea for guests, exchange students, conducting a ceremony, and when teaching about Japanese culture.\r\nAt Japanese tea ceremonies the most important thing is the green tea. Ceremonial tea grade matcha is the highest quality powdered green tea. When you open the container you can see and smell the quality. When I opened this package I could tell that the matcha was great quality. The smell wasn't bitter, but lightly sweet, and it smelled like grass. The power is fine, soft, and pure green. It did not stick to the package sides and slide easily out into the cup. The taste is a mixture of slightly bitter and similar to barley. It also has a unique flavor itself that I can only describe as matcha itself.\r\nWhen you make green tea from powder you need to consider how to make it properly. A cup that is shaped like a bowl is appropriate for traditional ceremonies, and you would need a bamboo whisk to stir the powder and water. It should froth at the top while you whisk, and after you whisk. If you like stronger tea then the entire pouch is good for one cup, but if you don't like strong tea then only use half of it. The water shouldn't be boiling hot, but just before the boiling point. If it is too hot it will take away from the flavor, and if it is too cold it will be extremely bitter and clump together. If you're just drinking this in a regular mug you should be cautious with how strong you are making the matcha, and stir it with a regular utensil. Make sure to stir thoroughly so that you don't leave any clumps in the cup.\r\nWhen drinking this tea you should finish it in one sitting. If you let the tea become cold it will increase in bitterness and become unpleasant. It is rude to not finish a cup of tea during a traditional ceremony, and the last sip should be a long one. If you haven't attended a ceremony but want to prepare one I suggest watching a video first because there are many steps to making the perfect cup of tea. The cup, whisk, scooper, kettle, and tea can make the difference in preparation for a ceremony. With this tea it is important to have the other components be top quality to enjoy the tea at its best.\r\nThis grade of tea doesn't need anything added but water. You shouldn't add sugar to this tea, or lemon, or anything else. If you think it is too bitter then you should eat sweets while drinking it. Youkan is the traditional Japanese bean paste sweet to have with matcha. The sweets will curve the bitterness and make the experience more enjoyable.\r\nIf you are wanting to make green tea ice cream I suggest staying with this brand, but consider using a lower grade of tea. It still works with ceremonial grade, but it seems like a waste to use such high quality tea for something else. Adding some powder on top of vanilla ice cream tastes amazing. There are more uses for green tea than just drinking it, though with this grade of green tea the best way is to drink it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Horror or suspense movies that take place in haunted houses are tough to do. The remake of \"The Haunting\", for example, managed to be too literal and show too much which undermined its effectiveness especially compared to Robert Wise's spare, stark original film which was much more about atmosphere.    Richard Matheson's novel (\"Hell House\")and screenplay for \"The Legend of Hell House\" was something of a homage to Shirley Jackson's novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\" (and Robert Wise's classic film adapted from it \"The Haunting\"). The two novels and films have the same basic premise but go in different directions with them.    Physicist Lionel Barrett (Clive Reville)is hired to investigate the possibility of life after death. The location selected is that of the Belasco House once owned by the imposing Emeric Belasco. According to legend, Belasco was a sexual pervert who tortured his victims and their spirits supposedly still reside inside its walls.    Barrett hires two different mediums to participate in the experiment with him and his wife ((Gayle Hunnicutt). The first psychic is Ben Fischer (the late Roddy MacDowall)a survivor of a previous experiment in the house who reluctantly agrees to participate because he needs the money. The second Florence Tanner (Pamela Franklin)has her own motivation for wanting to join the party.    Shout Factory does a nice job of renovating Hell House for its Blu-ray debut. The film has never looked quite this good--images are quite nice with depth and there's little to no debris evident in this transfer. There are occasionally small scratches and speckles but, on the whole, the film looks quite nice. I was a bit concerned, not because Shout Factory hasn't put out good product before, because this is more of a cult film that wouldn't normally receive the TLC that it deserves.    The audio is clear with the original mono soundtrack receiving a nice sounding transfer. This version does not include the 4.0 mix that Fox made for the DVD. Subtitles are provided in English. The moody score sounds quite nice here as well.    The special features are pretty good as well. They may not be as extensive as what Shout provided for some other releases, but they make up for quantity with quality.    We get a 30 minute interview with director John Hough. Hough has directed a number of b-movie classics and provides insight into his approach in shooting \"The Legend of Hell House\" as well as \"Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry\" another cult classic that he is responsible for.    The second major extra is an audio interview with Pamela Franklin presented as an audio commentary track. While there are long periods of silence, she does provide an interesting contrast to some of Hough's observations.    We also get a photo gallery, vintage radio spots and the theatrical trailer rounding out the extras for this release.    As usual Shout provides us with a reversable cover--the outside is the original theatrical poster while there's newly commission artwork on the reverse.    \"The Legend of Hell House\" is a film that I didn't think would receive a Blu-ray transfer and I've always enjoyed and admired what Hough, Matheson and the cast did with their small budgeted film. I'm a sucker for 70's horror films when they are well made and \"Hell House\" falls into that category. Fans will enjoy this as the transfer is exceptionally good with nice extras.    Recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"There are a lot of things to love about this Little Giant Ladder:\r\n+ The height of the front legs can be adjusted independently from the height of the back legs so that it can be placed on stairs.\r\n+ The top standing platform is large, to provide full support to both feet.\r\n+ The apex has a deep tray for holding small tools.\r\n+ It comes with an Airdeck to attach above the apex that can be used as both a platform for supplies and a handrail (removable when not in use).\r\n+ Included with the Airdeck are bungee cords for hanging tools off the platform.\r\n+ It comes with wheels, so I can drag it around. (No, the wheels don't make contact with the ground when the ladder is open.)\r\n+ The ladder is easy to open and close.\r\n+ Feels solid on the ground, no worries about tipping.\r\nSome information that should be but never is provided with the specs for ladders: at its maximum height, the top standing platform is 67 1\/2\" from the ground. Folded, the ladder is 5' tall and 27\" wide at the base.\r\nThe Airdeck could use some improvement. It's supposed to provide more stability for us when standing on the top platform, but the wobble makes me feel a little nervous. My husband double checked to make sure it was installed correctly. He lost his balance on the way down and grabbed it for support. It held tight, worked like it's supposed to, but we'd both like it better if it felt more solid.\r\nStill, I do like this ladder. We use it to change the light bulbs in our chandeliers, which was always a difficult task before. My husband used to lean an old ladder against the wall and have me stand below to hold it. Now, he can do it all by himself.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This rack is far less sturdy than Thule or Yakima racks, but it does the job.  I have now traveled over 900 miles of interstate driving at 70+ mph with a bike on this rack and no issues.  It did seem to reduce gas mileage 1-2mpg. You just have to be sure to tighten the knob on the upright support before locking the key on it. I made a few modifications to improve stability. I added lockwashers to all the thumbwheel adjustment screw knobs, and I tightened the upright support with a 7\/16\" wrench once in place.  Before placing the bike in the rack, I made sure the bike's brakes were applied by putting bungee cords around them to hold the bike so it couldn't roll forward\/backward.  I used Hose clamps covered with foam pipe insulation to better secure the wheels in addition to the enclosed red nylon straps. After 3 years, the U-channel is bent all to hell but the rack still works. I only put the rack on the car when hauling a bike, because the powder coating is quite thin. I noticed light rust in places where the powder coating scratched off. I suspect if I kept it on the car all the time, it would rust alot more. The initial assembly is a pain.  I stripped a bolt, but extras were provided.  Once it is initially assembled, it is not difficult to install over and over to the factory roof bars of my 2011 Honda Element.  Just don't go through any Drive Thru windows or garages.  Total ground clearance was 9'6\" with a mountain bike atop my Honda Element.  The Aluminum Trek Mountain Bike I put on the rack has a very wide downtube and it was a challenge to open the vertical support wide enough, but I got it to work with some coaxing.  When assembling, make sure to install the vertical support with the lock facing the side of the car you want the rack on.  I think I could fit at least 3 or possibly 4 of these across the top of my Element.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm a grandparent and I needed to protect some cabinets from my visiting granddaughter, but I hate those hook type catches because you have to deal with them forever or until you remove them.  These magnetic hooks have an ON\/OFF feature that makes them perfect for the occasional visits.  Installation is made relatively easy by the template with double sided sticky tape that allows you to properly locate the latch and the catch.  My only complaint is the stick tape isn't sticky enough and the template has a tendency to come off too easily.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I ordered this teapot to replace another glass teapot that I'd had for almost nine years.  I wanted a nice large pot because i love making big batches of herbal tea and sipping them over the course of several hours while the herbs continue to steep. I wanted to get another glass pot for both the aesthetic and the practical. It looks lovely with the tea and it is completely neutral to the flavor.  One reviewer mentioned that this pot is so large that they couldn't just make tea for two -for me that was a selling point!\r\nCons: the lid, which fits perfectly when the tea is hot, is a bit loose when it's lukewarm or cold.  As with any glass teapot, if you aren't careful it will break, though this one has a nice thickness to the glass,  so it's not eggshell fragile.\r\nPros: It is BIG, 1.8 liters! Almost two quarts!  The fine mesh strainer is stainless steel and is deep enough to hold enough tea\/herbs to make a flavorful tea and it won't strand the tea out of the liquid after the first cup.  it's also fine enough for loose leaf peppermint tea, which fell through the previous strainer i had.\r\nIf you drink a lot of tea,  this is one i would recommend.","is_deceptive":false}

The scale is beautiful, and I like the fact that it reads my weight immediately instead of having to \"tap\" it first. The reading seems to be somewhat accurate (although it says I am about 2 lbs lighter than all other scales say). The main problem that I am having out of it is its inconsistency. It will give me one weight one minute, and 20 minutes later it will say that I am 5 lbs heavier or lighter (without eating in that 20 minute period). I am able to keep up with my general weight range on it, but still have to weigh elsewhere for an exact reading. A little disappointing.","is_deceptive":false}

The character, story( such as it is), and art work are appealing and for this \"old\" lady it's not overly challenging in the dexterity department. Just enough to  make things interesting. The frequent save points (bonfires) are a plus, as you never find yourself having to backtrack over huge areas of the game. One minor annoyance is that it is only at the save points that you can reorganize your \"arsenal\" of weapons and other supplies and space in the \"briefcase\" is limited. This means frequent trips back to the nearest bonfire to open \"mystery items\" and replace \"broken\" weapons, etc. It may not be a game for super sophisticated and agile gamer, but for the casual player, it's good fun.","is_deceptive":false}

I have tried all of the recommended ideas such as using a different outlet, not using a power strip, making sure they aren't too far apart etc. Once they stopped working I read some of the reviews on Amazon and discovered this product has failed for many people after a short period of time. I contacted the seller, FamilySafe, and they initially offered 30% off the purchase price. Unacceptable since it had completely failed and needed to be replaced within the first year of use.

{"text":"Although this bassinet is sometimes billed as a safe alternative to co-sleeping, it's also just a fabulous option for mainstreamers. Breastfeeding is wonderful, but it's also hard work - anything you can do to make it more convenient for mom is a great thing!\r\nI bought this for use with my newborn son.  To me, wanting to keep him close at night was very instinctive, but I wanted to ensure a safe way of doing it and a way that would eventually facilitate an easy-ish transition to crib sleeping.\r\nI especially wanted to be able to have easy access to him during the night so that he could nurse. This bassinet makes nighttime nursing as unobtrusive as possible. I hear my son as he wakes up and begins lightly fussing, and can get him out before he can escalate to crying.  I grab him, nurse him, and put him back to bed without really waking up at this point (extremely helpful when he decides to nurse nearly every hour because of a growth spurt!). I can easily see if he's making noises in his sleep versus awake and fussing - saves me a trip out of bed. The close proximity also gave me peace of mind in the beginning because I could check his breathing!\r\nWe have two dogs who sleep on my husband's side of the bed; the co-sleeper makes me feel like my baby is separate from them and safe (they're great dogs, but I prefer to err on the side of caution).\r\nWe use the leg extenders, which do as they say. They do make it slightly less stable, but I feel totally confident that the construction is solid. The wheels on one end are a nice touch.\r\nWhen setting up the bassinet, be sure to step down hard on all the sides - they're stiff and can easily be mistaken for locked when they're not.\r\nThis bassinet does not collapse easily. We didn't buy it for that purpose, but it's still of note. I tried to collapse it for the first time last week to go to my parents' house and I felt like I was wrestling a bear! I had to watch a video online to get an idea of how to even do it. I'm hopeful that it might get easier the more I do it.\r\nThe mattress is definitely hard, but it's supposed to be. My little guy doesn't seem to mind!\r\nIt's handy that there are pockets on each end and I love the large storage compartment underneath. We keep extra sheets, extra leg extenders, an extra boppy cover, and more in there and there's tons of room to spare.\r\nI like the tan dot, it blends into our room and doesn't seem to take up a lot of space.\r\nOverall, a great option for babies and for saving parents getting out of bed repeatedly to get a baby when they're exhausted. Will continue to use this with my son until he grows out of it and plan to save it in hopes of baby number 2 in a few years.","is_deceptive":false}

I purchased the mint and the pink geometic dots.

I change my daughter's sheets two or three times a week on average, and I only have 5 sheets that fit her bed, so they get washed A LOT. In all those washings the colors on these have not faded, there are no holes, and the elastic is still working great.

However, it was shortlived because it stopped working properly on the second night.

The are merely tubes of fabric.  Perhaps this contributes to why they do not stay on very well?\r\n- Foot rattles keep coming off.  There is minimal elasticity in the socks and they keep sliding down.  Even over socks they just keep sliding down.  When my son starts moving his feet around the rattles are hanging off or just come off altogether.\r\n- Rattles are a bit too quiet.\r\n- The wrist rattle cuffs are a bit on the small side.\r\n- The foot rattles are a bit on the large side.\r\n~CONCLUSION~\r\nI think the it is a great concept, but definitely could be executed better.\r\nUnfortunately, my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles.

Rourke was shockingly mellow in this drama, usually he plays some sort of bad guy, but here he's more of a doormat.

{"text":"I couldn't put down this fast-paced, honest, young-at-heart memoir. The characters are as real in this story as I'm sure they are in the author's experience. Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.\r\nFrustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.\r\nIt's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road. This book a story of teaching and partying in a small village in Taiwan, but it's really a story of friendship, patience, and the best time ever.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This is only my second LCD t.v. and my first edge-lit LED.  It is also the first time I bought a Sony television.  My wife wanted to try since she really buys into the idea that Sony is simply more dependable.  And we were both happily surprised to find this 40-inch LED at roughly the same price as the corresponding Samsung model.  I was a little worried given that it is a new model and not very much reviewed yet.  But, hey, Sony right?\r\nFor the most part, it's a great set.  The apps work surprisingly well given how bad wifi streaming is on a lot of Smart televisions.  The picture is fantastic from the right distance.  Sound is strong.  4 HDMI ports is amazing along with 2 USB ports so you can power a chromecast without plugging it into the wall.  Set up was easy.  The set is incredibly light.  All the ports worked and the menus react quickly.\r\nThere are two noteworthy problems.\r\nThe first seems to be a design flaw.  The power supply plugs into the back of the television in a very insecure manner.  It just barely clicks into place and the slightest touch can jar it loose.  Once you're set up this may not be a problem, but if you ever have to mess with anything in the back of the set, it will turn off on you and the plug may just outright fall out of its place.  Kind of amazing give how basic \"power supply\" is to product design. The chord between the t.v. and the power brick is also way too short and if you place the t.v. on a somewhat tall t.v. stand, the brick will need to be taped to something or supported somehow.  This is only compounded by the problem with the plug as the weight of the brick will easily pull the plug out of the back of the t.v. if it isn't secured. So, electrical tape may be your t.v. companion!\r\nThe second problem is more annoying and seems to be a manufacturing flaw in the set I was shipped, which is disappointing given that we went with Sony exactly to avoid just that.  There are visible blotches of light that appear near the bottom of the screen on any white or light-colored surface that is moving (like when watching a hockey game or soccer match).  It is very distracting in those situations but not noticeable in most others (like watching a movie).  You can also see them pretty clearly on any solid background that is somewhat light.  It's true that uneven light or backlight \"bleeding\" is fairly common in LED's, but amazingly, in this case, if you get close to the screen and look down toward the bottom edge, you can see a second screen behind the front panel, some sort of thin plastic screen that is meant to diffuse and distribute the light evenly.  You can see that is is curved away from the panel in one spot at the bottom, just to the right of the Sony logo.  It is supposed to be straight and flush against the edge and stretched tight.  It is also supposed to be invisible to the eye I would guess.  But instead it is sort of \"warped\" or wrinkled in this one place, or maybe just wasn't set in place properly so you can see it behind the main panel.  I'm pretty sure this wrinkle is causing the waves of uneven light just above it, along with a little dark splotch near that spot.\r\nIt's only been two days and I don't think I'm going to exchange it.  It is only distracting in certain situations and some uneven lighting is just a common issue with edge-lit LEDs.  I figure that the next one will likely have some other slight issue or other and I don't care to be one of those Amazon customers that cycles through product after product over fairly minor glitches until I get one that is perfect, especially when it comes to something as finicky as the edge-lit LED t.v.s that seem to be a bit of a lottery.  But it is disappointing to see such an obvious and easily detectable manufacturing flaw as a warped diffusion (or whatever it is) screen show up in a product that is a pretty big ticket item for us ($500 is nothing to snuffle at).\r\n<br\/>I have no reason to think that this is a common issue and, in fact, searching around I've found no mention of anything like it with this or other models.\r\nMeanwhile our other t.v. is a five-year-old \"budget\" Samsung that has had a perfect picture from the moment we got it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I found this vacuum easy to put together.  It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.\r\nIt IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.\r\nFeatures I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON\/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on\/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers.\r\n Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range. I've used it about a month and haven't noticed a decrease, if it doesn't last over time, I'll update this review.\r\nMY DISLIKES:  It's bulky and big to store, and it is heavy.

It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all.

You don't have to program it, you don't have to teach it your habits, you don't have to debug it after a power outage, and you don't have to fight it when you want change.  You just push the button for what you want.\r\nThe thermostat uses standard wire connection codes so swapping it in is effortless - wire it the same way the previous one was wired.  Activation thresholds, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature can be reprogramed to match your home system if needed.  The default thresholds work fine for me.  I lowered the maximum temperature so my house won't cook if the \"up\" button gets stuck.\r\nWhat would make this perfect would be different cover plates for the mode slider switch to represent different hookups.

It takes some care to not slide the switch too far into a non-working position.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"If you are wanting to get more vegetables in your diet, these fusion drinks which combine fruit juices with vegetable juices are a savvy way to do so. This peach mango mixes the juice of sweet potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and yellow carrots with the juice of white grapes, apples, oranges, peaches and mango puree. You really taste the peach-mango flavor with the other subtle flavors as nuances.\r\nIt is 100% juice with no ADDED sugar. However, it does include natural fruit sugar, as all juices do, which is part of the fruit juice - 26g sugar in a one cup serving. What I like to do is use about 1\/8 cup - which would be about 3.5g of fruit sugar and 20 calories - and put it in a cup of seltzer with ice to make a refreshing and healthy drink. One cup of this fruit-vegetable fusion drink is 120 calories, but you can dilute it with seltzer to give it fizz and less calories for a refreshing, healthy and tasty beverage. It provides 100% of daily vitamin C and 20% vitamin A in one serving.\r\nIt's a great concept to mix fruit and vegetable juices in a healthy fusion drink like this which is naturally delicious. Of all the V8fusion drinks, this is one of my favorites. Mango and peach together are so refreshing and rather tropical tasting.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The maker of this diet claims the following about NRG Maxim Grainless Dog Food Diet on the website:\r\n\"It is goodness you can actually see, not just when you read the label, but from the moment you open the box and recognize shredded fruits and vegetables like in your own trail mix.Enzyme active fresh fruits and vegetables provide enriched immune system support. Vegetable based carbohydrates combine with dietary fats to supply energy in a balance that does not stress the pancreas. Not only is meat the first ingredient, it is more than 1\/2 the formulaFor everyday convenience NRG is the refreshing way to provide enzyme rich whole food nourishment...NO SHORT CUTS...Quality without compromise...\r\nThe Best Raw Food Value...1 KG of dry measure Maxim is caloricly equal to 10 lbs of frozen food.\"\r\nMy notes:\r\nShredded fruits and veggies are simply filler and are not digested by dogs. On the other hand, the powdered, raw veggies and fruit that the manufacturer knocks will offer some enzymes, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, etc. Sadly the shredded produce in this product is simply a great way to waste your money ($15\/lb for something that costs the manufacturer $1\/lb). I am not against people making money, but I am against deceptive marketing. This product is better than a lot of pet foods, just don't fool yourself into thinking it's better than a home-prepared or commercial, frozen raw diet.\r\nAs for meat being \"more than 1\/2 the formula...\" I should hope so. Exactly when did it become acceptable to make meat and animal products less than 95% of the diet of a carnivore?\r\nAs for this product being the best raw food value, I have to laugh. Even if the wet (\"frozen\") weight equaled 4.5 times the dry weight of the finished product you're still only getting about 50% meat.\r\nUPDATE: Years after posting this review I have finally found a freeze-dried raw diet that is worth it's price. I've been feeding \"The Real Meat\" freeze dried,grass-fed, New Zealand beef formula and think it is far more sensible than the NRG. The Real Meat has as much as 35% more beef, and the cost is about 35% more (when you buy the 4lb bag). Because it's mostly beef and has no undigestible ingredients, it's more energy dense, and more efficient to store. Pound for pound, when comparing the beef portion of the diet, the cost for \"The Real Meat\" freeze dried beef is the same as NRG.  In my opinion, The Real Meat is better quality as it's pasture-raised beef. New zealand is known for it's beautiful, green pastures and delicious, healthy beef. In addition to the beef being a better quality, the food is boosted with vitamins, kelp, and supplements that might help a lot of pets.\r\nI am not bashing NRG, if you notice I have always given it 3 stars. Those of you who accuse me of having a conflict of interest, ought to back off a bit. I just want pet food companies to make better food and make and supply it in the most efficient manner (no filler ingredients). My only wish is for animals to be healthier and the best way to go about this is to help their owners afford really nutritious food.\r\nI just noticed this statement on the NRG beef description and wanted to add a comment for safety reasons:\r\n\"Why feed messy inconvenient raw diets that require diligent food safety practices when you can simply add water to create the ultimate balanced fresh, raw no grain dog food ration for your canine. \"\r\nIf NRG is raw and not pasteurized, then the second it is rehydrated it needs to be treated just as a fresh\/frozen raw food would be. In other words, if you feel it's imperative to wash your dog's bowl after he eats raw meat, you should also do so after feeding NRG. There may be an innactivation of the bacteria while it is dry, but once those bacteria are in a moist environment, many will be revived. My advice is to use Puregreen24  to wipe down bowls after each meal if you don't have time to put them through the dishwasher.","is_deceptive":false}

Some labelers don't have this often overlooked frustration saver.  -Can print up to 2 lines of text per label, a space saving feature I use often.    -Printing different languages seems to be a strong suit of this labeler.  It comes with many different fonts with everything from accent marks to umlauts.  -Changing batteries and inserting different label tape is easy and intuitive.  -Uses 6 easy to find AAA batteries.

My brother is huge and he says they fit fine. I can wear these for 4 or so hours before starting to feel pain from the headband and clamp,(which is kind of hard not to have for this type of headphone). This wasn't a big issue for me because I only use them a couple of hours at a time, and I was willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for quality, and even at that they are still pretty darn comfortable! Overall there isn't much clamp, it just builds up after uaing them for a long time. The ears themselves are comfortable (lined with a soft cushion) and provide AMAZING isolation!! These babies made the airplane drone sound like a gentle hum. The quality is superb if you're moving from Apple earbuds or Skullcandy's or beats--the beats really are bad quality for their price--anyway, music sounds clear and crisp and gives a bit of a soundstage effect. Drums can sometimes sound a little punchy, and there can be a big bass but both arent overwhelming. They are big so if portability is a must, these might not be for you, though the ears do fold over and it does come with a chic travel case...You just cant put them in your sweatshirt pocket or anything. DO NOT GET THE S CABLE IF YOU ONLY WANT TO USE THEM FOR YOUR COMPUTER\/IPOD. I made that mistake and I had to get an adapter, which was only $7 from Radio Shack, but I'm not downrating the product as that mistake was my own. I don't think a headphone ampilfier is needed for these, but they do sound better after some useage. I've had these headphones for 6 months now, and I don't think I'll be changing headphones for a long long time =)\r\n-Andy","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We had this monitor only about a week, but have been using it very frequently. So far, we LOVE this monitor! The night vision is excellent, and I am surprised by how much I love the push to talk feature- we are transitioning our daughter to sleeping in her crib and physically going in to calm her down just makes her more mad, but talking to her via push to talk works perfectly! Also love that you can play lullabies remotely (fyi the lullabies do not 'time out').  In reading reviews I came across two common complaints on popular video monitors that I would like to address in reference to this video monitor- you CAN turn the volume all the way down on this monitor if you just want to see your child and not hear him\/her (we have a small house turning on the volume is overkill) and if you have it plugged in, the video part of the monitor will stay on(for example, I leave mine plugged in on my nightstand- it also has quite a long cord so it will reach far-away outlets).    The only three minor issues I have so far is that this does not have a belt clip and my pockets are too small to carry it around, it does have a little kickstand so you can prop it up on a flat surface, though. Although we can see most of the crib, we have been unable so far to angle the camera (and have not figured out how to mount it) so that we can see ALL of the crib, although I do not think any monitor would have been able to give us a 100% full view of the crib, due to the layout of our nursery. My husbands biggest gripe is that the zoom is not a variable zoom- the only options under zoom are 1x and 2x and because this model cannot tilt and pan remotely, it makes it pretty much useless unless your child is in exactly the right position\/you have positioned the monitor perfectly.    ** UPDATE 3 months later: Still love it! I make sure to turn off both parts of the monitor while not in use as it was suggested by other reviewers that that may contribute to some of the units prematurely malfunctioning. I did notice that if you play the lullabies via the monitor for very long, it gets pretty warm (warm enough to perhaps damage the unit if it was too warm too often too long, but not warm enough to do damage to anything else).    ** UPDATE almost 2 years later: Still love it. I am certain there are better monitors out there now, but we are sticking with this one, in fact, we are going to buy an additional camera for baby #2!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am a fan of this company.  The Tuft & Needle mattress changed my life!  I'd forgotten what it felt like to get a decent night's sleep until I spent the first night on my Queen 10 mattress.  I've been sleeping on it for 20 nights and I am so pleased to finally have a comfortable bed - one that fully supports me and doesn't impact me at the pressure points.  Before this mattress I was waking up stiff and sore and feeling like a 95 year old woman rather than my 63 years.  Plus, I immediately stopped having the chronic nocturnal leg and feet cramps that were making me feel desperate for the lack of sleep they created.  I still get a few, probably due to the stress in my life, but nothing like it was was.  I didn't order from Amazon even though I am a huge Amazon fan and found all the reviews extremely helpful because I wanted to check out this company directly. The whole experience with Tuft & Needle has been great.  The ordering was seamless and my mattress arrived 5 days after I ordered it online. I have had numerous email exchanges with the staff at Tuft & Needle that have all been heartfelt and gratifying. It was obvious that if I ultimately didn't like the mattress it would be no issue at all to return it - an experience you can't get from a regular mattress store.  Friends of mine immediately bought one based on my excitement and experience, and they too are loving the mattress.  I am very sensitive to odors and found the smell of this mattress to be very mild and quite tolerable the first night and it has since dissipated.  It is a firm mattress and yet it still feels wonderful because it supports while managing the pressure points.  I applaud Tuft & Needle for the company they created and their commitment to selling an excellent product at a very fair price, while totally appreciating their customers!  Thank you for improving my life!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Philips PB9011 portable Blu-Ray DVD Player is a pretty good option for the back seat of a car, but it doesn't offer much more than less expensive players unless you are committed to Blu-Ray discs.  Pros:  - They generally do what they are supposed. They provide an ok movie watching experience for the back seat.  - 9\" screens are on the bigger side for portable players intended for the car.  - The carrying case fits everything perfectly and easily. No jamming stuff into place or having to figure out what should go where. It really is well done. With kids, it is important that things can easily be put away properly.  - As the name says, it plays Blu-Ray discs. In reality, the quality on this player doesn't allow Blu-Rays do much more than a DVD, but if you already have a Blu-Ray disc, you can still play it in the car with the PB9011. In the past, we had to limit ourselves to DVD's just in case we wanted to watch the movie in the car at some point. Nice!  Cons:  - You can only watch one movie at a time. The second screen is only a slave to the primary. The other (much less expensive) portable DVD players that we have can work as a pair or independently.  - The volume control is a physical dial on the side of the player, so it can't be controlled by remote and it requires a little more fidgeting than a digital volume control.  - The sound is ok but not great. It sounds much more like mono than stereo and doesn't get very loud without deteriorating.  - The screen washes out in sunlight. In the back seat of a car, it is tough to control going into and out of sunlight. These screens don't do well with that.  - The cables are quite a mess in the back of the car, but that is hard to avoid with a pair of portable screens.  - The remote control feels flimsy. We'll see how it holds up.  - The screens don't tilt on their backings like our other players do. If the angle is off for the person watching the movie, you have to play with how it is strapped to the headrest insteadof just tilting it up or down.","is_deceptive":false}

This timepiece from Citizen, actually does more to confuse the owner than drive in regards to the overall value of the piece. It does have a lovely leather strap and significant movement, but that is really all there is to it. What I do not like about the watch is that you see the watch in 3 directions. The second display seems much bigger on the watch, while the regular time display, and the military display seem much smaller and weaker on the watch. Overall, it is a noble watch, but there are better ones Citizen has made overall for the money.\r\nPrice: C-\r\nSetup & Comfort: C+\r\nOverall: C","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Just what we needed is another high school reunion romantic comedy featuring mostly impossibly good looking former classmates, all with some hang-ups or dragged baggage.  The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.\r\nChanning Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.  Once there he finds his old high school sweetheart, Mary (Rosario Dawson) along with her new husband (Ron Livingston) in tow.  Then we have drunken party boy Cully (Chris Pratt) and his disapproving wife (Ari Graynor).  Also Lynn Collins as the former high school party girl, still trying to live up to that image, but with a secret.  Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.  One of the more interesting pairings is Oscar Isaac as Reeves who has become a famous pop star whose long ago crush on Elise (Kate Mara) has been reignited.\r\nIf this all sounds all too formulaic, well it is.  On the other hand the performances are solid enough and there are enough chuckles and bubbling emotions to keep the audience interested for 90 minutes.  Watchable but also forgettable.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.\r\nJesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?\r\nIn between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.\r\nIn analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.\r\nThis is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a REALLY GREAT buy.  To try to help everybody really enjoy this product, just a few notes.  First off on the condition:\r\nThe condition is really perfect because of the packaging Fender uses.  So damage should never be a problem.  If you see a torn carton though, then worry.\r\nThen on to as advertised:  I thought it would come with a whammy bar, but it is only built for the whammy bar, so you need the bar.  Otherwise the Guitar and the bag are exactly as advertised.  The cloth bag is one of the better bags I've seen over the years.\r\nBIG and IMPORTANT notes:  The neck bar comes loose with minimum pressure.  After bringing the guitar to tune you will need to tighten the neck bar with a 3\/16\" allen wrench about 3 turns or so till the neck comes straight by looking down the neck\/frets from behind\/beside the tuners.  I had to also adjust the string length on the E,A and G strings.  If you don't want to deal with those issues, I think Guitar Center\/Guitar shops do setups for 15 - 25 bucks.  I would definitely do that for the guitar within the 30 day warranty to make sure the guitar is within specs anyway.  The point of this whole thing though, is the guitar comes not set up.  To really enjoy it either set it up or have it setup.\r\nOtherwise, this is a hot little guitar that has an absolutely stunning sound.  I'm enjoying it greatly!","is_deceptive":false}

The dust ruffle easily adjusts to three different heights. The blanket is a nice medium weight, perfect for year round use. One side is solid, and one has an understated diamond motif. There was no shrinkage when the set was laundered.\r\nThis set is a nice gift when you are unsure of the baby's gender or the nursery decor.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Original review: Jan. 3, 2014    So, I moved across the country, didn't have a bed for 3.5 years, was building up my new life in a new place... I finally got a bed,this bed, and I am so happy I got it. When I ordered it they just ran out, so I had to wait for them to get their next shipment in, it was no big deal as DynastyMattress had communicated with me quickly and promptly. The mattress was wildly skinny in the air tight plastic bag, rolled up in the torn up box, yes I see many get a torn up box, but what's inside is doubled up in plastic, so no big deal.     So... The mattress is wonderful! It's definitely 15 inches, and it's very comfy, a bit more firm then what I expected and not too firm, but the truth is that I like it just the way it is. My mattress was very new, as I said I had to wait for them to get their new shipment, so I expected to have that chemical smell, it was strong for two days, died a lot on the 3rd day, and in two weeks it is completely gone. Make sure you have sheets that fit, cause 15 inch's is thick for a mattress. I am very happy with this quality product. Although I did carry it up a flight of stairs, dragged it into my room, and placed it on my bed, I don't recommend you doing that alone, it was a strain due to its awkward shape and heavy weight! I also bought the \"Sleep Master - Platform Metal Bed Frame\/Foundation - Perfect for Spring, Latex, and Memory Foam Mattresses\" metal bed frame and it is brilliant, more under-bed space, and very strong. Just search that in Amazon and you'll find it. Works GREAT.    UPDATE: Sept. 8th, 2014    So I have had the mattress for some 20 months now. I did worry about it getting to warm, due to reviews I have read. Because of that worry I bought the thickest one they offered, the 15in mattress. I think this was a very smart decision for me as I don't really encounter much of a heat issue. I don't have my AC on when I sleep at night, and I work late, therefore I wake up late. When I wake up the temperature outside is already in the 90's, and I'm a little warm, but nothing like what others are saying. I am pretty sure it's cause I bought the thickest mattress, more are in the mattress is able to breath through.     As everyone knows, it's Temporpedic that is constantly being the brand compared to other foam mattress'. Temporpedic has a patent on their process and foam structure and density, their mattress' are a lot heavier. Due to the patent issued, other brands can't made as dense a foam mattress. They do other tings to compensate, and in this 15in mattress, they give us 7.5 inches of actual memory foam, and the rest is layers of other materials to help spread the \"breathing\".     I have slept in this bed for all 20 months with the exception of a one week vacation. My mattress has not \"sunken\" in or failed on me in any way. I'm 155 lbs too. I don't expect it to last as long as a temporpedic due to it being less dense, as per patent, but it is going to be here for a long time.     I should note, I bought this mattress under duress due to a major surgery I was about to have. I wanted to make sure I was able to sleep well and in a bed during my recovery. As silly as it sounds, a foam mattress can be really tricky getting in and out of due to the type of surgery I had, abdomen and intestines. So, I had to literally roll out and roll in the bed for 8 months, but I tell ya, once I \"rolled in\" during my recovery, I was so extremely comfortable, I slept so well and did not have to, nor need to, move my body position ever during the night. I think this helped with my expected 18 month recovery become just 8 months...     I have noticed the latest reviews seem to be low, not sure if the latest batch of mattress made had a defect in them, but I think it should be checked into cause this is a great bed!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I approached this movie with huge anticipation.  The director, Jee-woon Kim, has directed some PHENOMENAL Korean movies.  The cinematography in his movies I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad, and the Weird is simply some of the best cinematography I've seen in any movie anywhere (American movies included).  If you don't mind subtitles (and you shouldn't) check both of those out.\r\nSo I was excited that Mr. Kim's American debut was going to be Arnold's return to the big screen.  The previews looked promising and fun.  But something about the movie just felt...off.  None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters.  it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent.\r\nOverall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Can a person change?\r\nIn this movie, King's Faith, Brendan King shows us how.  A troubled teen, Brendan has just gotten out of juvie and is placed in the foster home of a couple, the Stubbs, who recently lost their son, a police officer.  Mr. Stubbs' faith in God allows him to be close to Brendan right away, but his wife Vanessa is still angry and bitter after the loss of their son that she cannot find it in her heart to even try.  As Brendan assimilates to high school he finds joy in serving with other members of the Faith Club and together they decide raise money to transform Brendan's old inner-city house into a safe haven for troubled youth.  Along the way Brendan meets another troubled soul...  a homecoming queen who is not much unlike himself.  As they all work together to change the lives of inner city kids, Brendan's old gang comes skulking around determined to beat out of Brendan the location of a hidden stash of drugs.  As he refuses the gang starts bullying his friends, going so far as to run Brendan's best friend down while he was riding his bike.  With no where left to turn, Brendan fears he has no other options but to give them what they want...  Or does he?  With help from his new friends Brendan realizes that \"if you stand firm in your faith, anything is possible.\"  I was on the edge of my seat wondering how Brendan was going to extricate himself from a tough situation while remaining true to his newfound faith.\r\nThis movie was really good.  In the special featurrette \"behind the scenes\" the producers discuss that this was a low-budget movies, but you can't tell it.  It is very well made. Some of the acting was a little, well, corny and parts of it to me moved a little slow, but I believe this movie will resonate with teenagers and young adults.  James and I joked about how much we DID NOT miss High School while viewing this movie.  Being a teen was SO hard.  There are a lot of teens who are hurting and lost and I do notenvy anyone who is trying to be a teenager today.  Be aware that this movie is rated PG-13 unlike most movies of this genre.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It truly shocks me that people with labs (and other aggressive chewing breeds) think this toy will hold up with their dogs and then write bad reviews on it when it doesn't. Come on people, you know your dogs! If you have a strong chewer, you should know a plush toy like this (or ANY plush toy for that matter!) will never hold up under all the punishment and abuse their love of chewing and tearing will dish out. This is not meant for strong chewers and rippers. No plush toy is. So please don't trash this excellent dog toy because you made a poor decision based on your dog's breed.\r\nThe fact is, this is a GREAT toy for light to moderate chewers. It's very well made and holds up great as long as you don't have an aggressive chewer. My Pembroke Corgi adores hers and spends many happy evenings playing with it. I love that it allows us to play together since I do have to 'restuff' the log every so often. But that's a nice way to spend time with my puppy and we both enjoy how fun this toy is.\r\nHonestly, this is one toy you can't go wrong with as long as you know your dog and don't buy it for an aggressive chewer.

I prefer that larger Oxo squeezer for juicing many limes (necessary when the limes are dry, or for margaritas). The Oxo can also handle lemons easily.    In case you haven't used this kind of squeezer (previous to my Oxo, I used a reamer), it takes far less effort than reaming, and keeps the acidic juice off your skin.    The green color of this squeezer is a nice way to make it obvious what this tool is for, and the small size is a benefit for space-constrained kitchens.

Great stuff!!!!!\r\nMy personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.\r\n1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.\r\n2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.\r\n3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a \"fat burner\" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.\r\n4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.\r\n5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.\r\n6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.\r\nMy hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised!

Good editing and proofreading; the pacing and order are off and a few of the plot devices are not believable. I certainly stumbled with the air car, implant, and oh-so-holy roller government moles. On the other hand, I loved the sacred geometry, the trek to Tibet, and implications for the future of mankind.

{"text":"These D&D board games are really fun. I don't have time to play real D&D any more, the days on having 8 hours free on the weekend are long gone. But this is a nice alternative. It is basically D&D, but the player characters are set in advance. You don't have to look up stuff in guides, because info about armor class and damage and spells and such, are all on the playing cards. Nobody has to play the role of Dungeon Master, because the encounter\/instructions tell you what all the monsters do, who they go after, etc. It is also random each time, because the way you place the board tiles and draw cards, it makes it different. There are a zillion parts\/pieces, so I recommend you get a little case with subdividers to hold everything, or else get a bunch of ziplock bags.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.  I had really high hopes for it as the functionality that is listed in the description really makes it sound like a great point and shoot camera.  I have experience with lots of different digital cameras, from the more sophisticated D-SLR cameras to the simplest disposables.  So I was really let down with this one.\r\nFirst off, for the casual user who just wants a simple point and shoot camera, I would not recommend this.  Panasonic did a horrible job of making the basic camera functions as complex as possible, requiring several steps to making adjustments that other cameras innately have available with one click or turn of a dial.  However, even if this wasn't an issue, which after a few days of use it became a little easier to remember where certain features were located, the biggest problem that I have with this camera overall is the horrible delay between pressing the shutter release button and time it takes the camera to snap the photograph.  This drove me crazy on my old freebie smart phone, so when this decently priced camera did it I was really shocked.  Basically what happens is you go to take a picture of say your children, so you line them up, tell them to smile, and push the button, you can almost count to two before the camera takes the picture.  At this point everyone has moved and the picture comes out all wrong or blurry.  It's really a shame.  I even switched the setting over to \"action\" so that it would increase the shutter speed time, and the results were exactly the same.  So if you tried to use the \"action\" mode to catch a thrilling shot at a sporting event or something, the picture would be about two seconds later than the one you tried to take!  At that timing, what's the point?\r\nI tried playing with the \"WINK\" setting for taking selfies, and that also needs some more engineering from Panasonic.  It works, but barely.  After setting the camera to take a picture using a \"wink\" (in the same menu as the countdown mode) you have to really be patient with it, and stand there looking like a crazy person winking slowly at your camera in an over emphasized manner in order for the camera to start a 3 second countdown to take the picture.  Even then, I could only get it to take a picture once every ten or so attempts.  Or you could just set the camera to countdown mode, press the shutter button, and the 3 second countdown happens exactly the same way.\r\nFor more experienced photographers, Panasonic didn't help you out either.  The manual settings for adjusting aperture and shutter speed require four different steps, toggling between menu functions in order to make your adjustments.  It really shouldn't be that difficult to do these kind of changes, and really wastes a lot of good opportunities by forcing you to do them.\r\nThere are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This broke after two days of use. The grip on the handle is just thin foam with a bar that goes through it into a hole on either side of the handle. Originally, the little bar had some flange style stuff going on so that the bar for the grip wouldn't fall off. Those wore away very quickly (I drink a lot of canned seltzer water) and soon the bar fell out which makes the two opposing pieces of the handle separate and go all wonky and uncoordinated. The Good News!: I put the bar in it's rightful place and wrapped the handle (leaving enough room for my hand to move around on the grip as the fulcrum force is applied) with packing tape very tightly and it has since been working like a dream. I love it now. Saves me tons of space in my trash can, but ultimately the can is heavier as there are more cans in it since they fit better crushed.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"First off i am writing this review as of 3\/3\/13 and after a few weeks of use and the newest firmware update.\r\nAs I'm sure you've seen there are many complaints about this headset in regards to the bugs it had at launch. Its very unfortunate that these were present as it irritated a lot of people but as of this writing THIS HEADSET IS AMAZING.\r\nI've owned a lot of headphones and headsets in my life, from cheap to mid rage audiophile headsets on multiple gaming and listening machines. I am currently using these on both PS3, Xbox 360 and PC and LOVE them on all 3. Ive gamed online with friends and voice quality is clear and loud using all stock cables. Some complained that the stock usb cable was reason for the bad voice but i seem to have no issue with it.\r\nSo besides the fact that I've had none of the issues mentioned in older reviews ill hit a few reasons why i love the hell out of these cans.\r\nBuild quality.\r\nPrevious to these my Sennheiser HD595's and HD600's were the best built headphones I've experienced and the Astro's are just as good if not maybe a bit sturdier. The metal adjustment posts are a wonderful touch along with the strong composite materials. It truly feels like a premium headset. The cables also seem very well made and are extremely light and flexible. My room mate tested these on Xbox and i had to point out the fact that there was a cable hooked to the controller. He didnt even notice it. The ear cups are also very roomy and though the headset has some heft to it, you find yourself forgetting youre wearing it.\r\nSound.\r\nMy god these were a surprise in this field. Although the mids lack some of the clarity of the HD595's and 600s the high range is beautiful and the lows very rich and natural. The high range is especially impressive on all EQ settings and i at first thought i had forgot to turn off my surround sound when clicking through the menus on my PS3 because the \"click\" noise was so crisp and felt like it was coming from all around me. Speaking of EQ's I've heard that Astro is soon rolling out an EQ customizer for the Mixamp. The 4 supplied are a great touch but that will really be a huge feature. Footsteps and gun shots are amazingly clear and stand out very well on \"Pro Mode.\" Definitely a plus for FPS games.\r\nThe small touches are also amazing on these. Detachable headset cable, detachable mic, all the extra cable ports on the Mixamp among other things make these extremely versatile. From gaming to listening to music on my computer, to listening to music with my phone minus the Mixamp these cans do it all.\r\nSo yes they had some problems at first. But If you're reading this now, don't worry about it. Great job to Astro on these they've won a customer.","is_deceptive":false}

There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.\r\n\u201cSafe Haven\u201d is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance \u201cDear John\u201d a few years ago), \u201cSafe Haven\u201d is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.\r\nFor \u201cSafe Haven\u201d attempts to be a \u201cmystery\u201d \u2013 in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie\u2019s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.\r\nThe film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I read this book 2 1\/2 years ago, loved it then, still love it now!  I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.\r\nBesides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.\r\nThey are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, .

{"text":"We do a lot of cooking and we have quite a few stainless steel knives of various sizes in the kitchen. Over the years, some of these knives have become pretty dull. We have tried all sorts of sharpeners - stones and the like - and nothing really worked. I read the reviews on this one and they were good. Because the price is right, I decided to give it a try - If this was no better than the others we have tried, I was only out a few dollars.\r\nWell, this sharpener is amazing! I cannot believe how well it works. I took the dullest knives we had, set this sharpener on the counter top facing up, and then ran a knife through the slot a few times. you could feel the bite of the sharpening stone against the blade and actually see metal filings falling onto the counter top. This thing was doing some serious work. After 4 swipes or so, I cleaned off the blade and tried to run it through a ripe tomato I had on the counter - wow - just like using a razor blade on the tomato. It sliced through like butter. This knife has never been so sharp. I did all my knives with the same results.\r\nThis is an amazing sharpener. The directions are simple. I don't know how well it works for ax blades or other things, but it sure works good on kitchen knives. A+ for me.","is_deceptive":false}

Most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down.\r\nWe had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind, so I can't vouch for leaking issues, but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that.\r\nI was VERY pleased with this tent.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A decent coffee maker with lots of room for improvement.  It does K-cups, one cups, or a pot, but none of them well.    Pros    1. Flexibility - you can brew coffee by all three methods.  2. Price - This is cheap for what it is. (As long as you can get it for less than 70)  3. Size - It's not too large for what it does.  4. Programmable - Unexpected bonus at this price range.    Cons    1. Horrific plastic smell and taste.  It takes forever to get rid of it.  I had to run five full pots of White Vinegar and water to get rid of it.    2. One cups are horribly messy and tons of grounds make it into your coffee.  3. K-Cups are on the slow side, but not too bad.  4. You can only put in the water you want to use at that moment.  You cannot fill the basin and brew whatever you want. If you want a k-cup, you have to measure out the water.    Overall this is an okay coffee maker.  With some improvements it could be a great coffee maker.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I do not often give a video game five stars, but this one earned it.  Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare on the PS4 is an excellent game.  You will enjoy it, as long as you know what you are buying.  The first thing you need to know, is that this is a multi-player game.  This is not a game with multi-player.  ALL MODES are essentially multi-player.    The two main sections are a co-op, base defense game that is very similar to the Mass Effect 3 multi-player.  The other section is a straight up vs. mode.    Normally I hate competitive vs. multi-player.  This game is different.  They do an excellent job keeping the playing field level.  It's difficult for one or two players to brutalize the other players, as is so common in many multi-player modes.    They did an excellent job mixing up characters.  They are diverse and enjoyable.  They are so well balanced that I do not have a favorite class yet.    This is a third person shooter which sounds violent.  However, they do it in a manner that is not gory.  This game is safe for kids and fun for adults.    PROS:    Approachable for people who have never played multi-player games.    Great graphics even if they are cartoonish.    Clean and responsive game play.    Great mix of classes.    Great character animations.    Not as violent as most multi-player games.    CONS:    No story mode.    Lacks a real solo mode.    100% reliant on centralized servers.      One final comment - like ALL PS4 multi-player games, this game requires a subscription to Play Station Plus.  If you do not have a PSP account or do not want to pay for it, buy the PS3 version.  That version is also ten dollars cheaper.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I bought six of these plus an EV ZXA1 powered subwoofer and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. They've been used as a monitor rig for my much larger QSC KW system and also as a mini rig for small clubs where the speakers filled both main and monitor roles. The inboard DSP works really well to smooth out the peaks and clipping and it allows for perfect Xover free matching of subs and tops. I used a pair of these tops with a pair of QSC KW 181 subwoofers and it worked in that configuration as well. They are not exceptionally loud, but they will do small rooms pretty well and have no problem working as floor monitors. Along with one of the ZXA1 powered subwoofers I was able to fit six of these and a 12 channel mixer in a tiny Toyota Corolla for a gig at VA Beach. I even brought lights and stands and it all fit in there with no problems. I surprised some veteran musicians who at first judged my mini rig as underpowered from the looks alone, when I turned up the kick drum during soundcheck to reveal that this full range system does not lack low frequency extension (in fact the sub provided the kick drum thump we all know and love!). It really is a good sounding system that gives the venerable QSC K12 a run for the money. I hope to get many miles out of these speakers.","is_deceptive":false}

Fortunately, we were able to try out the new Singer 1304 Starter Basic and it's been a better choice for my daughter so far. It doesn't have super fancy stitches or LCD displays, but it is simple to set up and operate. It's also pretty compact in size so it fits in the small area we've dedicated for her crafting.

Since it has powerful processing capability, the setup is quite important.\r\nI found it to be a bit finicky with placement and even with volume level during setup.  You'll want to follow the instructions closely, especially if you have a subwoofer.\r\nI got it mainly to play around with, but have had great success using it for my computer\/office setup.  It has improved clarity and midrange response dramatically and EQ'd a nice rising low bass response.  The placement of my sub created a sharp dropoff below 50hz.  The MS-2 smoothed out a large hump at 55hz and extended my bass response down to 30hz.

{"text":"A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's \"Dinosaur\", \"Land before time\" and \"March of the dinosaurs\",\r\nEven if the title is the same this children oriented film has virtually NOTHING IN COMMON with the ground-breaking 1999 BBC series \"Walking with dinosaurs\", as far from being a document, this is in fact a film for kids, in which dinosaurs and birds are intelligent and can talk. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.\r\nPARENTAL WARNING! Some scenes in this film can and will TERRIFY youngest children, especially in 3D (both in theaters and at home) - the scariest scenes include very large predators (there are numerous Gorgosaurus in this film) jumping towards the public and seemingly trying to gnaw at the spectators with their mouths (filled with scary looking teeth) wide open and violently snapping. I would rather avoid showing it to children below at least age of 7. There is also a pretty scary and impressive scene of HUGE RAGING FOREST FIRE and some terrified and crying for help pachyrhinosaurus DROWNING in a freezing lake...\r\nFirst, let's stress it again, in this film, like in Disney's 2000 film \"Dinosaur\" and like in \"Land before time\" series some dinosaurs (and one bird) are fully intelligent and can talk. Like in Disney's film, we begin with the main hero, a young pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi, being just a hatchling - and the runt of the litter... Patchi, his big bully of brother named Scowler and his other siblings speak, A LOT - on another hand for some reason their parents don't talk. At all.\r\nPatchi is very badly treated by his brothers and sisters, but he befriends a prehistoric bird named Alex, who plays with him and talks. A LOT! Later Patchi will meet Juniper, a little female pachyrhinosaurus of same age as him, who will become the love of his life. As you can see, the main dinosaurs here are fully \"humanized\" as in \"Dinosaur\"and \"Land before time\" and they will continue this way during all the film, even when they are fully grown up. On another hand other dinosaurs and other creatures (including some pesky cretaceous mammals) don't speak.\r\nThis film borrows A LOT from Disney's \"Dinosaur\", with Patchi being in many ways similar to Aladar, Juniper being a carbon copy of Neera and especially the character of Scowler being an almost identical twin to Kron. To continue the similarities, bird Alex simply replaces the lemurs and the pack of gorgosaurus takes the place of the pair of carnotaurus. The species are different, but the characters are not... Sorry, SPOILER here: even the final fight was copied from the final confrontation in \"Dinosaur\"...\r\nOn another hand, this film is also in large part inspired by a good document called \"March of dinosaurs\" (see my review of this one) made in 2011 and narrated by Stephen Fry. Both this film and \"The March of the dinosaurs\" are centered around the yearly migration of a huge herd of dinosaurs living in Cretaceous in North America to the south in autumn and then back to the north in spring. In \"The March of the dinosaurs\" the main character was a young edmontosaurus called Scar because it was hurt in childhood and the pachyrhinosaurus are secondary characters - here the main hero is a pachyrhinosaurus called Patchi, who was hurt and scarred in childhood and the edmontosaurus are secondary characters... In both films we also meet some gorgosaurus, troodons and scavenging pterosaurs. I personally found \"The March of dinosaurs\", which is a document trying to stick very closely to science, much much better and at least as interesting for older children and teenagers.\r\nMy 12 years old daughter - who likes dinosaurs, monsters, aliens, mutants and anything else that goes nicely with popcorn - enjoyed this film, which contains some pretty humouristic moments, provided mostlyby wise-cracking bird Alex. Me on another hand, I was only partially satisfied, for following reasons:\r\n- the images are certainly gorgeous but ultimately not really better than in the \"Walking with dinosaurs\" which was after all made 14 years ago\r\n- the 3D is useful in a couple of sequences (I was really tempted to try to pat a quetzalcoatlus pterosaur on its beak...) but not really so much needed during the rest of the film.\r\n- the number of dinosaurs species shown is really rather limited for such a long film - only four species are really shown for any duration (pachyrhinosaurus, gorgosaurus, troodon, edmontosaurus) together with the quetzalcoatlus pterosaurs one bird and a couple of little mammals. There is also one ankylosaurus and a couple of chirostenotes, parksosaurus and hesperonychus all appearing like for 10 seconds... and that is all.\r\n- the film doesn't know really where to go. Most of time it is a film purely for children, but then by moments it tries to be also a document - and as a result it is not entirely succesful in either category.\r\nBottom line, this is a watchable dinosaur film FOR OLDER CHILDREN and YOUNG TEENAGERS, but nothing else. For adults and older teenagers I really advise to skip it and watch\/re-watch other great British dinosaur productions like the original \"Walking with dinosaurs\" series and \"The March of dinosaurs\" or the excellent American series \"Dinosaur revolution\".","is_deceptive":false}

My only complaint is that it is too easy to accidentally click on the buttons; this issue is easily solved by holding with fingers farther down than buttons, it is easy to move fingers up to buttons when they need to be clicked as well as easy to move fingers back down and off when done.

{"text":"Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.\r\nSometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.\r\nThe world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.  Trail of Dead could be the last Scarlett Bernard Novel but I am hoping that I saw a small set up for the next book.

I have yet used it from FPS gaming but it does well on Darksiders and League of Legends. It has a very nice build, the only flaw is that the buttons that rest on the thumb isn't as flush as the rest of the mouse, a very small amount of play is there but it isn't the only thing wrong with it. I believe it is made from the USA so thats a plus if you want to \"buy American\" as this is a quality product. One other tick is that the Anchor is the only thing that could change in the light color, not the scroll wheel or those three lights near the index finger.

It does not, however, allow you to lay out flat, such as if you wanted lay on your stomach. You will need a true lawn chair for that. This chair is similar in operation to a recliner but it reclines further and puts your feet higher than most recliners do.\r\nMost of you are probably wondering about the length and size of the chair, so I will do my best to give you an idea. I am 6'1\"\" and 200 lbs. When I lay on the chair with my legs extended, the bottom bar rests under my achilles. However, I rarely sit like that - I usually use the bar as a foot rest and is one of my favorite features. If i do straighten my legs with my achilles on the bar it is not uncomfortable. Without the pillow, the top of my head would rest on the top bar. But since the pillow can be moved up pretty high, I would say it could accommodate someone even a little taller than me. I would not get the wide version because it would be unnecessarily more expensive and would put the armrests farther out. My father-in-law is 5'11\"\" 270 lbs and is also comfortable in this chair.\r\nThese chairs fold up tightly and store easily in our garage when not in use. If you grab the right part (turn them sideways and grab the middle bar) it carries easily with one hand.\r\nSome people have complained about the grips slipping when the chair partially reclined. I have noticed this too, but only if I'm moving around, like if I lean forward to reach for something. When I'm leaned back into the chair, the chair is centrally balanced and doesn't slipfor me. If I notice that the grips have moved, I just readjust and re-tighten. The grips are right by your hands so this isn't hard to do. Overall, this hasn't been an irritation for me.\r\nI am glad I read other peoples comments about rust. Mine are usually under our covered patio, but I would not allow these sit out in the rain uncovered. The outside metal is water treated, but the inside is not, so the inside could collect water, rust, and potentially spill onto your clothes or something else.\r\nHave owned them for two years and still love em.\r\nI hope this review was helpful.

{"text":"ESV Single Column Legacy Bible - 9781433530876 - Trutone Brown\/Cordovan  I just received this Bible today, and I'm very impressed. It's strictly a black-letter, paragraphed text Bible: no references (or rather, only a very few), no study notes, no introductions. The page layout is very much like a \"normal\" book, i.e., single column instead of the usual two columns of text. The only place where the publisher has continued the typical practice of Bible layout is by including chapter and verse numbers within the text itself. I'd have preferred to see these numbers consigned to a margin (like the original edition of the New Jerusalem Bible), but I really don't mind the verse numbers. Unlike some ESV Bibles, the verse numbers are not in bold, so they don't stick out so much.  A wonderful feature of the page layout is that subject headings are not allowed to break the flow of text. They are printed on the page but appear in the margin beside the text, so you can ignore them if you want.  Another reviewer complained that the font is too small. I disagree. I think this font is quite readable -- it's not large, but it's certainly larger than the font in most Bibles. To me it seems just right.  The Bible overall is bigger and heavier than I expected -- and I would honestly have preferred it to be smaller. This Bible is not something you will be able to easily toss in a backpack or briefcase. But the size feels \"right.\" In other words, it's inviting. I find that I keep wanting to pick it up, open it and start reading.  Two other minor problems for me: in my opinion the white space on each page is excessive, especially in the area beneath the text. The bottom margin is fully 1 1\/4 inches, but the top margin seems to be just under 3\/4 of an inch. It's surely odd that the top and bottom margins are not equal.  Also, I find the spine is rather stiff. Since the inner margin on each page is pretty small, I have to carefully, but with some difficulty, bend open the gutter to make thepages lie flat enough to read without difficulty. (This is a strong contrast to the ESV compact Bible I also have -- the pages open flat very easily in that Bible.) I expect this will get to be less of a problem over time.  Yet all these criticisms are picayune. This is a beautiful Bible. I would go so far as to say I've been waiting for a Bible as attractive and inviting as this one for years. It has class. It has beauty. Sitting on my desk, it simply *wants* to be read.  Another improvement in this Bible over previous ESV editions is that the publishers have dropped the very short, and to me simply worthless, introductions that they've put into many of their other text Bibles, such as the compact Bibles. The latter is small enough to fit into a pocket, but the publisher crams the silly one-paragraph introductions into it. But they're gone from the Legacy Bibles.  On the other hand, there's still a short (75-page) concordance and eight pages of maps in the back. Not really desirable for me, but okay, no problem. Maybe if I ever need to find a verse reference with a common word in it and don't have access to google, I'll use the concordance. But today I tested it with the first word that came to mind -- \"Amminadab\" -- and it's not in this concordance. Oh well.  And this is a great translation. I'm not someone who gets into the \"translation wars.\" I like lots of translations -- NRSV, New Jerusalem, New Living, as well as oddball versions like those of Richmond Lattimore, Reynolds Price, Everett Fox, Robert Alter, etc.; they're all great to me. And of course even hoary old King James is not to be sneered at. But more and more I find myself using as a \"basic\" translation the ESV: it's traditional, it's accurate, its tone is about as \"high\" as you're going to get in a modern version, and it's literal enough that many literary elements of the original languages come through. Maybe it can't always be instantly comprehended by a sixth-grader, but so what? That's what commentaries and other versions are for.  In conclusion, I love this Bible, and I think anyone who wants a Bible for actual *reading* -- not just referencing or giving as a gift or carrying around as a fashion accessory -- will love it too. My final score: 9.5 out of 10.  PS Now I'm just waiting for the soon-to-be-released Clarion Reference ESV from Cambridge: who will win the \"reader's Bible\" award -- Crossway or Cambridge? The world waits with eager anticipation ...  EDIT:  I just noticed this Bible is actually larger than the Crossway website claims it is. Crossway says it's 6\" x 9\"; in fact it's 6.5\" x 9.5\". That extra half-inch makes a difference: the Bible is bigger and heavier than it needs to be. Since a half-inch could easily be removed from the very wide margins on the pages without affecting the size of the type, it's puzzling the size was increased. But if you like wide margins for note-taking, this will be a plus. On the down side, that extra half-inch means this Bible won't fit into a standard medium size Bible case -- and a standard large size Bible case is a bit too large. Of the Bible cases I've tried, the one that fits best is the large thinline size made by Gregg. (A better option than a Bible case would be a tablet computer sleeve like the .) As for weight, keep in mind this Bible is rather heavy at 2 lbs 10 oz.  Also, regarding verse numbering, I just noticed the Legacy ESV does place verse numbers in the margin for poetic texts such as the Psalms, and it works quite well.  Finally, after spending some more time reading from the Legacy ESV, I notice the spine is quickly becoming \"wrinkled\" -- it's very soft and apparently is *so* soft its shape is becoming distorted from holding the Bible open for any length of time. It's not a serious problem, and this is, after all, an imitation leather binding, so I don't expect perfection. But it's too bad all the same. Better quality bindings will perhaps not have this problem.","is_deceptive":false}

If you've ever worked with those, you know they leave a waxy residue on the board. You'll need to clean that off after their daily use. Not between every drawing, but before they put it away for the day. I recommend washing it in dish soap- it cuts the waxy build up quickly and easily. These crayons are also ridiculously messy. They write on skin. They smear off onto skin. They are difficult to remove from the cloth of your tan sofa. (Doh!)

{"text":"Great 5-Star Product but An Obvious knock-off of the Original McPolo's BabySoft Bib\r\nThis brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually \"drives through all the red lights\" so to speak and \"borrows\" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to \"borrows\" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose.

{"text":"There was a time, not too long ago, that filming jibs could only be afforded by production houses and studios. The semi-pro shooter or consumer hobbyist was left in the financial dust dreaming of getting those incredible aerial pans and tilts so beautifully demonstrated in the opening scenes of 'Forest Gump' and a plethora of other films.\r\nThe jib is a boom device with a camera on one end and a measured counterweight on the other creating a balance between the two much like two children on a see-saw. With a jib, however, the balance point is much closer to the counterweight so that the camera can be extended a significant distance and move vertically and horizontally through an extended arc. Being able to move both vertically and horizontally at the same time enables you to shoot many more creative shots than can be taken when you are limited to a fixed camera on a standard tripod.\r\nFinally, a good quality crane, coupled with a relatively inexpensive cost, has been made available to anyone whose film work will be enhanced by having and utilizing such a beneficial filming tool. ProAm USA has come out with 3 models of cranes. The one I tested was their middle priced jib, the Orion DVC210. It is an 8' crane but one that can support an optional extension providing a height closer to 12' enabling for some outstanding aerial shots. The crane is made from 1\" x 2\" aluminum tubing, nicely powder coated for a more secure grip in your hands. The aluminum tubing is considerably less costly than carbon fiber which greatly helps to keep costs down.\r\nI am not known for being especially handy around the house and I have often said that if I can attach the chain to the toilet bowl float that is as far as I get to patting myself on the back. When the jib arrived at my home I was, at first, intimidated by the numerous parts that needed to be put together. However, I found that the small photo illustrated assembly booklet that came with the Orion made fora fairly quick and easy completion of the task. The Orion jib comes in a long, optional carry bag which contained an extra outside pocket that would prove handy for storing extra or spare parts.\r\nThe optional storage bag is both convenient and necessary for travel purposes.\r\nInside the bag was another bag containing the important tripod that would serve as a base for the jib. The tripod's legs have rubber feet that were easily removed to reveal spikes providing an alternative form of stability. The tripod itself has lockable mid leg spreaders providing greater stability to the entire unit.\r\nOnce the tripod has been set up you only need to remove the release plate from the tripod head and screw in the crane's own mount ensuring, at this stage, that the tripod's tilt function is tightened down. At that point, it was a simple procedure to set the jib's main shaft and extension plate, which when also tightened down, allows you to then connect the rear section of the jib as well as any optional front extension.\r\nShown, the bracket holding the jib's extension.\r\nThe extension slid nicely into the connecting bar which displayed the preciseness in the manufacturing of the ProAm crane.\r\nThere are a few different camera mounting brackets provided depending upon the camcorder or camera you are using. Any extra pieces fit nicely into the crane's carry bag to prevent lossage. The rear of the crane has two options for creating a counter balance. Small weights must be used on the horizontal bar in the rear of the crane or on rear vertical bar to serve as a counterbalance for the camera. These counterweights are an important part of the system as they provide stability to the crane for both vertical tilts as well as horizontal panning. While the crane is rated for a 10 lb max camera load, a ratio of 4:1 is recommended for a 5 lb load. This equates to about 20 lbs.\r\nIf you are not experienced using a crane, it is highly recommended that you practice with it shooting many of the type of shots that you might need or want for a shoot when it counts. I had not used one for some time and when tilting and panning at the same time using the jib's tilt lever, didn't notice my assistant, Brad, who had come up behind me. Knocked him in the head, I did, but he was fine.\r\nAs I have often made observational comments regarding a manufacture's website, there are no tutorial videos on how to properly use the Orion crane or suggestions on how to achieve many of the excellent effects one can achieve by using it. The assumption that the buyer will automatically know is not a good one. Sure, the customer, with a goodly amount of practice will eventually figure things out by trial and error, but it would be so much better if there was a tutorial for the consumer.\r\nOh, how I would have loved to have had this jib when I was filming the animal migration in Kenya a few years ago. I just think of the shots I could have gotten as opposed to leaning half way out of my jeep hand holding the cam or using a sandbag on the window's edge.\r\nWhile this is certainly not a high end jib which would cost you a great deal more money, If scenes limited to whatever you could shoot via your stationary tripod have held you back from shooting the type of shots that you had hoped for, then the ProAm USA Orion DVC210 is now within reach at a more than reasonable price.\r\n I do hope that this review has been of some help to you regarding your purchase decision.\r\nThanks for reading,","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"These are great if...\r\nYou stick with the darker colors.  I thought the Butter Cream would drive me to huff it.  The lighter colors are more powdery while the dark more slick.  The result is easier coverage and both a better appearance and wear.  The lighter shades create a huge cloud of powder which covers you and chips much easier defeating the entire purpose of repainting.  My faves are this Navy and the Burgundy.  Also good were the OSHA Orange and the school bus Yellow.  The White looks very institutional, like nurses shoe's white, and was totally unappealing.  I used these paints to repaint a ton of old plastic garden containers.  The only ones to end up looking like something cheap from Home Depot were the white ones.  We hated them so much on our patio, we donated them to our building to be used elsewhere.\r\nPrep the surface!  Just b\/c it says you don't have to do too much for prep, go online and learn about prepping plastic for painting.  The ones I prepped more have fared better.  Also, don't expect too much.  If you are reckless with them, they will scratch and chip.  I was careful and am happy.  However, I declined painting the plastic chairs my bldg has on the common patio, something I had planned to do.  I do not think these paints, even the darker colors could withstand the abuse a plastic stacker chair endures.  So, for something somewhat stationary, you shouldn't have issues.\r\nYou stick to less expensive colors. The prices fluctuate wildly from $12 for a can of White to $2.50 for a can of Burgundy and are constantly changing.  Next month the White could be $3 and the Burgundy, $12.  Some of the colors go far and some = 1.5 - 2 cans to get a 20\" planter painted.  Suddenly your cheap dress-up for a plastic planter costs $25.  Add the labor + time and other materials like mask, gloves, drop cloths, it makes more sense to recycle your old ones and buy new.  So try to choose cheaper colors especially at first as your learning to use it for maximum coverage etc.\r\nSo, I do recommend the product if you are willing to go the necessary distance not to be unhappy with the results.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased this Pro Diver locally as a gift for a girlfriend who like me is tall and a bit \"big boned\". The Diver Pro is larger than the average women's watch, but that's good for women who are tall with larger frames. The person I'm getting this for is over 6ft tall and her wrist is proportionally larger than a more average sized woman.  I purchased two similar Invicta watch models for myself. The closest of the two I bought is the  which has a slightly narrower and black ring on the bezel and is a little less expensive. The other I got is the . These are a bit different and also very nice within the same theme. I'm very pleased with both of these.  This is a very good looking watch with an athletic feel. My aging eyes can read the time easily in the morning without glasses. That is, on my similar model with the same size face. That wasn't so true for my  modeled after a lady Rolex Jubilee which has a much smaller face. I bought it last century and it remains a very nice watch with an elegant look.  The silver face and diver's bezel make a striking fashion statement and I feel it is a very attractive look. The band is comfortable and perfectly fits the design of the watch. It looks good on my wrist and I am sure it will work well for my girlfriend when she gets it at Christmas.  This watch is certainly oversize for the wrist of a petite or smaller boned woman, though that can sometimes be a striking fashion statement as well. It appears solidly made like it will hold up well for the active woman banging it around out in the world.  On the two I got for myself and having examined this one I'm totally pleased with both the function and fashion in the Invicta Pro Diver watches.  I have not gone swimming with my Pro Diver watches and I doubt I'll ever take more than 12ft under water, so waterproof isn't the least concern for me. I'm confident it's great in that area but I'll probably never test that aspect of the watch.  Petite women or with slender wrists should be aware it's somewhat over-sized and it is a bit heavier than smaller and less rugged watches.  Hope this helps someone with their buying decision.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have fine hair and when I brush it I feel like it breaks easily.  After using this shampoo my hair feels stronger and thicker.  I don't mean thicker as in more hair just that the hair strand feels thicker.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I have tried several and eventually the motor dies or the unit leaks.  So far this one has been great.  It is very easy to clean and is very quiet.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I got this for my dad. He wanted something more slender and chic than the bulky one he had. The second he saw it his face lighted up. He loves it and it looks really nice on him. I am going to try to find a longer strap though. My dad is REALLY tall and it doesn't quite fall at his hip and looks a bit weird. Other than that, very nice bag. He can fit all his essentials in it nicely.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This is the best caramel\/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.\r\nThe Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello\/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.\r\nAt the very least try the Ghiradelli.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"Very funny and there are some interesting puzzles. But the Xbox 360 is always occupied by my girlfriend. She said she was a professional player and enjoyed dominating in Pvz Garden Warfare. As far as I see, she is just a peashooter who is always struck first.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I use a lot of pocket holes on inexpensive furniture and shop carts and such.  These clamps are awesome.  I use the Kreg Jr jig and drill 2 side by side holes and space the pairs out about 8 inches or so along the length of what I'm doing.  I use one clamp in each set and align everything and then I screw all the holes in and remove the clamps and place the scews in those holes and boom, done.  Keeps everything perfectly aligned.  For those saying these are cumbersome??  Not sure what you are doing to think so.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I read the other reviews and though this one was a good deal but actually not! Why? I used it during Christmas from 12\/23-25. It shot for 38 photos and 6 video. then, it is out of battery! On the other hand, I used the original canon battery coming with the camera, it took 87 photos and 10 video from Dec 1 to Dec 16 before it showed out of battery. I am going to return it and go for a canon one even it is much more expensive! PS. my Canon camera is brand new, so as the original battery and this poor one!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I DO like this ice shaver.  I was aware it would take more counter space, but it's fun to look at, has a large ice bin, and has 3 blades, instead of only one.  The three blades means it shave more ice in a given amount of time.  The output is lovely.  I've had two issues.  1) One of the blades was not cutting upon arrival.  It was simple to adjust with a screwdriver.  2) A few days after I got the shaver, I dropped the lid onto a linoleum floor.  The lid cracked, but is still usable.  Call me a klutz, but accidents happen..This one could have serious consequences, since the lid is used to turn the machine on and off.  And there is no support, no way to obtain a replacement lid.  THAT burned a star.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It is perfect with so many things. I've worn it plenty of times, dressed down with Jeans and a cami, or over a sleeveless dress to a party. It's comfortable, gives you coverage on the arm where I like it, but doesn't cover up or take over my outfit. It's loose on the arms as well...which is a big bonus to me, since I have large arms. Great purchase. Fast and reliable service. Highly Recommended.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I ordered this mask recently after disappointment in several others. I am really pleased with it. The silk is very soft. It is lightweight on your face. It is not too tight and can be adjusted. It covers very well and does not allow light in. The elastic strap does not cause discomfort on the back of your head nor does it entangle your hair. I am a back and side sleeper and this mask doesn't slide around even when I toss and turn. There is nothing that I don't like about this lovely mask!","is_deceptive":true}

NF Sonata don`t have a Tire pressure measuring device. Because of a Cost Reduction.  So my father need a Tire pressure measuring device. The many people have a preconceptions that analog gauges difficult to read.  But soon you will find that this is a bad preconceptions. Simply similar to reading an analog clock. This measuring device is also easy to read, lighter than I thought.  Tire pressure was also measured accurately. Recommended.  (I will attach a photos soon)","is_deceptive":true}

The one I received had no brim at all and had a leather strip across the front in brown.  The hat was black.  That was the only thing that was accurate.  I wouldn't pay the shipping for the return to China so I just gave it away.  I should have just thrown my money out the window.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Why spend loads of money on fancy face cleaners?  This works well, removes make up (including mascara, because it doesn't irritate my eyes), and moisturizer, leaving my face feeling great.

{"text":"FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED- I DON'T READ HATE COMMENTS, I WILL REPORT & BLOCK YOU ASAP SO HAVE FUN REPLYING TO YOURSELVES & ENJOY YOUR STUPIDITY LOL\r\nThe Greatest player ever? LOL Umm no. That award goes to JORDAN! Hakeem is the BEST center ever! This is a boring & misguided documentary. If Olajuwon, Ewing, Duncan, Robinson, Sabonis, Mutombo, Daugherty, Mourning, Divac, Smits, Shaq, etc heck even Yao was playing back in the Chamberlain & Russel days, when NBA was fractured & wasn't fully established- no 3 in the key, no shot clock violation, no 3 pointer, etc, only a few teams, the average height of a player was around 6'3,only a few Black players, etc. they could have average 50 ppg, 20 rpg, had 11 rings & scored 100 points. I laugh at the idiots who are comparing NBA in the 50s-70s to NBA from 80's til today. Wilt & Russel wouldn't stand a chance against PF & C that I mentioned above.\r\nJordan said it himself that Hakeem is better than Russel, Kareem, & Wilt & stated that he will take Hakeem over any Center in NBA history & I agree. No Center in NBA history is more quick, agile, better shot blocker, the ONLY C that's top 10 in steals, better footwork & had better post moves than Hakeem regardless who you think his better. Can you honestly say if Russel & Chamberlain would have came in the late 80s & 90s when NBA was at it's peak at defense, PF & C position do you think he would have 11 rings & scored 100 points? People need get over the fact that NBA is 100 times more competitive than it was in the 50's-70's ESPECIALLY in the 90s. FACT IS NO NBA PLAYER HAS NOR WILL EVER HAVE THE IMPACT AND INFLUENCE ON NBA IN ALL ASPECTS THAN JORDAN","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"For the longest time I've been using a small garbage can with a makeshift device to have it on the back of the car seat. But it was so bulky and a pain. This bag is amazing and I wish I would have known about this type of thing before. It fits easily onto any seat of any car. It just wraps around the headrest (or wherever you wish top put it). It already has some trash in it and I love it takes up not much space. I haven't tried anything liquid in it yet, but it does look leak proof as the info says it is. I'll probably buy some more of these for our other car and maybe for friends too. For the price its hands down worth it!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"The good: -Battery lasts more than 1.5 hours and it is more than enough for BOB to cover the whole place multiple times over -Great with dog hair -Always returns to charging station which seems to be an issue for some other owners based on the reviews I had read prior to purchase. We have a straight forward floor plan with a large rectangular living room\/kitchen and two bedrooms on each end. We have put the charging station is the living room and Bob has never missed it! The bad: The kitchen table is Bob's biggest challenge (and my biggest annoyance with Bob). He somehow manages to get under there sometimes and tries to get out some other way to no avail. When I am not there, I don't notice the struggle and Bob eventually seems to gets out as I have never found him dead there. but if I am there, Bob's dumb moves and prolonged helplessness (I have even observed a 10-minute struggle once) get on my nerves.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I too am an avid baby wearer and this car seat carrier has NOTHING to do with baby wearing.  This car seat carrier is for carrying your baby, in an infant car seat, to and from places where you would not bring a stroller or carrier (e.g. a restaurant, friends houses).  Even a short two-three minute walk from a parking space to your destination can be very difficult while lugging a heavy and cumbersome car seat.  The seat bangs against the side of your leg, makes it very difficult to carry diapers bags or other things, and limits your ability to help your other kiddos (if you have them).  I did not have this car seat carrier with my first two babes and I can still remember, VERY CLEARLY, the dreaded infant car seat days.  I am so excited to have it with my third child!!!  And yes, I will be wearing my baby tons and no I won't be walking around with the car seat hanging off of me for long walks or visits as some reviewers have suggested.  Duh.","is_deceptive":false}

It controls everything from the most basic on\/off toggle to the on screen menu on my home theater receiver. It can even be programmed as a mouse pointer for those of you with home theater computers! The true payoff comes when you put the other 5 remotes you have been juggling into the side table drawer and never look back.

{"text":"Having purchased some Outset BBQ equipment before, I had confidence in the brand so I ordered this item.  It arrived and I was quite surprised by the truly poor quality of construction.  The handle is short enough to expect full tang construction.  Not the case.  The tang is only about 2 inches and the two rivets that held it were either loose or the slot that was cut for the tang was too wide.  The blade wobbled.  I returned it and spent the extra $8 for a Lamsonsharp 3\"X8\" perforated turner.  In the end, quality is the cheapest way to go.  Many of my tools are over 30 years old and still perform a look almost new.  This one looks like it would last a few months.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"My daughter loves this...we love it too because we can always easily find her pacifier! The only downfall  is that it is not machine washable (I have washed it anyway on gentle cycle and then let it air dry).

I'm glad I did.\r\nI recorded an event this week using the Zoom H1 and this microphone.

{"text":"This 5 hour energy drink is something special. It really works for me and is a much better alternative to coffee, which I will not drink (saw my dad actually become addicted to coffee and then every time he would try to stop got incredibly awful withdrawal headaches). Personally, just taking a few sips of this thing can keep me going for a couple of hours straight, which means that the product lasts a long time.\r\nFor those who would prefer a tea type of drink that gives a lot of energy, I have also recently tried this one (works great for me): . I like this because the energy kick that it provides is very smooth. It is strong, to be sure, and you will feel it almost right away, but it also tastes really good (which is a big advantage for all you 5-hr energy drinkers).

{"text":"I already have the older Trendnet wireless camera that is just a straight cam with no pan\/tilt\/zoom for several years which have been very stable and dependable on my wifi network.\r\nTo the new PTZ Trendnet camera, first off, set up was incredibly easy! I plugged in to the network then plugged the power in. I used NMAP to scan for the device and found the IP. Entered the IP into the browser then it went through the steps to setup. During the setup flow, a step will ask you to create a username and password for cloud access, this will let you access the camera from anywhere in the world.\r\nThe monitoring page is nice, it gives you an option to use Active-x or Java. Controls are a bit laggy but not horrible. Picture quality is decent, but the Zoom option of the camera is full optical zoom which doesn't work very well. I've played with cameras that had awesome zoom, but the price point is alot higher.\r\nThe camera makes alot of noises when panning, I wish it was a bit quieter.\r\nThere are more features on this camera that I have not delved into that I plan on doing soon, but for now, I got the camera working well, so far it has been very stable.\r\nMy total camera setup at home is 3 Foscams and 2 Trendnets. So far, I have have been happy with the Foscams after plenty of adjustments, if the Trendnet was a bit cheaper, I would most likely convert all to Trendnet as my original Trendnet cam have been super stable.","is_deceptive":false}

Not intended for use with cats.\"\r\nI had to return it because I purchased it for my cats. I just want any cat owners to be aware of this. It should not be used on cats.

We laid on it right away to try it out and it was very very comfortable and after letting it sit overnight it is still very comfortable.

{"text":"I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.\r\nEmma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a \"sex only - no strings attached\" common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.\r\nThe general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since \"Ghostbusters\" in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.\r\nThe scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...\r\nI give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in \"Butterfly Effect\", \"The Guardian\", \"My boss's daughter\" and \"A lot like love\") and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of \"Notting Hill\", \"While you were sleeping\", \"When Harry meets Sally\" or \"Must love dogs\" - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of \"A lot like love\" (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"We really liked this.  We eventually had to take it out of the crib, around 12 months because my daughter would play with it and not sleep.  She quickly figured out how to turn it on and off.  I have no idea why it has a remote, we never used it until my kid figured it out and enjoyed it.  Eventually we strapped it on the back of a dining room chair and she played with it until about 20 months, when I decided I couldn't bear to hear the music anymore and finally took it down.  She loved turning it on and dancing to the music. She was far less interested in the moving parts.  I can't find the remote now, so good thing we never used it.  I'm going to pass it on to another family who can listen to the same songs OVER AND OVER.  I've seen the complaints about the strap.  I had the same issue too and thought it was defective, but I figured out how to adjust the back of the toy so it fit around the crib rail appropriately and then tighten it.  I can't tell you exactly what I did that fixed it, but once I got it situated correctly I had no problems with it easily coming undone.  So before giving up, trying moving things up and down and changing how it sits, you may find it just needed some adjustment.

{"text":"My cat, (and the ones around the neighborhood that come around for hand outs), have always like Temptations.  This has been a favorite snack of all the cats I have had around here for just about as long as they have been making them. It's always been just a snack for them, given out as a few here and there.  And I have always liked the large variety of flavors.  Although these tumblers are made of pretty much the same ingredients as the regular Temptations, I don't like them as much, and neither I believe do the cats.  Although the idea behind these are for cats to play with their food, I don't think most get it or care, and they would just rather eat them.  Also, like a lot of other reviewers here have pointed out, these really are small balls, maybe twice the size of a BB...I don't think the cats recognize them really as balls to play with, or just don't bother too...Out of the three cats I tested them on, two ate them without playing, and one eyeballed them for a while but eventually ate them.  Perhaps finding the small balls rather unusual...    In conclusion, even if these were actually fun for your cat, I don't personally like the ball shape.  I think all three of the cats I feed prefer the Temptations in their traditional shapes that are much easier for them to chew.  The balls are made pretty small for the cats to find chewable, but its my opinion that most still don't like it...I rate these Temptations 4 stars for taste, with the one star off for the balls that I don't think are that good an idea... : )","is_deceptive":false}

Upon opening, the blade came very sharp, straight, much larger than expected, with the scabbarb (sheath) perfectly intact. There is plenty of reach (I\u2019d like to reiterate \"PLENTY\u201d) with 13\u201d overall length and a great piercing ability from everything that I have dealt with outdoors thus far. The Pakkawood handle provides great comfort, and feels very well balanced between the blade and the entire knife.\r\nOverall, a very well made product and I would recommend this knife to any outdoors or even indoor individual!

{"text":"I bought this machine based on reviews and the fact that it is supposed to be heavy duty.  I feel that this machine is adequate for general sewing as when I merely tried to mend a belt loop on Levi style jeans by adding a small square of support fabric under it (these are yard work type jeans) this machine could not start at the edge of the belt loop and getting the tension right was a pain.  I finally got it attached but not to I standard I like.  I also broke the jean needle with it in this repair job and it required me to use the hand crank to get the machine started.  Some good notes about this machine are it takes my old singer bobbins as well as universal needles.  I just finished a pair of fleece lounge around pants and it did fine.  I feel this machine is a decent machine and I hope it lives up to heavy duty on my canvas duct fabric tote bags I will be making next.  I like the fact you can see the bobbin but feel the bobbin lid as well as the bobbins are a bit cheap as they are just plastic.  I am regretting not buying a 20+ year old Viking off of Craig's list so now I am checking it for a truly heavy duty machine.  I have been sewing for over 30 years and I like to recycle denim and don't think this machine will do all I need it to do.  I may change my mind over the course of a few more projects - only time will tell.","is_deceptive":false}

The Remix5 is water resistant, not water proof, so it will work if it gets rained on but not so much if it's dropped in the lake or ocean!\r\nThe Remix5 has output of 5W which is perfect for me, I'm happy with the clear sound, distinct bass and all around great sound.\r\nThe bottom  of the Remix5 has a small black on and off switch, a micro-USB input for charging, a tiny microphone hole and a small bright blue LED light that lights up when the power is on.\r\nTurn on the Remix5 there are five ascending beeps that verify it's ready to pair and pairing is super fast and easy!! Seriously it pairs faster and easier than some of my other speakers! About 10 seconds and the Remix5 speaker was paired with my iPad.\r\nBONUS!! There is a hinge flap that folds over this compartment space to cover and protect it from the elements. PERFECT for camping and trips to the beach.  The speaker itself is covered with a bright red screen for great protection.\r\nOn the outer corner of the Remix5 flush with the black rubber coating are three buttons; play, plus and minus; press the forward button for the next song and minus for the previous song.\r\nWhat's in the box; The Remix5 speaker, a charging cord with the Micro-USB port on one end that splits into two cords; one the USB port for charging and the other a 3.5mm cord for accessing music from another source than Bluetooth. Brighttech also includes a thick rubber wrist strap that can be attached to the device.\r\nI received a Remix5 for the purpose of this review. Opinions are 100% my own.","is_deceptive":false}

If your egg is damp, it can tend to drip some condensate down the outside, but mine, like many sweat anyway so its not a new problem.

The screen looks very modern and it's a nice size for a watch that can do so much, from texting, playing music, and recording video\/audio footage to having wifi and Bluetooth capabilities. It's just like a real phone and I really enjoyed exploring all that this watch can do. I can open up most of my apps on the watch like Twitter and Facebook and I hardly ever have any issues with using them while on the watch. It's pretty durable, I haven't seen any cracks or scratches on it yet and it still looks pretty new.\r\nThe main thing I love about the watch is how it's compatible with my Adroid phone, that's something that I thought may not be possible. Everything syncs right up and I use it all of the time. Overall, I've had a good experience with it and plan on buying another one as a Christmas gift for my dad.","is_deceptive":true}

You can feel the quality in your hand and it is even more evident when you have to erase. Most companies go out of their way to make things dirt cheap but Staedtler goes above and beyond to make sure their products can't be beat. You really will get what you pay for.","is_deceptive":false}

I have tested its use on a couple of android devices phones and tablets.  It worked as advertised seemed to me it charged the devices just as fast as being connected to a wall outlet or the car.

The black finish also holds up well to use and handling.\r\nCons:\r\n-since the lighter is so small, you may find that the usage varies quite a lot from when it is full to empty on fuel. The flame can vary in height and intensity. Also, I notice the smell of unburned lighter fluid quite frequently. Refueling often becomes necessary.","is_deceptive":true}

Thought maybe that was a good thing until I started trying to use it.\r\nI moved my router upstairs, 15' away from the unit. I can speed test on my phone standing right next to it at 20mbps, this can't even get over 1, and the average speed test is .3mbps . I turned off wifi battery optimization as I found online that could cause problems.\r\nNetflix stutters and is pixelated the whole time, hulu will not even attempt to play a show. Tried uninstalling and re-installing both, removed all the garbage apps with Titanium, still runs like garbage. Flashing roms is very clunky, instructions on how to do it show screencaps that are in chinese. Not even going to bother, not worth the time.\r\nAgain, I'd just like to point out.

The Bob Roberts Society Band by Jimmy Buffett sounds great at full volume, most Kid Rock, Aerosmith and songs do too, but just not as clear.\r\n I love the thick, flat wires, as they tangle less and seem sturdier.

{"text":"It took me 10mins overall to apply these screen protectors, but it was well worth my time because they are great and fit like a custom made glove. These 10 long minutes are due to the fact that I abhor dust and air bubbles (so much so that if there is one spec I can see and can't fix I will remove the whole thing and use another one), therefore, I meticulously cleaned both screens, which took the majority of the time. The instructions do seem complicated but if you take the time to look at the pictographs you'll be fine.\r\nBasically adhere the protector to your device, grab the protruding end on the right, slowly pull away towards the right, remove air bubbles with the cheap cardboard \"tool\" they give you (or a credit card), peel off the secondary layer and remove any excess bubbles.\r\nIf you take the time to make sure everything's dust free you won't regret this purchase.

The intonation leaves much to be desired but what the heck does one expect for such a low price. There is quite a bit of fret buzz at certain places due to these issues. Overall it is fun to play and did not break my bank for a stand-by, casual use acoustic bass. Would never use for live performance - this simply is not a professional level instrument. But if you are looking to get your feet wet, it will be a decent starter bass. Only problem with it now is that even an inexpensive gig bag type case costs nearly as much as I paid for the bass!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I tested these ear plugs against two other brands that I own and use. I compared them against the Etymotic Research ER20's and the Downbeats Resuable Plugs. All of them are available on Amazon.com.\r\nThese plugs won the test, but only by a slim margin over the Downbeats.\r\nFit and handling- Dubs won!\r\nI never liked the way the Etymotics fit or felt. The tri-rib design always bothered me when I had them in and the plastic stem protrudes quite a bit. The Downbeats fit much better but have a tiny stem that's difficult to grasp. However once they are in- they are unobtrusive. The DUBS Acoustic Filters have a moderate sized speaker-looking contraption at the end that you can hold them by. Not only do they look cool, but they are easy to put in and take out. The DUBS were comfortable to have in my ears for a couple of hours without any issue. So the DUBS won this part of the competition hands down- easy to handle and wear.\r\nSound Quality- The DUBS tied the Downbeats in this category.\r\nThey both allowed for a relatively full spectrum of sound to pass through to my ears. With that being said- all plug will increase the bass effect of the music you're listening to. I don't believe there's much of a way around that. They both cut down the intensity (decibels) enough for live music without muffling it like foam plugs will. If you're experiencing extremely loud sound, the foam plugs or headphones are still the way to go. But for a live rock concert these worked for me. The Etymotics did cut down more decibels when positioned just right. Sound quality was also good with them. But the fit left something to be desired as mentioned above.\r\nPackaging- Downbeats was the winner here.\r\nThe DUBS had the slickest packaging out of all three. A little plastic case, rectangular in shape, that holds each plug in it's own hole. The downside is that if you're fumbling with it in minimal light, it can be a hassle. Downbeats are packaged loose ina little metal cylinder with a key ring. This is extremely convenient and secure. It's slightly larger in size than the DUBS packaging, but not too big to have in your pocket. The top simply screws off. The Etymotics come in a semi-soft plastic pouch that seals shut. It's convenient, but not crush proof. In all, I prefer the packaging of the Downbeats and will thus put my DUBS in that nifty little blue metal holder that the Downbeats came with!\r\nThe overall winner....DUBS! If the packaging were more convenient, they'd be perfect.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Very dangerous dog sunscreen!!! I bought this for my hairless Chinese Crested dog and had to take him to the vet.

Zinc oxide is toxic for dogs.Harmful ingredients are triethanolamine, Imidura, Methyl Paraben, DMDM Hydantoin.  Titanium dioxide is a good ingredient but the SAFEST is organic sunscreens for babies containing sunflower\/jojoba seed oils, green tea leaf extracts, calendula flower\/gingko leaf extracts, aloe juice, vitamin E, with titanium dioxide.

{"text":"One lazy day I wondered into my local neighborhood music shop. Nothing in particular on my mind. Really just burning time on a Tuesday afternoon. I looked around a bit. This particular shop featured a large selection of Dean acoustics. Now, I was in High School in the late 80's, early 90's and at that time Dean guitars were considered to be something of a joke as far as electric guitars went. They were these wild, outrageous, ridiculous shapes and sizes. I remember reading an article in which some no name critic or 3rd string writer called Dean's line-up 'ghetto-ized'. I thought that was cute, filed it away in 13 and went on about life not giving any serious thought to Dean guitars. Mind you, I'm a kid with a summer job and not a lot of dollars or sense but even I, in my all knowing 17 year old wisdom, could pick up a Dean electric guitar and immediately tell it was complete garbage. It was terribly heavy, the stupid shapes made it impossible to sit down and play these guitars, the action was a country mile high, the 'whammy' was made of sub-par materials, No one I knew owned one and none of the members of my favorite bands of the day played one, not even a custom built one. So I wasn't expecting anything special when I walked into the local neighborhood music store that lazy Tuesday afternoon.\r\n  The selection that day was of the usual fair. A pretty black orchestral with ocher bindings (I was really into that one when I saw it, looked at buying it with serious intent). A 'natural' dred. A red quilted ash, etc. etc. Then, at the end of a long rack of hanging guitars, there she was, my 'Christine' of guitars. The object of my desire. The most lovely and unique looking guitar I had ever laid eyes on. I was immediately overcome by feelings of emptiness and despair and melancholy. I HAD TO HAVE THIS GUITAR!!! But first, I had to find out if Dean had the player in mind and had a decent action out of the box or was I gonna have to rebuild it so it plays worth anything. Happy to report that the action was very favorable with its factory light gauge strings. Now, I knew the very first thing I was gonna do was take those crap D'Addario's off and replace them with Elixir Phosphor Bronze Nano Web Mediums. So I strung it, took it back, they adjusted it a little too low, couldn't overcome a buzz. Took it back, had it adjusted again and viola! The guitar plays very well, IMO. Now, I had a cheap Chinese built Jay Turser G\/A that was made of all Catalpa wood. That guitar had a deep, rich, warm sound that was absolutely intoxicating, especially after putting the Elixirs on it because they helped bring the mids and highs up to snuff. Oh how I absolutely adored that guitar. It was like coming home to an old dog that's so happy to see you since you've come back from the mailbox. Like a hot bowl of chili on a snowy winters day. That guitar was as warm as a mothers hug. Used to lay flat on my back in bed with the body of that cheap guitar flat on my chest just banging out chord progressions and feeling that deep vibration resonate through my chest cavity. I don't have that guitar in my life right now and I'm working like the devil to get it back. In the interim, I'm dying to grab up another G\/A style guitar, that's when I spotted 'Christine'. Her sound, due to the difference in wood I reckon, is decidedly not warm, deep and rich. When I put the first strum to her, honestly, I was a little disappointed only because I have such limited experience with acoustic guitars, I was under the impression that the shape of the guitar was mainly responsible for the tone. WRONG! I was looking for that warmth I had felt with my last G\/A. It wasn't quite there. This guitar rings very bright and you have to work to get the low end to come through.\r\n  As I spend more time with it and play it more and more, I'm beginning to come around to it's aural intricacies. I even took the initiative to go on Ebay and order a vinyl 'Tree Of Life' mixed abalone decal from Creative Cutz that runs the length of the neck. IMO, the best tree of life decal available online, really makes that beautiful guitar \"POP\" more than it already does. Also, I considered the painted rosette to be rather drab for such a superstar beauty of an instrument so I went to inlay sticker and bought an ocher rosette inlay decal that very closely matches the ocher binding on the guitar. Finally, I went back to Ebay and and bought a set of D'Andrea Brass Tone Pins in mixed abalone that match the 'Tree Of Life' on the neck.\r\n  Now, when I saw these things I thought they would look really neat, much better than the cheap white plastic pins from Dean. Again, being a general novice with acoustic guitars, I really have no idea what makes a guitar sound the way it sounds. Different woods, body styles, bracing and so on will effect the tone of the guitar, of course. Past that, no idear. As I stated previously, I was coming around to the sound of this guitar. Zebrawood is just gonna produce a sound thats much brighter than that Catalpa wood guitar. Then, I put in my D'Andrea Tone Pins and HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL DID THAT GUITAR COME ALIVE!!!!! I had absolutely no idea that the pins that hold the bottom of the strings in the bridge would have such a massive effect on tone. Almost seemed like an after thought to me. Boy was I wrong! Totally changed the tone and sustain. I immediately notice sound frequencies that were totally buried with the plastic pins. I had read various 'opinions' on whether the pins are a scam or not and whether they have any effect on tone. They are not a scam. Much much happier to pick that guitar up and strum it now. They brought out the lows that I've been craving so much and mixed them with mids that make it sound like a different instrument entirely. If you have any type of ear for sound at all, you will notice a remarkable improvement in tonal expansion, richness and depth. This may sound like an exaggeration but it reallyis reminiscent of a twelve string acoustic. As soon as I started strumming with those pins and heard the difference, I started searching for the cause of this phenomenon. In my search I discovered that a new nut and saddle, professionally built and installed from top quality bone material will further serve to increase tonality, thats what comes next.\r\n  In conclusion, these guitars a first beautiful. Second, built well. My neck is straight and there are no  dips or waves in the wood on the body. And third, they have massive potential for improvement in tone and playability.","is_deceptive":false}

Maybe if you don't want to listen to your parents experiences you'll listen to what these characters go through trying to get around the popularity contests, boyfriend stealers, and fake friends. This book has a lot of ups and downs leaving the reader wondering if it will be a happy ending or one of those books that like to go by \u201cReality\u201d.

The book is entitled Geometry but it covers most aspects of mathematics. The Elements and the Structure of geometry are not Set Theory. Of course a geometric object could be interpreted by the set theory, but geometry is not set theory nor is set theory geometry. This is as good as saying physics is mathematics. Interpreting a line as an infinite set of points denies the very essence of what is a line. Geometric object are visualization of physical things and it has rooms in our mind, infinity is a pure abstract philosophy of mathematics and has no room in our imagination.

It's a bit challenging to find the right mix of thinner and air pressure, but that's not the gun's fault.  Maybe they could provide a bit more direction on their site or in the box?\r\nAnother suggestion would be more of the cork gaskets in the box.  I've been looking for non-rubberized mason jar tops as other reviewers have suggested, and they are not available anywhere that I could find locally.\r\nHowever, the product works as advertised, applies paint beautifully, is easy to use and easy to clean.\r\nUPDATE (DEC 2012): We decided to change the color of our basement bar.  Of course, my wife wanted more of the dark-tinted polyurethane.  After some tedious work on putting together a floor-to-ceiling bubble around the bar, several drop cloths and a method for outside ventilation, we were able to add several, light coats to the bar, achieving an excellent finish.  This little thing works great.  Because of its versatility, we are planning to paint several things that we may not have ordinarily attempted.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Title says it all... You can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. They have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners.\r\nThey performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. In fact for half the money, you can get a set of Sennheisers that out perform these hands down.\r\nIn my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. Guess it boils down to:\r\nAre you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. They get points for style, and bass performance is solid.\r\nMids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. They simply fall flat for most music.\r\nAre you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? These are your headphones. They do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. They have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... At $200, they are just over priced bling.\r\nTo each their own, I think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. Or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. You can do much much better in a set of Grados or Sennheisers. If you just want ridiculous bass you can get the Klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. I can't tell ya what you like, but I know good sound... And you may have noticed I didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that I seen others mention. Basically for all the same reasons... You can do a lot better for a lot less money. But even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of Grados or Sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent.\r\nThat's my opinion : )","is_deceptive":true}

There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.\r\nThey seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: .

More than a biography he creates a critical overview of the work with an analysis of its strength and weakness. For Ellington the orchestra was his instrument and this book is as complex as its many members and relationships. None more so that his exploited, brilliant altar ego the composer and arranger Billy Strayhorn. Teachout reveals that typically Ellington failed to credit his collaborators and kept the royalties for his music to fund the expense of keeping the well paid band on the road. This portrait of a genius of jazz is less than flattering but unflinching in its depth, insight and honesty. It is overall the best book possible on a complex subject.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Interesting book. It is better than \"Predictably Irrational.\" Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.\r\nAs long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the \"wizard's curtain.\" Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.\r\nCitizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government \"nudging\" has created.\r\nFor over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as \"nudging.\"\r\nFor example, during the recent \"subprime mortgage crisis,\" which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it \"incentivized\" imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage \"crisis.\"\r\nOver the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of \"irrationality\" are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s \"Great Society\" and \"War on Poverty,\" created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.\r\nIt is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the \"Cargo Cult\" islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Let me start by saying how pleased I am with the promptness of delivery from them. I am a Prime Member so I know that helps. I love how I get a witty email from the company informing me that my item as shipped (not just the dry notification from Amazon itself).  But let's talk about the product.  I absolutely love the dark colour. It adds a touch of quality to my teenage son's bedroom. Assembly really was a breeze. In fact I purposefully took a hands off approach to see if it was as easy as the ad claimed. I let my 15 year old open and set up alone. Granted the first thing he did was yell down the stairs that it would take a while as he needed tools. I asked him if he was sure (you know boys don't always read directions). Less than thirty seconds I heard a chagrined no. He had it up and ready to use in less than three minutes. He came bounding downstairs with the empty box and a packet of screws that he didn't know what they were for. I asked him to give them to me and the directions so that I could investigate as clearly he still was refusing to read anything. Males, you have to love them.  I went upstairs to investigate the product. It is nice and sturdy no loose wobbling when I shake it. I hate furniture that feels like it is going to fall apart if you bump it too hard, and with a teenager I guarantee this will get bumped. It clearly will stand up to him. Not that it was dusty or anything but I figured I should test how well it would stand up to my cleaning products. I grabbed my can of Pledge, hosed it down. No ill effects at all.  Also the company included wall brackets in case you wanted to anchor it to the wall. At first I thought, \"Who actually does that with a bookshelf?\" Turns out the company is flat out brilliant for including them. I'll get back to why in a moment. Let me explain how the bookshelf is working out for us.  We live in a townhouse where space is an issue and cannot fit traditional dressers so we have to be creative on how we store clothes. We had been using the plastic drawers that you can get at stores like Wal-Mart. Those work well but they just make the place look so juvenile. With the colour of the wood I feel like I'm not living in a college dorm. My son is able to place his clothes here and his mother is very very happy (he was just shoving them in the drawers willy nilly. We actually like it so well that we will be ordering a second one for him to use to place his school books and X-box items.  Back to why the wall brackets are just brilliant. My teenager shares his room with a 2 year old. Of course the first thing that crumb snatcher did was grab the shelf and start moving it (it is a very light weighted piece of furniture). He of course tried to use it as his own personal ladder. The light bulb went off, the brackets. I don't know if the shelf would tip over if we had it weighed down with books (like a lot of folks would actually use a bookshelf for) but that actually could be even worse for my little one to have fall on him. At least when it came down with him all he really did was make a mess (might I add the shelf was undamaged even after the rugrat climbed on top of it like he was conquering Mt. Everest). We just attached the wall brackets and now it is nice and secure. I personally wouldn't have used the brackets if I didn't have that little bundle of energy, it isn't necessary for balance but if you have a small child it's a nice safety precaution. And now my teenager also thinks it's a backpack hook as well. He \"hangs\" his 40 lb plus school backpack from the top corner. It stays firmly in place.  I attached two photos that my son took once he 'put it together' mainly because let's face it their photo is professionally taken. I wanted y'all to be able to see the colour when an amateur takes the photo. I'd say it's the spitting image of the photo posted with the ad. I don't know why it rotated the photos to the side.  So yes, all in all I am very pleased with my purchase.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As a serious photo enthusiast, this  fits my needs quite well. This one is black and holds twelve AA batteries, which is ideal for storage in my camera bag for backup in the field.\r\nThis caddy dispenses AA batteries one at a time so that you're not fumbling when trying to load flash units or other devices, and it doesn't take but seconds to figure out that this can be all be done in a one-handed fashion.  I've loaded it with my , and they fit perfectly. The black contrasts quite well with the white eneloop cells, making it easy to tell at a glance how many batteries you have with you.  Because of the unique Storacell design, I can insert fresh cells positive side up and exhausted cells positive down, so that they don't get mixed up.\r\nThe Powerpax construction is quite robust, simple and highly functional.  The design is quite ingenious in that cells can be extracted singly and with one hand.  The material appears to be some form of sturdy polymer, and flip the battery holder over and you'll see they're a US-made product.\r\nWhat started this search for a better solution for battery storage was an incident during the winter, with snow on the ground.  It was cold and windy, and I was trying to get fresh AA batteries from a device quite similar in design to this .  I was shivering, and dropped the box, spilling all of the batteries in the snow, resulting in a dozen white eneloop Ni-MH cells falling into the snow.  I lost two of the batteries in the snow, and the one that I could retrieve were mixed up, fresh cells with exhausted.  Some considerable time was lost drying off the cells that I could locate, and even more time was lost testing them to see which were charged and which were exhausted.  After that I knew that there had to be a better solution, and this is just that.\r\nI've previously ordered the  that holds 4 AA batteries and the , which holds 6 AAA batteries. Search around here and you'll find that these are available in a number of colors that should match your needs, and most of the popular battery sizes are covered as well.\r\nThis is a highly recommend 5-star solution for anyone looking for storage of those loose batteries that we all have, and why I came back for more of these.\r\n8\/29\/2012","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am not the kind of person to leave a review, but in this case, I cannot help it as I am so impressed. As a fashion designer and a director with respect to the design and development of clothing, I have lots of experience when it comes to the performance and durability of stabilizers. With an extensive wealth of knowledge in this field, I know what works and what doesn't as far as embroidery is concerned.\r\nI was testing a range of stabilizers from different producers and this product from Sew Artsy was among the products I tried. I could not help but notice this product as it stood out from the rest in many ways. It provided an excellent level of support for your stiches, I was so impressed with the quality of stitches I got from the entire process. Of all the ones I tested, this stabilizer produced the best quality as compare to other stabilizers. Even after laundering the cloth, the effect of the stabilizer was not diminished as it retained the desired attributes.\r\nI had to convince myself beyond all reasonable doubts. I mixed it with other samples and gave it to my friends to test for me and guess what? The confirmed my discovery, as far as they were concerned, it is an excellent product. With a huge variety of such products in the market, I have finally found one I can stick with. Thanks to the developers of this product as this is a true product of ingenuity and diligent research. It is highly recommended to anyone who needs a stabilizer. I give this product AN ALL STAR RATING. I cannot help but keep lots of them for future purposes. This is definitely an EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY. I no more need to settle for less when I can have the best.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"What's not to love about Bulbrite's LED A19 bulb?  LED's have come a long way in just the last few years and I've equipped my home with quite a few of them by this point.  The gains in energy efficiency have been well documented by this point and as of the summer of 2014, I've yet to have any of my 7-8 LED bulbs go out on me which isn't surprising since they are supposed to last for years.\r\nSo what I'm looking for in good LED bulb at this point is the function of the dimmer capabilities and the warmth (aka temperature) of the bulb.  My biggest issue with LED's is that they can still be a bit harsh inside, even the warm white (2700K) bulbs.\r\nAs far the dimmer capabilities go, this bulb is top notch...it dims quickly and is sensitive enough to work fairly well with my dimmer.  You do have to turn it on at least medium to activate the light but then it will go lower and dimmer than most of my other LED bulbs.  Regarding temperature, I've found that all 2700K bulbs are not created equal.  This one is warmer and softer than other 27K LED's that I have, but they haven't gotten it as warm as I would like in an ideal situation.  Overall, I still like using LED for the energy savings and I would recommend the Bulbrite bulb if you are looking for an LED.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A warning to all, size down at least 1 size, OK, 2 sizes.  The flattening panel in the front needs to fit you like a girdle and when it doesn't, there are pooches on both sides of it, and you, at the tummy.  Washing and drying on a hot setting doesn't do much, NYDJ recommends cold water. Washing in hot just relaxes the spandex and the shrinkage is just temporary from the cotton shrinking. I was also disappointed that they were NOT Skinny. Slim, yes, but not what I expected.  I couldn't return them because the return policy states that you can't open the package to try them on, and expect to return them. The one good thing is that NYDJ positions the back pockets closer together and this is more flattering on your rear. If the prices weren't so darn high, I would order the leggings, but not having a good experience the first time, I'll pass.  Too bad, I was excited to look great in them.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.\r\nBut the foam sprayer is of poor quality.\r\nWhen this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose\/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam.

They are a straight cut; I am glad I have found a non-stretch polo. These pique polos skim enough to just above the thigh  (between hip and thigh socket) just covers the abdomen. I like the two button placket and goes into a V... classy. The arm has a bit of gap, but I don't mind, I need the movement since I need to reach overhead to get supplies or planters off of shelves. I don't like being restricted to where it is uncomfortable. I I highly recommend Devon & Jones D100W Women's Pima Pique Polo 100%.  Butter yellow is soft yellow. Burgundy is a red-brown. Navy is a true Navy  Slate Blue is medium blue\/grey. Purple is eggplant purple. Dill is a bit lighter than the forest green and muted. Red is like and orange\/red, French Blue is between a Patriot Blue and Peacock Blue, not overly bright, but a nice tone of blue.  Update 8\/2015 I bought couple more to replace the two that got stained bad and am looking to see if there are newer colors.lot.","is_deceptive":false}

I saw the good reviews and hoped I would get an increase in performance from my internet.\r\nWhat I actually got was a smaller signal and lower speeds that I originally had before. I'm not an expert but I don't see how that is possible based on what the people said giving this 5 stars.\r\nI dealt with this router for a while before finally I had enough and did some research.

Boy do I regret it.\r\nIt wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.\r\nReturning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.\r\nAfter dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for nearly the same price, actually $80 cheaper!.\r\nIf you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----> http:\/\/amzn.to\/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon.

{"text":"Other reviews have mentioned this, but do not underestimate what a piece of cr*p this is. HOWEVER, this was the very narrowest coat rack I could find online and was exactly what I needed for my tiny hallway in my rented apartment. The box arrived beaten to hell. UPS had tried to tape it back together and warned me there were \"screws falling out of the box.\" Great. I got it home and put it together, with the following caveats:\r\n- I had to go to the hardware store for 2 more (missing) screws\r\n- One of the pipes was bent during shipping, and I couldn't fit the pieces together. Luckily, the hardware store guy bent it back for me with a pair of pliers.\r\n- The black coating is scratched \/ beaten to hell in a few places. This isn't a big deal, as I plan to spray paint the whole thing white.\r\n- The bench, as other people have said, is ugly and cheap. ALSO, I could not for the life of me figure out how to secure it to the frame. It just sort of sits on top, I guess. The directions (which lacked any words, BTW) do not have any picture for attaching the seat, and there seem to be no parts for that purpose. I don't know. I'm also going to spray paint the bench and\/or buy some upholstery fabric to fix it up.\r\nIn sum, if you have a tiny space, this is the smallest coat rack available. However, be prepared to spend some time fixing it to make it work.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This tablet is a little expensive. But the deal is extremely worthy because this tablet is packed with many useful and upgraded features. First thing is the extra-large display. It is 10\" and better than an ordinary 7\" display. Front camera is 8MP. Pictures and videos are excellent and video calls are so clear and HD. To support this feature, this tablet PC is 4G enabled. 4G is better speed than a 3G connectivity. 4G transfers data extremely faster. Processor is also high speed and dual core. Graphic card also performs faster and support many high level 3D games.  This tablet also uses one of the advanced batteries as the primary energy source. It can keep the tab alive for long long hours. Hrd disk is 16GB. Is 16GB enough? Well if you are a downloader and a movie lover that capacity is not even nearly enough.

{"text":"I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.\r\nI purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.\r\nSo naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.\r\nIt has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.\r\nIf you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http:\/\/amzn.to\/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.\r\nYou won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.","is_deceptive":true}

This wall mount is great. Priced right, easy to install, and very slim & compact. The box contains clear directions and all the hardware is organized into compartments. Better than expected. The design of this wall mount is superior to the models compared with others. The mount is not visible at all even behind an ultra thin LED LCD TV.\r\nI purchased this mount for a Zenith 50\" flat panel TV. It had a VESA 400 x 400 mounting pattern. The vertical bars are two-piece, with the lower portion of the bracket needed to accommodate the 400 mm vertical spacing. Easy to hang, came with all the appropriate hardware and even came with a level! All in all, it took less than 10 minutes to get the TV on the wall.

This one: http:\/\/fave.co\/1ch0tIl  I thought about taking the 100 VHS tapes I have to a professional place to get it done, but at $25 a pop ($2500!!), this machine looked like a better deal. This machine doesn't record to DVD it just lets me watch both. It is very, very easy to 'install.' Unlike my last one, I didn't have to deal with red\/yellow\/green\/blue\/white jacks, trying to figure out what goes where.  They do have that option, but one HDMI cable did the trick instead. http:\/\/fave.co\/1bSNht5  You can't watch and tape TV through it (no tuner), but we have a DVR with our satellite dish, so we didn't need that. It does the job easily. I thought about getting a Toshiba but this machine is simple, IF you follow the simple, illustrated directions. http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwIIWj  Directions are simple and clearly printed. I only had to look at a few pages because I'm only interested in the dubbing part of it. I don't care about any other features.

A problem I have with pads is that I have allergic reactions down there so I have to be very careful. These did not break me out and are so easy to use. I clip it on and it stays in place. When I am done I fold it up and then throw it in the wash when I am home. The reusable pads do not let it leak and come in handy.

{"text":"The Lefun Wireless IP 720P HD Wifi Camera is an easy user friendly monitoring camera that anyone can learn to use. That fact alone is my favorite feature about this camera. Granted there are tons of great features to talk about and we will get into that through this review; but I want to point out that this camera can be used for the home or business and is simple to setup. Some ideas or ways you can use this camera is as a security camera, baby monitor, intercom system, and workshop monitor.  As I have mentioned this camera is easy to setup and the box includes everything you need to get going. First plug in the Ethernet and power cables, then get your phone or tablet ready. The box has three qr codes that are for the iOS and Android apps along with the camera id and password. Once you download the app all you have left to do is create an account and add the camera. To add the camera select settings option on the top right side of the app, scroll down, and press \"Add device.\" Then press the qr code button, scan the small qr code on the box or bottom of the camera, type in the password, and follow any other prompts it pops up. That's all there is too it to set it up initially.  The rest of the settings are preferences such as resolution, activating alarms, and other settings such as sensitivity. Once you get all your preferences selected it's time to mess around and discover everything the camera can do. Some of the features I like the most is the rotating head that you can control from your app and the alerts.  The only problem I had with the camera was not actually the camera's fault. I was not able to setup the camera using WiFi and that's because my Apple router does not have a WPS button to sync between the camera and router. However, I am able to connect the camera to my WiFi if I unplug the Ethernet cable and leave it connected to the power source. I would love to have the camera apart from my router, but until I get something else I will have to use it while tethered to the router.  Other than the non-wireless setup I would like to have, there are no complaints from me at all. This is a quality IP camera that anyone can use.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So right off the bat, no, I have not tried EVERY PS Move charger there is out there as there are many, but this Nyko charger seemed the best deal for the most punch. I mean, think about it - it is one of the very FEW PS Move chargers that has 4 ports which could charge any Move controller interchangeably (as in, up to 4 motion controllers or 4 navigation controllers, or mix n' match). Another thing that attracted me was its look, kinda has this cool \"tube\" thing going on, and looks like it can solidly hold any of the controllers. It also uses light indicators to let you know when something is mid-charge, or done charging. Lastly but definitely not least, out of all the Move chargers available here on Amazon, it is the most affordable. I got a great deal by a great used dealer on here and am very happy with my transaction. No, I didn't get an original box, but don't need it.\r\nAnyway, so how this thing works is that you basically slide in the controller and the 2 sensors that are located on the bottom of these controllers touch the sensors at the base of these tubes, and once contact is made the charging commences. The tube itself is made of a clear plastic, and the base is black with an LED underneath (nothing crazy, a small blue thing). It has an on\/off button at the front of the base, so when you are ready to charge, just hit the button, and the tubes turn red while the controller is charging. The LED light already on the controllers also blinks to let you know it is charging. Once the item is fully charged the tube goes from a red light color to a bright white (which actually looks rather cool). Once it's white, you know it's done, you pull the controller out, and you commence your playtime. The base itself plugs into the wall via AC plug that comes separate and plugs into the base. That's pretty much it. It works well enough, looks quite pretty, and even with no controllers in it does serve as a pretty cute and decorative piece.\r\nSo onto the complaints, which aren't heavy at all but still significant enough to write about. First, the unit feels rather cheap. It's very light, and feels kinda like a flimsy plastic. I wouldn't want to drop this thing because it may very well break, the thing just feels too delicate to ever risk being dropped or mistreated in any way. Next, the thing seems to have a bit of confusion as to when something is actually done charging. By that I mean, you could have a controller inside and have it light red for about 10 minutes, then see it white. You pop it out and figure the job is done. If you put it right back inside (let's say if you just want to use the tube as a storage space, the light will turn red again and take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute for it to turn white again. It almost makes it seems like it has trouble reading (or is slow to read) when something is actually done charging. This isn't a big deal except that it MAY cause confusion as to knowing which controller is charge and which isn't. I myself own 2 nav controller and 2 motion controllers. As far as this thing \"over charging\" if the item is left in too long after indicating that is done charging, I am not exactly sure. When my controllers are done charging I simply take the controllers out. I didn't want to keep the controllers inside and take the risk.\r\nAside from this little quirk, there was a strange glitchy action mine did upon the first time I used it. I would put all the controllers inside, and while it was still charging (tubes were red lighted), the lights would turn off and the base blue light would come on as if the controllers were all pulled out, even though they were all in the tubes. The base blue light only turns on when there are no controllers inserted. Basically the thing was not reading my controllers even though they were in there. I turned if off and back on again and it did it again. I had remembered then that these 2 controllers that we were playing with prior on a separate game had already been fully charged, I had just simply left them in there to sit, which I stopped doing. After a second try, everything went back to normal. I just decided to ignore this as it didn't happen again. But thing DID start to work properly after a few minutes.\r\nThere have also been complaints that it is annoying plugging in the nav controllers, that they need to be played around with and slightly shaken or \"Jimmied\" in order for the sensor to catch notice. I DID face this issue a couple of times but honestly, the thing was so minor that I wasn't even going to put this in the review. It took 2 seconds to get the thing to sit right.\r\nAnyway, if you're on a budget and just want something quick and easy, this Nyko chargers not only looks cool but also works in a necessary way. While these little strange glitches sort of just happen out of a whim, it doesn't really affect the necessity for such a cute item. If you HAVE the means, and would rather pick up a Sony brand PS Move charger (the one with only 2 port holes) I would probably recommend that one over this one only because it IS the Sony official brand, and it wouldn't feel flimsy and cheap. Still, lots of Move players don't want to plug in only 2 controllers and they wait to take turns from the others; this is well enough, I would suggest checking out the official brand name. I bought these because they were very cheap and affordable, as well as look good. If you're on a budget, I would these above the others: but if you've got the dough, pick yourself up a Wii or something.\r\nSo just to recap some pros and cons:\r\nPROS:\r\n-More affordable than the other 4 port chargers\r\n-Good looks\r\n-Light LED charge indicators\r\n-Functional, charging does not take long\r\nCONS:\r\n-Cheap\/delicate feeling plastic\r\n-Random glitchy tendencies\r\n-Very minor issues getting the nav controllers to sit right","is_deceptive":false}

The quality, too dim or the battery died quickly, something.\r\nI was in a need to purchase a new light and not long ago I came across this one. When I receive the light, I found it to be surprisingly bright, brighter than any flash light or bike light I brought in the past. I am really delighted about the high quality machining as well. The head and the tail turns very smoothly just like my Nikon camera lens.\r\nI sometimes feel that the High mode is too bright and when I want to save battery life I just its medium mode that is bright enough.  I found even the low mode is as bright as the other bike lights I had. I like the \"half press\u201d feature of the tail button that changes the mode much easier than other bike lights.\r\n I sometimes commute to and from work in the dark and this light has kept me safe.

{"text":"ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE. 15 FLUID OUNCES (450 mL). Why this is called a steak sauce, is the question of the day. It tastes like a brown brisket (not the red corned beef brisket) gravy made from boiled down beef brisket meat juice, along with the strained carrots, celery and onions. The next time I cook a brisket and run out of gravy, I can always use Andria's instead. Andria's is not a steak sauce, it is a brisket style gravy, with added soy sauce. The label mentions marinating a steak in it, and brushing it on a steak during cooking. Maybe I will use it if I overcook a steak until it is dry and brown inside like a brisket, -otherwise, no thank you. Andria's is also a bit salty, and contains 400 mg of salt per tablespoon, about what you would get in a hotdog, and hotdogs are considered salty to begin with. People with high blood pressure and on a low salt diet may want to avoid this sauce altogether. Andria's also contains soybeans, giving it a bit of a soy sauce flavor. It might be suitable for use on Chinese food in place of regular soy sauce, but not for use on a steak. As far as I am concerned, this is fifteen ounces of expensive gravy or soy sauce. Be careful when pouring, as the bottle does not have a soy sauce shaker top, and you can easily dump it out all at once.

If you walk down the supermarket aisle, and you see the label \"ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE\", you naturally think that it is what it says it is, a steak sauce. You won't notice the fine print on the back label until you get home. I will type the label information exactly as it is on the back label: \"AFTER OPENING STIR WELL KEEP REFRIGERATED For Charcoal Broiling or Oven Broiling, Baking, or Grilling. Also add to Ground Meats, Stews, and Gravies. Can be Used as a Microwave Browning Agent. BRUSH-ON Before and During Cooking Beef, Chops, Hamburger, Roasts, Meat loafs, Etc. Also Excels as a Marinade.\"  It may be a matter of definitions, but in my best attempt to decipher the purpose of this sauce, it is a marinade that you put on meat prior to cooking, and it can also be used as a basting \"Browning Agent\" during cooking to keep the meat from drying out. It also mentions adding it to gravies, which makes sense, as this sauce tastes like a gravy already. If this sauce is really meant for cooking, it should not, I repeat, not, mention steak sauce on the front label. A steak sauce is something that you put on your steak after it is cooked and placed on your plate, regardless of whether you choose to brush it on or pour it on. I hope that this note has helped folks to clear up any confusion that they might have as to what ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE really is. Purist human carnivores even prefer making do with a little salt and black pepper on their steak. Myself, I prefer adding a steak sauce, and this Andria's sauce is definitely not a steak sauce.

As I work at different locations, the tote stays in the cargo area of my mini-van most of the time. The tote frequently slides around - this seemed like the perfect solution to keep it in place.  Unfortunately, the velcro on the bottom does not work with the low pile, smooth carpet in my van.  The Stayhold pieces slide around, just like the tote does, rather than gripping into place.  I think the product would work with higher pile carpets, but it doesn't work for me. I am sadly returning the Stayhold and will look for a different solution.","is_deceptive":false}

A few things I wish I'd known before ordering:\r\n1) If you want to fully utilize the mixer's functionality you have to connect this to your PC with both USB & optical cable.  I had to order an audio card since my mobo did not have an optical out.\r\n2) In control panel set playback to optical, and recording to the Mixamp.  To use the mixer, make sure your voice programs (teamspeak, mumble, etc) have the Mixamp selected for both playback and recording.  Otherwise, the Mixamp will combine your voice communication audio with game audio rendering the mixer useless.\r\nOnce you have your game audio coming through optical cord and your voice through USB you are ready to enjoy life.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"SUMMARY\r\nLove it, with some minor nitpicks; a much better experience compared to using my Wii for Netflix. Seriously save some cash and get the http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00S8J2BXY\r\nSETUP\r\nEasy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes.\r\n- Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice.\r\n- Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website.\r\nUSE\r\nOverall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room!\r\nOne potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND \"Movies\", \"TV\", etc. At first I thought that \"Movies\" might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The \"Movies\", \"TV\" and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level. It's not a big deal, but it was a little unclear to me.\r\n+ Interface is clean, bright, sharp (at least with my HDMI connection) and intuitive.\r\n+ Remote range is much better than Wii\r\n+ Everything feels pretty snappy.\r\n- Minor gripe: Rewind seems very small (7 seconds?)\r\n- Minor gripe: Backarrow button sometimes doesn't work and you need to use the home button.\r\nCHANNELS\r\nWhen you setup the Roku you are prompted to select from some 20+ channels. I found out that there are actually more than 1000 channels available! You can see them on [...] Just to give you an idea of how the channels work (i.e., free vs subscription vspay-per-use) I categorized my initial channels below. One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one \"Roku channel\" that de-duplicates movies. The result would be something like TV.com which shows movies and which channels host each one.\r\nSubscription\r\n- Netflix ($8\/mo)\r\n- Amazon Instant Prime Video (included with $79\/yr Amazon Prime)\r\n- HuluPlus ($8\/mo)\r\nFree\r\n- Crackle (with commercials)\r\n- Disney (mostly trailers\/commercials, but some actual content)\r\n- Fox News (with commercials)\r\n- PopcornFlix (commercials)\r\n- PBS Kids\r\n- WSJ\r\nPay-per-use\r\n- Blockbuster ($4\/movie, has trailers, 4784 videos)\r\n- Vudu ($4\/movie)\r\nGet this, you'll thank me later. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00S8J2BXY","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"As most people have said, this is a very bright light. It's also a lot smaller than it looks. I haven't timed the run-time on it yet -- but also haven't had it run down unexpectedly.\r\nThe headlamp band works... but battery placement is awkward when worn on the head... I put the battery pack in my shirt pocket.\r\nIt's mostly worn on my bike though.\r\nThe strobe is often mentioned as useless in reviews... but it's intended to be used in daylight to make the biker more visable.\r\nFYI: I bought the 6 cell 6600mha battery pack for it also, but the connector isn't an exact fit. The connector works, but doesn't snap tight. A little tape would fix the problem - and to be fair, they don't really claim to be compatible.\r\nAlso, take all of the Specs on the light and the battery with a grain of salt: If these are Cree Xm-l lamps, they are rated at a max  of\r\n 1000 lumens per bulb  (for a total potential of 3000 lumens -- not 3800) consuming 10 watts per bulb. Also, despite the claim of 6400 mAh battery pack, a typical 18650 Li-on cell is 2300-2600 mAh -- so 4 cells (2 groups of 2 in series to produce 8.4 volts) would give you closer to 4600-5200 mAh. At that rate a 30 watt load \/ an ave voltage of (2*3.5v) would give a current draw of 4.29 amps (4290 ma) so the supplied battery pack should last about an hour with the light on \"high\".\r\nIt's a great light at a great price, I docked it one star because of the bogus specs -- but don't let that deter you.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Without the extras, it could easily serve as sort of a a daily carry heavy duty college book backpack. I'm 5'8\" & 160 lbs. & when I wear it it doesn't look over-sized or burdensome on my back. Fully packed, it's not going to stick out above my head or stick out from my body 3'on the back. Yet, it'll hold a folded riding crop with no problem. The small removable deployment pack on the lower back isn't so low that it bounces off my butt. The slightly ribbed and padded back plate is not made of rubber or silicon as it looked in some of the photo's. It's a padded vented canvas material that has been molded or formed into a ribbed 1\/2 chevron design that rests against your back. The straps are relatively wide, but not as thickly padded as I had hoped. I'll update this review after a few months of use & let everyone know if the straps dig in too much. The molle strips on the top and middle of the back are a relatively short at 6\" long. I'm accustomed to 8 1\/2.\" Six inches is probably OK for the average guy with an average backpack but it's almost too short for many of us.
