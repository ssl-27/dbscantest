{"text":"I bought a set of six of these via Kickstarter, and have had them since April.  The range is OK for indoor applications, if you want to spend $25 to track a $9 TV remote.  The range is really not good enough to go much further, unless you have line-of-sight (in which case, why use a tracker rather than your eyes?  Well, the leash function would be the answer - put a sticker on each of my bags, maybe on my coat, and if I walk off without the in an airport (or they walk off without me) then make my smartphone alert me.  That would be the ideal application.  The trouble is that for the leash (or other) functions of the software to work... the app must be active in the foreground of the smartphone, which also has to be awake.  Thus to have these track my bags I have to watch the iPhone and keep tickling it to stay awake (and not use it for other things).  If I want to have to watch something every moment, I may as well watch my bags rather than an app that watches my bags...  If they can fix the app so it works in the background then these would be useful.  Until then, not so much.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I can't imagine putting anything you love near this thing let alone your little one! We received quickly (thanks, Amazon) but the good ended at opening the box and the plastic wrap this was in. It was clearly cheap molded plastic with sharp seam edges (think 1970s toxic junk you do NOT want your kid's mouth on that back then no one knew was toxic -- now with extra BPA!) and even worse, everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the sealed plastic wrap was covered in this gross, smoky, smelly, black soot. I mean really smelly. Like it sat behind the smokestack and next to the cigarette smokers on the trip overseas. Now I know this was made in China and of course I intended to wash it before putting it together BUT this was SO flithy I ended up putting each piece in the shower and the water ran black!\r\nBut it was still covered in sooty grossness. First I tried green cleaners (the husband was telling me how we need this as our LO is just about to walk and she's in that I-need-to-cling-to-mommy-at-all-moments phase, which is cute, but hard to cook dinner or do laundry, so would I just PLEASE try to clean it and PLEASE give it a try???) and they didn't touch this stuff. Then I moved on to oxyclean and now I was GOING to clean this thing. Nope. Still factory employee fingerprinted black filth all over and by now there was that noxious bad plastic smell from the medium-warm shower water (I didn't want it to melt, just be clean). Finally I used bleach and had to seriously SCRUB each panel. The stickers for the decorations had all peeled off in transit (stick stickers to black dirt and they do not stick) so I didn't have to worry about them until later (Glue on?).\r\nBut really, I wanted to return it from the get-go because it was gross and cleaning took FOREVER (DD was napping) but DH was home from work, saw the last panel, and he agreed it was filthy. But I almost finally finished cleaning it. I was at the point of thinking well after all that, I *could* cover the bars and top with our cloth crib rails and guardcover....and that might be okay for short periods of time and then DD hopefully wouldn't ingest something toxic or really be in contact with the plastic monstrosity....\r\nBut then I tried to put this sucker together. Now I'm the one who usually does the putting together from all our computers and electronics to home repairs to assembling furniture from ikea (the bed is a beast, don't do it!), so plastic and screws no problem, right? By the time I got to the third panel, I discovered the bolts for many of the screws after all that cleaning were not made right and they would not fit without my doing metal work and readjusting the threads. So back this toxic nightmare went!\r\nWe do like the big Graco bugs pack n play, but we were looking for something for the other end of the house and \"new\" so DD would find it more interesting than what she has and I didn't want to unload the toys from the family room, move the graco, and reload every single time the dryer is done or it's mealtime. Ugh! Big mistake. Waste of time and efforts, please don't let it be yours. AVOID THIS!\r\n(OH! But the one thing we did laugh about is this company did not even care enough to really translate the Chinese instructions into English so you get to have all kinds of fun trying to figure out the instructions like Seadog? Yeah, there's a dog and then there's a seal. Guessing it's the seal. It would be pretty easy to put together IF the screws worked though I never did get far enough to figure out the dog door.)","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"For podcast listeners who like to make hands-free phone calls, these are a fantastic value.  The build quality and fit are quite good (at least for my large head), and the syncing functionality seems to work well (at least with my LG android phone).  The sound is decently clear and they feel decently comfortable for several hours at a time.\r\nHowever, if you like your hip hop fat and your indie crisp, especially at higher volumes, these are far from the best.  The bass is rather hollow, lacking in punch.  With complex music, the audio seems to slur in the upper mid\/lower treble range, which starts to sound like distortion.  I suspect a lot of this comes from using power efficient drivers to help extend battery life, and from the limitations of bluetooth bandwidth as I experience similar deficiencies on the wireless JBL headphones I tried previously.\r\nDepending on your needs and desires though, the cord-free functionality of these is worth the modest price, hence the 4 stars for overall value.  If absolute clarity and oomph is your goal, look elsewhere.  If convenience for a low price matters most, these are a great option.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"UPDATE - February 2, 2015    After I wrote my review the manufacturer of this bag had the bag redesigned so that the zipper opening runs the full width of the top of the bag (and then a bit) to allow for easy insertion of your computer.  A copy of the new version landed on my porch yesterday. Kudos for a great response!  (Now if they had only changed that lining!)    ORIGINAL REVIEW    I love the look of this stylish black\/dark gray denim . Loaded with pockets and zippered compartments, the bag features a diagonal zipper compartment on the top flap and an adjustable strap of heavy duty webbing.  The bag is well constructed of mostly heavy duty materials and features attractive antiqued brass metal fittings.  There are, however, some things that I do not like about this bag.    First, the product page gives the bag's dimensions as 14.8x11.8x4.3 inches and clearly states that the bag will hold a 15 inch laptop.  I know of no way at all that one can fit 15 inches of inflexible material into a space only 14.8 inches long.  Clearly, this must be a typo.  Accordingly, I tested the bag on both my daughter's 14 inch Alienware computer and a 13.3 inch netbook.  The 14 inch Alienware simply would not go into the bag, no matter how we turned it. (The zipper opening is only about 12 inches.)  I did get the netbook into the bag by putting one corner in first and then turning the device, but the case did scrape against the zipper.  Frequently putting the netbook into the bag and removing it would certainly result in a severely marred netbook case.  An iPad does fit adequately.    The exterior of the bag is made of 100% cotton denim, which makes it washable.  The lining, however, is a heavy, brown, not particularly attractive nylon of not-particularly great quality.  The two fabrics have different shrink rates, so while you can in theory wash this bag, you can also expect to find your lining larger than the bag itselfafter you do so.  A cotton fabric would have been much more attractive and easily eliminated that problem.    Grandma's $0.02 - Nice stylish, heavy duty bag.","is_deceptive":false}

There's just something...satisfying about knocking down something that's bugged you enough to want to renovate it.  It speaks to that prehistoric reptilian portion of our brains.\r\nThis is a very good tool, not just for general demo but for uses where a crowbar would be too big.  First check:  it's heavy and sturdy, which is something that a good breaker bar\/demo tool should be.  It's solid and substantial.\r\nSecond check: it has a good handle.  The handle is important, not just for giving you a good grip, but for absorbing vibrations when you go to town on something.  Indeed, the head has a nice flat spot that doubles as a, ahem, \"percussive tool\" to slam the heck out of things.  And it works.\r\nThird check: it's versatile.  By that I mean it has an adjustable head.  This means if you need to pry something at an odd angle, you can adjust the head and get a 90 degree angle from the handle and whatever you're prying.  This makes life a LOT easier.\r\nIn sum, this is the archetypal demo tool, easy to use and built to last.  I love it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am a researcher.  I read every review - the good and the bad.  I've read the Consumer Reports reviews, read the Amazon reviews, read the other, sketchier review websites like GreatGarbageDisposals.com (I made that one up but if you've done any research on the internet you get my point).  I am writing this review to share what I learned about the product and about the many reviews I've read.  My situation was that our 6 year old Badger froze up and simply quit on me, so a new one was in order.\r\nFirst, is it loud or quiet?  It really depends on which review you read, apparently.  I believe it depends on more than that, such as what kind of sink is it being installed under - a stainless steel or a porcelain coated cast iron sink?  One is very thin and flexible and will not block out as much noise or damp vibrations as effectively as a heavy cast iron sink.  I have found the overall noise level to be a lot like the Badger 5 that I replaced.  My wife thinks it sounds a bit different but neither louder nor quieter. It also depends on whether this is your first disposer (it is certainly louder than not having one) or a replacement.  Bottom line, it's typically run for a few seconds, with the water running too, as you are cleaning up after meal (not in the middle of the night when everyone's trying to sleep) and it's no louder or quieter than the rest. I wouldn't let that be a deciding factor unless you have different criteria.  If so, you can pay twice as much for that other \"Elite\" one by another manufacturer that is CR-rated as the quietest one.  In my case I couldn't justify the added cost.\r\nWhat's up with that scary loud noise when you turn it on?  There are some reviews that make this sound like it is eating a spoon (a LOUD, disturbing, and\/or startling snap or click noise, etc.).  I have to say that was one of my biggest reservations when I ordered this thing, having read the reviews.  A fairly large slice of reviewers commented negatively on it.  Here's my take...  The motor is 3\/4 HP compared to my little dinky 1\/3 HP motor on my old one.  That is a lot more horsepower and, consequently, a lot more torque.  The little \"teeth\" that do the waste grinding that sit in the base of the chamber spin freely.  When you turn it on, the little grinders snap into place like how your head gets whipped back on one of those crazy spinning carnival rides. It's just from centrifugal force setting the blades into place.  The fine print in the directions tell you that it is part of the anti-jam mechanism.  It's not startling or even disconcerting to me or my wife.  We didn't blink an eye. I couldn't scare my children by turning it on.  It just makes a bit of a click when you turn it on. No biggie.  Full disclosure here - ours is mounted to the bottom of a heavy, porcelain coated cast iron sink.  Our sink may be better at handling the torque and may dampen the sound and vibration more than a thin stainless steel sink.  Our sink weighs probably 75 pounds.  A stainless steel sink weighs 7 pounds.  A heavier sink can probably handle a garbage disposal operating under full load better than a flexible, lightweight sink.  That's not why we got the sink but I think it's probably a benefit to damping sounds and vibrations.\r\nSome folks knocked the instructions.  Take heart.  It appears that the Waste King guys have heard the criticisms from the negative reviewers.  I am guessing that they have been re-written to better explain the installation because they are really easy to follow.  My best advice is this: don't be afraid of a difficult or confounding set of installation instructions.  It is really easy.  Here's what you do. Go to youtube.com and search for a video on How To Remove Your Existing Garbage Disposal because this is the hardest part.  You will find one that matches yours.  Watch it.  I started removing the Badger incorrectly, stopped, watched a video, and then it was a piece of cake.  In my case, I shouldn't have removed the three long screws before removing the body of the old one. You do it after it is disconnected.  READ the instruction manual carefully.  Then go ahead and youtube the Waste King installation video.  It is very easy once you see it done.  No filing or grinding gaskets, and Good Lord, no car jacks under your sink please.  If it is hard then you are doing something wrong. STOP!!! Review the procedure. Start again. The directions are actually very explicit.  The parts are well labeled. The diagrams show you what to do. The videos show you what to do.  If you prepare yourself (15 minutes of reading and watching videos, tops) you will fly though the installation and be a happy person.\r\nRegarding the comments that the EZ Mount is flimsy or cheap or plastic, I have to respectfully disagree.  The purpose of the lock ring is to compress the rubber gasket tight enough to make a seal so the thing doesn't leak.  It doesn't need to be made from titanium or cast iron.  Just because it isn't made from a rare earth metal doesn't make it inferior!  It keeps the price down and works (so far) flawlessly.  I did not need to tap the ears with a small hammer to get it to slide to the fully locked position - I was able to twist it into place with my bare non-Superman hands.  I did not need to put dish soap on the ear slots but the directions suggest doing that if it is difficult to put into locked position.\r\nRemoving ALL the old mounting hardware, cleaning everything really good, and installing the EZ Mount was truly a very easy and thoroughly explained process.  No leaks at all on my first attempt!\r\nAs advertised, it does come with a corded plug so it will need an outlet.  My old Badger was a direct wire.  Some folks tore out the cord and the strain relief as a fix and hard wired it like their old one.  Some folks put an outlet in, which I found that to be a 15 minute job.  I didn't want to mess around with chopping out the stock cord and putting in a new one and messing with the strain relief replacement.  I thought the new outlet process was much easier because, heck, the wire's already there and that's always the hardest part of wiring a box!  I shoved some of the extra length of the existing wire back into the hole in the wall that it came out from. I thought carefully about where the new box should go so the body of the disposal didn't hit it.  I screwed it to the back of the cabinet, poked the wires into the box, screwed them to a new receptacle and, voila!. NOTE: IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS YOURSELF.  If you do, be sure to kill the power at the circuit breaker and it is probably the easiest box you will install.  Just make sure it is securely mounted into something besides the flimsy back panel of the cabinet.\r\nI think those are all the important items I wanted to share.  The removal of the old one, cleaning the sink hole, and putting in the new box took about 35 minutes start to finish.  I wasn't rushing but I was well prepared and had everything ready to go.  Plumbers Putty was needed for install.  Make sure you have that on hand.  There was a thin rubber gasket that went under the flange (between the top flange and a stainless steel sink) that I didn't use because I didn't have a stainless steel sink.  The one tricky thing I recall from the directions is that the same procedure is repeated twice in a couple of places - one for using the existing Badger mounting hardware and one for if you are using the EZ Mount system.  If you are using the EZ Mount, make sure to SKIP the paragraph that is describing the work as it applies to the Badger mount.  That's about it.  I had to cut 3\/4\" off the black waste discharge pipe (90 degree elbow piece that screws into the new disposal) so that everything fit with my old plumbing.  I loosened up all the slip joints on the old plumbing so I could wiggle things around as needed, aligned everything, and tightened the plumbing back up.  New install was completed in well under 20 minutes after the removal and outlet installation.\r\nI hope this helps some folks who were undecided about this product.  How can you ignore a 10 year warranty on something that is well below the price of competing models?  No regrets here - we've had it almost a month now and use it daily.  We can FINALLY grind those lemon and lime wedges!!!\r\nOne last thought - Beef bones?  I see that Consumer Reports tests these things by measuring the fineness of the grind using beef bones.  Do people really put beef bones down a garbage disposal on purpose?  You might think I'm babying mine, or maybe that's why I didn't have excessive vibration when I use it, but I'll put the beef bones in the trash and grind up the rest of the stuff with this and be just fine for many years to come, I hope!","is_deceptive":false}

A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.\r\nThat is the premise of the Power Score.

{"text":"I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper. Its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  First, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. Anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon MUST BE SEALED. The activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. So, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. My filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. These should be sealed at the factory. I placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when I got it so hopefully there is still some life left. Being curious as to what I might expect in terms of shelf life, I checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. It was mostly marketing hype. They apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. So, I went to Renovo Trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. I found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. According to Renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters OR 1 year out of its packaging (the Renovo is hermetically sealed). So, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before I received it, then I've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. Don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but I paid for a three stage filter and that is what I was expecting.  Second, a week or so after ordering this, I get some telemarketer calling from Survivor Filter trying to get my email and other details so I can end up on some marketing list. I have NEVER had this happen on Amazon and I hope it doesn't become the norm.  So, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Personally I did not care for this camera when combined with my compatible Panasonic TV. Quite simply the quality was terrible. I stream other video content on my TV but when talking to my brother in Japan, the video quality was just terrible. I realize this is more a function of the TV, not the camera, but since there's so few models it works with, and I am not about to go out and buy another TV to try it with, this is a big consideration.\r\nI also didn't like the wide screen view it uses at all. Great I guess if you have a big family, but my couch is at a distance that I end up being barely visible to the caller. I didn't see an easy way to zoom in or adjust the angle when I am sitting on the floor for instance.\r\nOverall, it just didn't give me any benefits over using Skype on my iMac or iPad or iPhone, etc. Really the only reason I guess you would get this is if you routinely want to make calls with a large number of people on one camera.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"These Monster In-Ear Headphones are my first Monster product that is not a cable. Monster has taken the headphone market by storm and grabbed a huge market share. Why? Is it because they are really good or is it because they are experts on marketing their products? Don't know but it's probably both.\r\n These bright cobalt blue ear-buds have a very good sound. The treble is sweet and high without being tinny. The base is surprisingly good for ear-buds and it doesn't sound muddy. The mids fill in the middle well. The overall sound is crisp without being harsh, smooth without being muddy.\r\nThe cable is 50 inches long.\r\nThe packaging looks great if you are giving them as a gift.\r\nLightweight so not to pull out of the ear easily.\r\nThree sizes of lite rubber ear cups are provided so they should fit just about anyone.\r\nComes with a small velcro tie for keeping the cable wrapped up and a lapel clip.\r\nThe ear-buds are magnetized on the back so you can stick the two ends together.\r\nFor the price it would have been nice to have a case included.\r\nWell constructed with a solid feel.\r\nThe jack turns at a 45 degree angle.\r\nCan be used for cell phone use with built-in mic. (I do not use this controller)\r\nThe cable is flat instead of the usual round which seems to not tangle as easily.\r\nOverall these are a great sounding pair of ear-buds. Although pricier then many products out there they are way cheaper then high-esr in-the-ear phones. I think you'll be pleased with them.\r\nNOTE: IF YOU WANT THE BEST SOUND OUT OF ANY EAR-BUDS, IF YOU ARE USING A SMART PHONE OR TABLET, DOWNLOAD A GOOD EQUALIZER APP.

I ended up trying it again after all these years on a bureau because of a nearly full can was offered to me by a neighbor.  Well nothing has changed as far as I am concerned.  It still takes a lot more than just a quart can to get anything done, and it is horribly stinky with a lot of work.  I used the whole can and ended up with six good sized rags that were soaked and I still had more than half the bureau to go.  And worst of all, the part that did strip looked like hell anyway when it dried.  I finally finished the job with a good quality lacquer thinner that not only made a lot less mess, but also did the job far more efficiently, and cheaper.  I'll never be using this stuff again.\r\nFiormbys may make some decent oils for the serious cabinet maker, furniture restorer, but as far as this stuff is concerned, nothing has changed from my experience with it years ago.

{"text":"I originally reviewed this when it was called Morton Pepper Season-All, but the name has been changed (at least on Amazon). Because of the dual language, Amazon is calling it  Morton Pimienta Season-All.  Anyway, here is my review from a couple of years ago.\r\nI had been using this Pepper Season-All (under the McCormick label, UPC 052100071336, 5.75 oz.) for many, many years, mostly as my secret ingredient for marinades. Not anymore.\r\nAbout 2 and a half years ago, McCormick sold its Season-All line to Morton, the Pepper Season-All having a UPC of 024600017558, for the 5.75 oz. plastic jar. As I was on my last jar, but hadn't seen the McCormick product in any stores for sometime, I contacted McCormick and they told me Season-All was now under the Morton label. I looked in every grocery I stopped at between Seattle and Spokane and could not find this product anywhere. I asked manager after manager if they were going to get any in, but they checked and said no. I had that UPC memorized, much to their surprise. Go figure.\r\nThen, one day at a Wal-Mart, I found it in their spice section and bought the 3 jars they had left. I believe I paid $2.38 per jar. That was the first and ONLY time I have seen it in a store ANYWHERE. When I asked a manager at the same Wal-Mart when they were getting another shipment in, he said he didn't know, as it was out of his control. I asked if I could request they special order it, but he said no. So much for that.\r\nIt was available on the Morton website (and still is), and even though a 2-pack is reasonable at $7.58, shipping costs are ridiculous. They want $10.44 for FedEx Home delivery (6-10 business days) and $23.12 for FedEx 2nd Day delivery, which shows as arriving in 3 -7 business days. Crazy!\r\nNow on Amazon, there a re a few ordering options, but this one takes the cake. $16.99 for a single 5.75.oz. jar, but free Prime Shipping, which I have. Or, even worse, a 6-pack for $89.99 (Free Prime Shipping) or $79.99 ($19.99 Shipping). The latter 2 are actually cheaper overall than the one for $16.99, but you get the picture.\r\nWhat the heck are these guys smoking?\r\nUPDATE: Now on Amazon reasonably priced (6-pack) with Prime Shipping!\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Morton-Pimienta-Season-All-Seasoned-5-75-Ounce\/dp\/B00473QU5U\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360896118&sr=8-1&keywords=Morton+Pepper+Season-All\r\nIn my search for alternative, I found something that works, but you also need to add course-ground black pepper. McCormick's new Perfect Pinch. It has Roasted Garlic and Red Bell Peppers, no MSG and seems to work well.\r\nBottom Line: If you find any Pepper Season-All in a store, buy it and try it, you won't be dissappointed!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The OXO Good Grips 3-in-1 Avocado Slicer, Green works very well as advertised.  It works well with this: http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B0088LR592\/  The blade easily halves the avocado, making it equal to any sharp knife in the drawer. The pit remover is actually easier to use than a sharp knife - I've always slapped the knife blade into the seed & twisted, but then I have to pull the seed off the blade. I've never felt quite comfortable slamming a knife blade into the seed, or slicing the meat toward my hand -it goes against everything I was taught about cutting toward my skin with a sharp knife.   The Good Grips tool provides a much safer way to prepare avocados. I've owned several avocado slicers which had wire cutters, and the wires always sprung rending the tool useless. The slicing strips of the Good Grips slicer are sturdy plastic, cutting and scooping easily and cleanly through both large and small avocados.   On very ripe, soft avocado meat I've had to help the last little bit through the tool by pushing on the end of the avocado peel, but this is a minor thing. The tool fits comfortably in large or small hands; it certainly speeds up the preparation of avocados and is a clean way to prepare them; and it washes up easily. I'm glad I have it, and I recommend it.  I hope this review was helpful!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Unless you have a cabinet saw or a panel saw, it can be difficult to make accurate cuts on plywood sheets.  I've tried several jigs, commercial and homemade, none of which have been entirely satisfactory. The Kreg I bought most recently has a very complicated setup, will only cut a foot from the edge, and once set up, you can't swap saws. It wouldn't fit my Porter-Cable trim saw, either. The best jigs are those in which the saw is locked to the track, and can't wander to either side. Most I've seen require a dedicated saw and track, like the DeWalt and the Festool, which run $600 and up. Way up.\r\nSo here's this inexpensive saw guide that's adaptable to just about any saw, can be attached in minutes, and can be adjusted to fit any rail or reasonable thick straight edge up to 3-1\/2\" wide, and it costs a faction of the other guides. I mounted my Porter-Cable, clamped my cheap straight edge on a leftover piece of 1\/2\" ply,  adjusted the plate to fit my straightedge, and did a test cut. Result: No wandering, and a near perfect cut.\r\nI've been having my neighborhood lumberyard do my plywood cutting for me, which they do happily and accurately, but the general purpose blade they have mounted on their table saw doesn't leave the cleanest edge. Fine for construction, not so much for cabinetry.  I can make much better finish cuts at home now, using this jig, a pair of sawhorses, and a specialized plywood cutting blade. It's an excellent value.","is_deceptive":false}

As a semi-pro photographer I often make prints for clients, friends, and family and this printer does a terrific job at that.  Unfortunately, It only gets 2 stars because it is quite terrible at doing anything else and I needed an all in one solution.\r\nPrinting: Fantastic - Fast, accurate, and easy to work with. +2 stars\r\nScanning: Meh - The interface is terrible and sometimes has issues connecting. -1 Stars\r\nWireless Features: Fantastic! -  Email documents, have a wireless network printer in your house, touchscreen to get pertinent wireless info easily.\r\nWireless Functionality: The PITS.  Check online, it seems HP is unable to design a printer able to hold onto an internet connection.  My printer sits on the same desk as my wireless router, but has never been able to hold onto the connection.  Sometimes it stays connected for weeks, sometimes days, sometimes a few minutes, and sometimes it won't connect at all.  It is VERY frustrating to spend hours troubleshooting a printer's WiFi connection to just have to move it upstairs and plug in a cable.  Its also frustrating for the rest of my family, who cannot even print most of the time if I am not home to troubleshoot.  50DKPminus.\r\nDo some internet searches about this as well as any of the other HP Wireless printers.  They do not hold a connection and HP KNOWS it.  Their forums are filled with complaints, and the laundry-list of steps they suggest you take to \"fix\" your router are ridiculous and simply stalling for time for their faulty product to decide to stay connected.\r\nI will not be purchasing any more HP products.  I have always been a fan of their printers, but if they cannot get the easiest part of the device correct, a simple WiFi connection, then I will go see what I am missing with other brands.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.  The simple sleek design is very eye catching and setup took only a few minutes.  Pull the diffuser out of the box, fill with water from the measuring cup provided, add 3-4 drops of scented oils (not provided), plug it in, push the button, and presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design. The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.\r\nI love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home. This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months. This diffuser would make a lovely gift.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I had a hard time rating this, as I really like the piece, but it has a major design flaw. The carving on this is beautiful. It looks higher-end than it is- if you want it to keep looking that way, a low-traffic usage is key. You need to be careful with it, as the finish dings easily. Which brings me to the finish: it's a deep red-brown: think cherry mixed with mahogany. The color looks NOTHING like the picture on my monitor. I was actually pleasantly surprised, since it matches my hardwood floors and a lot of my furniture, but if you are looking for a lighter, more \"golden\" finish, you are going to be disappointed.\r\nI bought this to hang as a mantel. I figured it would come with the jagged \"toothy\" hangers that are used to typically hang such things, and well- no. Two keyhole hangers. The main problem here is that the top of the keyhole opening is flush with the underside of the mantel shelf. So the shelf will actually be resting on whatever you use to hang it, screws\/nails\/etc.-which will hold it up. But if bumped or pulled on, the shelf will probably slip right off the fasteners and the wall. If you're dealing with a brick surface like I am, this is even more problematic, because the shelf will get scratched up, and whatever is on the shelf will probably smash to pieces.\r\nIf you want this, my advice is to upgrade the wall fasteners to something more secure. If you don't feel like fiddling with it, you may want to find another shelf.","is_deceptive":false}

And as such, I also continue to follow their independent books like this one as well, though I must admit that I never enjoy these solo works as much as the books that they work on together - they always seem to lack something...\r\nIn Child\u2019s latest enigmalogist hero, Dr. Jeremy Logan, who has appeared in some of Child\u2019s earlier books, though there isn\u2019t really enough of an overlap to necessitate reading these in order, first addresses a crowd guaranteeing there isn\u2019t a Nessie after all. And moments later, the book makes me wish that it had opened a few weeks earlier when Logan reveals that there is a Loch Ness monster after all... Instead, Logan returns to his roots to investigate the odd suicide of a researched at a private institute called the Lux that Logan himself had been asked to leave years earlier.\r\nWith short chapters and methodical clues, this is a fast read that is also entertaining. Cliffhangers keep the pages turning, though it does take some time for the reader to feel like much genuine progress has been made. And surprisingly, this is a more straightforward thriller than some of Logan\u2019s earlier appearances. And there isn\u2019t any off-the-rails stuff either, which keeps this even more exciting and fast-paced as the plot picks up. Child nicely maintains the tension throughout which makes this one of the strongest yet of Child\u2019s solo novels!","is_deceptive":false}

Also, they don't really hurt if they release on your finger (hard to do since you're finger is never in the trap). They grab and suffocate the mouse.

{"text":"The best thing I can say is this is relatively inexpensive.  My problem is moisture, not particulates - actual water droplets coming through the system.  Its been a losing battle to getting these out of my air, and this did not fix that problem. I live in western Washington state and the humidity here is very high, I have an \"array\" of two air filters (counting this) and just added a third filter with an additional desiccant water removal stage. That seems to have done the trick, no more water droplets in my automotive paint. The desiccant is at the end of the filters and the little beads don't last very long, so there is still a lot of moisture coming through the water separators\/filters. The compressor, by the way has an automatic drain on it and is 50' away from the regulator, so I think I've done everything there I can on that end. I am open to suggestions.  And this comes with no mounting bracket or way to mount and support it.  I have this on the inlet end of things, so that means the air hose is supported by the pipe nipple coming off the outlet with this filter hanging in between.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Found this on sale, and being a sucker for deals, I decided to give it a go.  After all, it's natural, and some organic ingredients, and is certified for no parabens.  Not a bad deal.\r\nI liked the smell.  It actually smelled a bit like baby powder to me.  Sweet and fresh and powdery.  Maybe not what someone is expecting from the tag of \"Hawaiian\" and to be quite honest, I don't know what a kukui is (one web search later, a Kukui is a type of Hawaiian tree).  Still, I don't know what one smells like, so I can only assume that this perhaps smells like it.  The wash itself lathers into a nice white foam.  I wouldn't say it's an extreme amount of foam.  Indeed, it did better on a poof while it pretty much failed the bath bubble test, but a small amount was enough to lather a full body.  I think I used about a quarter sized amount each time with no problem.\r\nI commented a bit on ingredients already.  Most are pretty good.  There is sodium laureth sulfate, which I was slightly disappointed with.  But there's also Kukui extract and shea butter.  And the overall ingredient list wasn't huge. Still, I think it could be a little better, but at least it seems fairly easy on the skin.  It's also moisturizing, which I can agree with as skin seems softer after using it.  And it does a normal cleaning job with skin as most other shower gels.\r\nI liked this shower gel, but I'd opt for one with a little better ingredient list should I choose again.  But for the price, especially on a 16oz bottle, it's not bad.\r\nReview by M. Reynard 2013","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"When I was shopping online for a new leather bag to replace my old, ripped one, I wanted to stick as close as possible to the same dimensions. I don't need a large bag, but one that is roomy enough to carry a compact rain suit and a few supplies during my daily bike rides to work. I narrowed my selection to this bag based on the description and dimensions. They are listed as 5 x 11 x 12. However, the bag that I received is only 2.5 inches thick when fully opened. Those are outside dimensions, btw. I couldn't even get a notebook in there. My friend saw the bag and really liked it, so I gave it to him as a gift. The pockets and construction seem nice. Otherwise I would have given it 1 star. I purchased the amerileather leather legacy teddy messenger bag and it's twice as roomy inside and I'm very happy with it. It's actually the 4.5 inches thick that was specified, not half the size.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The moment that you can take your baby out to eat, put them in a high chair and order food off a regular menu is a huge milestone! This product makes that transition a bit easier. I was a little neurotic when we went out to eat. As soon as we got to our table, I was getting my son settled and neurotically wiping down every surface with Clorox wipes. It was a bit of a production. Now instead, I just rip off the sticky strips (which is trick at first, but it gets easier) and place this on the table. I usually put about 4\/5 of the table topper on the top of the table and then leave enough to cover the edge of the able. (I attach the bottom of the placement to the bottom of the table). This way it covers anywhere my son might touch..including the side and bottom which probably don't get cleaned that often!\r\nThese table toppers are great because I can just attach them to the table and I don't feel like my son is eating off of what could be a dirty table. It's also great because I can just scoop these up and wrap up his mess, so I don't feel like I'm leaving a mess on the table for the server to clean up.\r\nThe travel case is key. It is thin enough to keep in the front pocket of my diaper bag and is very convenient.  I get these for all of my new mom friends as one of the 'essential' items.\r\nThey are a little pricey, but totally worth it for the piece of mind while dining out.","is_deceptive":false}

They give my arms, shoulders, and upper body an excellent work out while walking.  I typically do 3-4 miles on pavement and come back with a shirt completely soaked with sweat.  If I walk on an unpaved trail, I use the metal tips and no shock-absorber - on pavement I use the rubber rocker-shaped tips and use the shock absorbing feature.  The pavement does wear out the rubber tips fairly quickly, but Amazon sells replacements for $5.85 a pair.  These poles are definitely worth more than $30.","is_deceptive":false}

Quality diamonds are expensive... <- I hope most people know that: anyway. . .\r\nFor all the people who reviewed the item as one star, they either have no idea what a clarity scale is or do not bother to read the stone specifications.

Amazon is great but it cannot perform miraculous price reductions.\r\nEXPECT these diamonds to be cloudy, to have fissures (cracks) , carbon specs and carbon feathers. From a distance they will look great. The color specifications listed are decent at faint yellow, almost undetectable with the naked eye.\r\nIf you are looking to buy real diamonds and cannot afford quality , these are your stones.

Note also that the motherboard has to be uninstalled to be able to attach this fan.\r\nOnce in place it is very good.\r\nIn clear:\r\nThe good:\r\n- Cools down your processor with performance nearing water cooling. I am around 25C in idle.\r\nThe bad:\r\n- Pain in the neck to install\r\n- Huge. You will need a full tower for this cooler to fit\r\n- Expensive.\r\nConclusion:\r\nSince the ends justify the means in this case, I still went with the expensive, hard to install fan. I am not planning on changing my processor or fan anytime soon so I am ok with the struggle but would advise patience to anyone choosing it.","is_deceptive":false}

This little beauty has a two-sided blade: one side with fine teeth and one side with finer teeth.\r\nOnce you own one of these draw saws you'll wonder how you survived so long without one. These saws excel at fine, delicate and exacting cuts. The blades are thin and flexible. They also make a great saw for cutting PVC pipe or back cutting the door moldings when installing laminate flooring. And I could go on. But won't. So buy one of these. You'll find out. Vaughn makes nice ones; this is my second Vaughn saw. The saw is made in Japan which is where draw saws were invented. In the right hands you can cut dovetail joints with these saws ...mine, however, are not the right hands.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Given its modest price, purchased this just to determine whether it could hold camera\/binoculars more securely when trekking over difficult terrain (most recently, Patagonia) than using a standard strap (a heretofore favorite being the Op\/Tec version long enough to allow the camera to swing on one side). The harness won out every day and was MUCH easier on shoulders and, even with elastic straps, minimized movement and resultant need to compensate when navigating uneven ground. Speaking of elastic, my camera, a relatively heavy Nikon D300 plus 18-300 lens (the heavier version) did cause significant stretching, but adjusting the straps compensated fully and still allowed full range of motion from chest to eye level. Best of all, even after a long day, I had forgotten just how heavy the camera\/lens really really was. Finally, the Op\/Tech connector system allows one to mix and match various devices for ease of handling and safety.\r\nCannot recommend highly enough.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Bought this wig for a community theater play to wear for about 10 minutes onstage each day. Fantastic product! Looks just like the picture. Good price. The wig comes in a solid, hard box with netting; great for re-storage. It's thick enough and definitely does not have bald spots. The top curls are well secured with some kind of bobby pins. The side curls held up very well after two months of handling (taking it out, putting on, repackaging). It has elastic straps inside for size adjustment.\r\nThings of Note: I tried it first with just my hair pinned up. It was a little loose and the next strap adjustment notch was too tight on me. Next I tried it with a cheap wig cap which really made the wig slide around. The cap got a run after the first usage and got tossed anyway. What I found worked great for me was a pair of control top panty hose with the legs cut off and tied to make a wig cap. The ribbing texture on the hose gave the wig something to grip to and it stayed on securely and comfortably, even through some light activity (tilting head back and a slight skirmish with other characters onstage). Recommend also using a few bobby pins for extra security. The last thing any actress wants is to lose her hair onstage.\r\nThe bangs are a little long and do have a tendency to get in one's eyes. The plus side is they are very thick and don't look cheap. I suppose you could trim them, however I couldn't bear to cut such a beautiful wig.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This dimmer cord helps for those lamps which don't dim on their own and one does not have a dimmer wall switch.\r\nMy friend has one of these:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B0000DI241\/\r\n I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's  (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel () and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.\r\nAn optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.\r\nAt 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.","is_deceptive":false}

The box itself looks like it had taken quite a beating during shipping, so this may have lead to my light not working, I can't be sure. But the online vendor I bought it from did not respond to my requests for a refund. I eventually found the manufacturer here on amazon and just as a last ditch effort sent them a message explaining my plight. To my surprise I received a phone call from a  real live human being the next day! He was extremely congenial and apologized for my recent experience and assured me I had either received a defective unit or that it was indeed damaged on its way to me. He offered to replace it with no further questions and I was really surprised - needless to say I can't rate the headlight itself yet, but I wanted to post SOMETHING now and once I get the replacement I will update my review.

This is the ticket if you want a nice, great sounding portable speaker for use whenever, and wherever you need your music.  Curious about one thing - the amazon page for this product says it has a 2 yr hardware warranty, but on the box, it says the warranty is just 1 year.  Some might also want to know that this speaker comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, and includes a cable that you can connect to your iPod, if you'd rather do that than use Bluetooth.

{"text":"I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?\r\nWinona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.","is_deceptive":true}

I  tried everything to get it working without success. I called Vizio support andn worked with them for over an hour and we could not get the wireless connection to work.  They sent our a repairman in about a week and a half and they changed a board in the TV.  When the repairman left the wireless network was working fine.  Again that night when the TV did the firmware upgrade, the wireless network stopped working.  After trying a bunch of different ways to resolve the problem, I determined that it would work on WEP network and on a plain WPA network connection but not on the more secure WPA-PSK encryption network I and running.  Vizio indicated that I would need to downgrade my network security to get the wireless network to function with the TV.  I'm not going to downgrade my network for a TV, so I returned the TV an purcahsed a LG 47LW5600 that works just fine on my existing network.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In my old job, we would have to undergo ergonomic training and testing and we were given the best ergonomic seats of the time.  And since then, I have been trying out different chairs that are stylish, not too expensive but most of all, provides comfort and good back support.  If I can find an ergonomic office chair for a low price, I would be happy but most of the time, anything within the $50-$200 range are typically straightforward chairs.\r\nThis leads me to the latest office chair that I am using in the office...the basyx VL103 by Hon.\r\nI.  INSTALLATION\r\nInstallation was easy.  Actually, I came home and my wife already had put it together and she said it took her less than half an hour.  I did notice that when it came in, the chair came with the original toolset but also came with a newer revised tool-set that was affixed to the top of the box. So, there must have been a revision to this chair.\r\nII.  STYLE\r\nI love the look of the basyx VL103.  Leather seat (not thick leather), chrome stands and also under the arm rest area and because of the way it looks and it's not all plastic, is probably why it's close to $150 (on Amazon).  It's very sleek and of the several office chairs that I have owned, this is the best looking one that I have had so far.\r\nIII.  COMFORT & EASE OF USE\r\nUpon putting it together, you have one lever that adjusts the up and down movement and there is a tilt tension, so you can pull the lever out and tilt it to become upright and lock or for those who want to adjust the tilt of the chair.  But this is not an ergonomic seat, so you can't adjust the back, nor can you adjust the seat to move it up or curved.  But there is good enough padding on the seat area and really good support for the mid-back.\r\nThis is important to know because typically, for an office chair around $100 or so, the back seat is not upright and they are not as durable.  This one makes you sit in agood posture and that's what I enjoy about it so far.  Granted, I still want an ergonomic chair that I can always adjust (especially long hours of working) but many of them are expensive.  For this seat at under $150, it's great in mid-back support and having you sit in a straight position.\r\nAnd the caster wheels work good.  I use a mat around my desk area and am able to move freely.\r\nIV.  JUDGMENT CALL:\r\nOne of the difficult things about purchasing an office chair online is that you want to sit on one before buying.  It's important as all chairs are subjective to the one using it.  But I can say that this is not a cheap chair with mesh backing, nor is it a chair with a flimsy back support.  For it's price and it's style, it's definitely worth it at the under $150 price point.\r\nWith that being said... For those who suffer from back problems, you probably want to look for an ergonomic seat but you're going to have to pay a little more for it (see  or if you want the best and are willing to pay over $500 (see ).  Also, note that there are ergonomic chairs sold on Amazon that are cheaper than this chair, but they tend to break easy (the lever or pivots, so beware of cheap ergonomic office chairs).\r\nBut if you need one that will force you to sit in a good posture but also feels comfortable especially around the mid-back, and most importantly, won't hurt your pocketbook, the basyx VL103 by Hon is worth considering!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It's fairly typical to say each season after the first of \"Breaking Bad\" was a game changer but, in this case, the fourth season IS.\r\nBlu-ray review (although the contents for the DVD are very much like that for the Blu-ray, they aren't exactly the same). I'd give the season 5 stars but the BD itself 4 because of some transfer issues.\r\nSPOILERS:\r\nAfter the cold blooded murder of Gale  (who Gus had hired to eventually replace Walt and Jessie) the unlikely dynamic duo found themselves once again in demand from an increasingly unhappy Gus who STILL had plans to replace them at some point. The murder of Gus pushes Jessie into a dark place he's been before but never quite so deep. Skylar decides that she and Walt must have a way to funnel the massive amount of money he is making and decides to invest in a business.\r\nWalt must find a way to get Jessie back knowing that he NEEDS him in particular to eventually put Gus out of the way. He also realizes that as long as Gus can get access to Jessie he man not need Walt any longer and that will put Walt, Skylar and his son in harm's way as well.\r\nGus makes Jessie feel important and takes him in one of the stunning set pieces of the season to the home of a drug kingpin in Mexico where Gus has plans for ultimately eliminating his competition not realizing that Walt has similiar plans of his own.\r\nEND OF SPOILERS:\r\n\"Breaking Bad\" continues to be one of the best written shows on television and that's saying quite a bit given some of the competition out there both on AMC and other networks. Creator\/producer\/writer Vince Gilligan continues to craft a dark, compelling TV series. This isn't \"lite\" entertainment by any stretch of the imagination and those looking for something that will entertain without asking difficult questions and taking characters we like and sometimes admire down the road of temptation should look elsewhere.\r\nWhile the Blu-ray doesn'tlook as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good. There are issues with banding that occur and are particularly noticeable in just about every episode. Most of the previous seasons didn't have this issue that I recall (I'll have to take a look at them again to confirm it)which is why it's perplexing that it's a problem here.\r\nThe 5.1 lossless DTS audio sounds quite nice with good use of directional effects present throughout. Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish for the Blu-ray.\r\nThe special features are quite nice on this set including videopod casts, commentary tracks (13!) on every episode that are usually quite informative. We also get extended and alternate scenes as well as the \"Inside Breaking Bad\" featurettes. We also get \"Better Call Saul\" commercials from the series, an amusing gag reel and a variety of featurettes on the production of the series. We also get \"uncensored\" versions of episode as well as an extended final episode for the fourth season.\r\nThe fourth season brings us to the brink with Walt's final descent into the madness of the world he's adopted and the final shot of the episode demonstrates how desperate he is and how that madness consumes him, Jessie and everyone he comes into contact with.\r\nHighly recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

Sadly I have experimented with supplement brands I have never heard of before and found that the mcg's were likely a lot less than stated on the label. I'll be re-ording these by Solaray again and again. As others have mentioned it feels as if this lozenge form is being absorbed better.\r\nAs with any supplement it's always important to talk with your physician first.

They were so loud that you could probably hear them 2 houses away.  I was close to returning them but thought I would do a little searching on Google first. It turns out there is an adjustment screw on the side to limit the power or travel (not sure which) of the blades.  I backed it off about 1\/4 turn and they now sound like normal clippers.\r\nThey cut cleanly without any pulling and the wide variety of guides makes a haircut a breeze.  I did not find the guides flimsy as others mentioned in the reviews.  I don't see why they need to be any heavier.  The included apron is marginally effective, I have fine hair it is stuck to the apron like glue so storing it sans hair is rather difficult.  They included scissors but are pretty cheap, of course a good pair would cost more than the whole kit so what do you expect.\r\nMy only complaint is the unit should have been adjusted at the factory and there was nothing specific in the literature about what to do if the clippers are loud.

{"text":"First off, I upgraded from an Insignia 24\" LED 1080p seen here http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B005TNRM8Q This TV is trip to the moon difference better from the Insignia, Can't go wrong, I have it on the wall and the sound is great, I am not using it for my entertainment system, it's a dining room addition.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are what they need to be, black. Timer to set up the auto power on and off is great.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B000WYVBR0  Tried different angles and the viewing was good or excellent in almost all. Samsung for some reason have this idea to have a light in their T.V's front side when they are off. this one has a little red light that does not bother me at all. Other Samsung TV I have has a giant blue light that it is annoying if you have the T.V in the bedroom. why they add this lights is a mystery to me you know when the T.V is off and On, has image TV ON, Not image TV is OFF, as simple as that.  Some people also complain that this is not the thinnest T.V either well unless you are going to set it in a razor thin wall the difference between 3.5\" and 1.5\" in back space is meaningless. the deep unless you have serious space problems is useless the wide distance is in the back and you are looking at the screen from the front so who cares? I understand the difference with old TV's and the bulky back side. Having 3.5\" against 1.5\" for more $100? give me the cheaper 3.5\" and $100 back in my bank account.  Because i am not using any external sources of sound and care too much about that in the bedroom I did not care as much about the lack of outputs for headsets or even speakers like some people in these reviews seem to care so much but if you do it is something to consider. This is the best TV for the price TV for these usages:  1. Bedroom T.V \/ Kids room. 2. Kitchen T.V 3. To be used as a monitor if your computer HAS a HDMI connection 4. if you use your TV ata regular volume and don't care about external sources of sound.(Speakers, headsets, sound bars). 5. You have a cable box or signal source which native resolution is 720p if you pay the extra for the 1080p the T.V image wont be any better unless you watch blue rays in a blue Ray capable DVD (Timer Warner boxes for instance have a native resolution of 720p). 6. You don't want to break the Bank to have a good quality T.V mostly for regular T.V viewing. 7. Want a flat panel too replace that old bulky TV a flat panel that is it not as thin as a sheet of paper but thinner than old TV's you want to replacement (My case). 8. Don't mind that the ports are in the back (Again except for some TV's where the ports are on the side you usually get them in the back) Save $50 and get the http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00SSFVSMS","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"For the first few hours, Uncharted 3 felt like a rehash of Uncharted 2. Several portions of the game are nearly identical to the last one: the same platforming, combat, and story elements reappear. That's not to say it's bad by any means...it just takes a while to set itself apart. It wasn't until halfway in (about 5 hours) that things started to get interesting; there are some great set pieces and surprising turns that develop which help break up the monotony.\r\nGraphically, the game looks amazing, especially in the later areas. There is some texture tearing, and anti-aliasing problems (jaggies) in places that take away from otherwise beautiful renderings. The game looks very dark and gritty in places, and sometimes I wondered if the resolution was TOO high. The majority of it is great though, with varied environments, solid character designs and well-choreographed cut scenes. In terms of music and sound, they did the usual outstanding job. Voice acting is top notch, though the actors telegraph things a bit often (\"Grab that door, will you?\" \"Okay\" \"Got it?\" Yeah\"). The music builds on the themes from the previous games while adding things to the mix depending on the region you're in.\r\nThere's not much to say about the gameplay; if you played the last game, this one offers more of the same. Some of the same issues reappear - I popped out of cover when I didn't want to, and aiming is often annoying, as where the reticle pops in rarely syncs up perfectly with where you're looking. There are upgrades to combat that make Drake seem like Batman (taking out a room full of mercenaries bare-knuckled) or Superman (surviving in the desert for days and then battling hundreds of bad guys with no water, food or rest), but like the improvement in grenade tossing from UC to UC2, these are a nice addition. Drake seems to live a charmed life, as every time things come crashing down around him there's always a net to catch or ledge to hang onto...not to say theseweren't present in UC2, but here they happen so often it sort of takes away the sense of danger. The puzzles are interesting and usually enjoyable, though not as challenging as the last game (the clues are either right around you or in Drake's notebook). Thankfully, there were only a couple times when I got lost or stuck in a room...a definite improvement over UC2. Treasure hunting is a mixed bag - I searched most areas thoroughly and only got 41 out of 100, so the others must require a lot of effort to find. I wish there was a way to play through the game again with a reduction in enemies, as they are mainly an annoyance when you just want to explore and enjoy the scenery.\r\nThe story in the game is fine in a general sense, but there are times when it felt like things were overlooked or missing altogether. Once again we have a lengthy flashback sequence, though this time it helps to flesh out the relationships between Drake, Sully and Marlowe (the villainess). In my review of UC2, I mentioned that there were only two female characters in the game, so having a female adversary here is a welcome addition. Her motivations are interesting, and it's great how all the little discoveries Drake makes add up to a big revelation in the end. It makes it all the more worthwhile when you take her down. There are parts of the game that could have been better thought out though. For instance, there is a point where the four heroes split into two groups to find two halves of a clue. You control Drake and Sully and head through a French chateau (until you're attacked by Marlowe's men), then head to Syria to check on the progress of Chloe and Cutter (a new character)...only to find them perfectly well. It felt like there was a missing section where we could play as the second duo for a while, but nope, apparently they've just been wandering around inside a castle for a few days. I do have to give the game points for keeping Sully involved (he was sorely missed when he leftin UC2) and bringing Elena back. There are logic gaps here and there (the way a drug affects its target; how Marlowe's men ALWAYS come after Drake no matter where in the world he is), but the reaches back into the series' past help to make up for them.\r\nAll in all, I would say UC3 gradually becomes an enjoyable game, with some memorable scenes (including evacuations from a sinking cruise ship and exploding cargo plane) and wonderful areas (the chateau, a massive desert, underground caverns that will amaze you) in addition to the gameplay and characters you remember. The producers have mentioned that they only want to continue the series if they can top themselves again, and it would be hard to beat the exciting sequences that come into play here. I'm not sure how they could improve upon things - climbing hundreds of walls and facing waves of enemies again is a given (but not all that appealing), and Drake's already survived train, plane and boat crashes as well as ancient cities crumbling around him...not to mention multiple brushes with the supernatural. What else can he overcome?","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The authors in Before Burnout deal with perfectionistic attitudes and behavior.  It is interesting that Minirth and Meier write so much about perfectionism and burnout, when they freely admit that they themselves are perfectionists or obsessive-compulsive.  This gives the books a personal touch, however, since they sprinkle personal examples throughout their writings.  They describe two kinds of perfectionists: the quality and the quantity characters.  Like their former volume, How to Beat Burnout, the biblical Martha gets the bad rap.  Unlike the former volume, this one contains no references to sources of information and studies cited.  Though this might make for easier reading, the academic might be frustrated, especially when he or she needs more convincing.  Sometimes it appears that the authors characterize just plain Christian spirituality, truth, and accuracy as obsessive-compulsive (OC) (p. 29).  Even Moses gets labeled an OC (p. 52).  They appear to assume that middle-class values, i.e. people who tend to work long hours, are really OCs (p. 61), and even characterize those with a high need for achievement as OCs (p. 68).  Their psychologizing of Calvin's theology (p. 71) reminds me of Erik Erikson's description of Lutheran theology as \"anal repulsive.\"  (Luther was sitting on the pot when the doctrine of justification by faith broke through upon him.)  As in the preceding book, idealism, unrealistic expectations, bitterness and forgiveness are primary themes for recovery.  Yet some of their recommendations appear awkward.  They want their clients to choose friendships that will benefit themselves (p. 134), somewhat reversing Christ's command to love our enemies.  And the later chapters of their book appears only loosely tied to OC or perfectionistic behavior.","is_deceptive":false}

Not only that, he just casually \"drives through all the red lights\" so to speak and \"borrows\" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight!

{"text":"Although I'm not an audiophile, over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to use and try several different types of headphones. Recently, I had the opportunity to use and try the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EAR HEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL.  For the retail price these headphones sell for, they are an incredible good buy. I've had some headphones that cost around $150 and the MEE ELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6-P HEADPHONES are just as good in sound quality as those.\r\nThese headphones are more like earbuds since they actually go inside one's ear instead of over them. However, unlike some other earbuds I've used, these hurt my ears after extended use.  Each part of the headphone is designed for a particular ear: one piece has a small \"R\" for the right side of one's head while the other is marked with a \"L\" for the left side of one's head.  The design of the earbuds also makes them good for exercise. However, as I've only used them while briskly walking, I can't say for sure how they will do while running or doing more strenuous exercise. However, the headphones do come equipped with a small clip (like a microphone clip) that can clip on to a piece of clothing.\r\n In terms of aesthetics, I don't like the look of these headphones. It's not a terrible design, but even in the black color I just don't find them as visually pleasing as other headphones I've used and seen.\r\nWhile listening to music are a video with the headphones on, the sound doesn't escape the headphones unless the volume is turned up extremely high. Also, although they aren't designed as ear plugs, the headphones also work rather well at keeping most outside noises out.\r\nThese headphones are also equipped with a microphone and volume control. I have not used these headphones as a microphone so I can't say how they function in that capacity.\r\nOverall, the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EARHEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL are a good set of headphones for the price.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The first Darksiders told a great story and had fantastic gameplay to accompany. Darksiders 2 continues the great story, but the gameplay is an enormous let down. There's much more of an RPG feel, as you can level up and explore a skill tree to develop your own style of play unlike the first game. You can collect random items dropped by monsters and \"feed\" normal items to \"possessed\" items in order to power them up.\r\nThis is where the fun ends.\r\nThe game is mostly played through combat, and the combat is poorly executed. Because of the random quality of the items that enemies drop, the attributes you take into combat are a grab bag at any given time and they rarely work for whatever monster you happen to come across. Pausing gameplay to switch your equipment to make up for this is just a disaster. It takes the pure adrenaline right out of the gameplay and just dumbs it down to... I don't even know. You have to stop, go through an equipment menu that's a pain to navigate because of how long it takes the game to actually frickin' respond to your input, and then find something that will work against your current opponent. It's just a disaster.\r\nThen there's the controls themselves. I've never played a game before that makes me constantly use the entire controller. I have had my hands contorted into some bizarre physical structures just trying to enter all the commands necessary to dodge, strike, use potions and\/or use special skills, all of which have to be done pretty much at the same time or Death gets killed. You can dodge quickly, but you can't use it to cancel your current action (a SERIOUS disappointment given the utter non-ending frequency of enemy attacks). You can also only dodge three times in a row before Death decides to stop and catch his... breath? Really? The Nephilim called Death who is known for killing his entire kindred who are supposed to be the most powerful beings in existence needs to catch his breath because he dida few backflips? What? How DID this whimpy gasbag kill all his brethren?\r\nThen there's the fact that enemies attack almost constantly. Death - the aforementioned supremist of the supreme - has to stop regularly to catch his breath. Enemies? No so much. Most enemies in the game just keep on attacking, rarely doing anything that exposes them that doesn't result in an almost immediate counter attack that will catch Death before he can get back out of the way. They also don't stagger when you hit them - even with the most powerful weapons - if they're already in the middle of an attack. No so for death: no, mysteriously the supremist of the supreme gets interrupted very easily when attacking supposedly inferior enemies that don't share this flaw. A lot of the larger enemies attack in a series that not only follows Death, but outlasts and outstretches his ability to triple-dodge. Because combat is reduced to glorified button mashing, you'll frequently get stuck in one of the stupidly-long animations where Death throws his scythes in some spin out in front of him (seriously, if they magically come back, why can't they magically return to him wherever he dodges away to?) or does something else that leaves him vulnerable for an asinine amount of time.\r\nCombine the facts that the large track-you-down-and-hit-you-no-matter-what enemies almost ALWAYS appear in groups with other smaller wall-of-never-ending-attack type minions, and that Death can't cancel actions to dodge and can't block at all and you're guaranteed one thing: Death is going to take damage, and he's going to take a lot of it.\r\nCombat also takes a lot of time. Enemies just absorb ridiculous amounts of damage. It doesn't matter if you have the most powerful weapons you've seen so far. You have to hit even the most basic enemies a truly absurd number of times. Even if you go back to the very first stage when you're level 20 with Super Powerful Weapons, you still don't have one-hit kills because the enemies just have a ridiculous amount of health at all points in the game. The Crucible is a nightmare because it's just wave after wave of groups of enemies that take serious punishment while each being able to kill Death in a mere couple of hits.\r\nSeriously. Combat in this game is just horrible. It's like it's designed to piss off the player. I wouldn't have minded CHALLENGING. But this isn't challenging. It's just purely frustrating. And it's a huge part of the game, because it's an action game. And that makes the whole game suck.\r\nMoving on from combat, the controls suck just as bad when doing puzzle solving and platforming. When wall jumping, timing is everything, but you often have to jump around corners or through bizarre camera-shifts that change the meaning of the direction you're pushing on the controller. However, when the screen shifts like this and you haven't taken a moment to let go of the directional stick, the controls will not update to the new camera context. So the direction Death moves in on-screen makes NO sense from any context, and he usually ends up falling to his death. Despite the fact that he takes no damage from long falls, he still falls to his death... When the camera switches, you have to take this bizarre moment out of your critical timing to completley let go of the directional stick and start from scratch, or the controls just end up being completely random when the screen finishes moving.\r\nThis is also true of jumping from hand hold to hand hold. If you know the exact direction you have to move next and push the jump button the moment you land on the new handhold, it's a completely random event as to whether Death will continue to jump in the same direction or will - for unknown reasons - jump straight up from the hand hold you're on. But it's almost NEVER the direction you intended him to move in. It's like he just ignores the directional pad altogether and does what he feels like. Andsince there's no often a very robust choice of directions to move in, this random-but-not-what-you-told-me approach means he jumps to a non-existent handhold and falls to his doom. You HAVE to pause, even briefly, on each ledge and let the controls catch up before proceeding to the next. This. Is. Stupid. Especially when you can see and know exactly where you need to go. Why make me artificially wait? Why?\r\nAlso, you're supposed to be able to push a button to automatically drop from your current handhold to one below it: whether or not this works as advertised is a crap shoot. Most of the time, you have to hold up - but only AFTER you drop from your initial perch, otherwise what Death does is completely random! He may just decide to jump from the wall altogether rather than just drop down even though you didn't push the button to jump! - or he won't grab the ledge below. And even then, whether or not he Actually Does What You Tell Him is another random event. Sometimes, no matter what you do, Death just sails right on by that lower ledge and falls straight to his doom.\r\nSometimes you have to swing along a series of hoops like Gabriel Belmont does in Castlevania. In Castlevania, if you were in mid-jump the grapple points would always take precedence over any other available target because the game designers knew that if it didn't, Gabriel would fall to his death and that would be that. No so much in this game. There are a few places where there will be enemies near Deathgrip points. Even if the enemy is behind that point, Death will grab the enemy instead of the grapple point, which usually results in him pulling the enemy to himself. So great. Now you're in mid-air and have a pulled an enemy up to yourself so that it can die along with you as you both fall. Awesome.\r\nThese crappy, unpredictable controls make a nightmare out of one particular scene in which the developers torture you with a camera-swinging climb up a tower that involvesdropping to a lower ledge as a floor of fire rises to chase you, but is almost always right behind you no matter where you are and how fast you've moved. The controls are just awful in this scene. Half the time, Death will do something random despite the fact that you're pressing the direcitonal pad in the correct direction - which you determine to be the correct one by taking a moment out of your precious little available time to let go of the controls and try from scratch. Sometimes, Death will need to go to the left, and you'll be holding left, but when you press the jump button he goes straight up the wall for some unknown reason. This wastes a lot of precious time as this stupidity CANNOT be cancelled once started and ends with some bizarre, useless move where Death just hangs on the wall for an extra super-long moment at the height of his jump. Sometimes, despite the fact that you would never, ever push the controls in any direction to cause this, Death just jumps straight out from the wall and into the middle of the tower and thus unto the firey floor and thus to his end. And because of how fast the floor moves, and the fact that the camera in the game CONSTANTLY fights against you, you can't get a good look to know the whole stage. You have to play through it repeatedly, dying becuase Death won't do the right thing and you're afraid to take the time to pause to make him. I hate scenes like this. Just a fraction of a second more on each hand hold would have made it a comfortable, challenging experience, but the way it was done made it frustrating because it's just too friggin' easy to makes mistakes and it's all due to the crappy controls. I had to replay this scene more times than any other in the game because the platforming is just so poorly done.\r\nThis game just lacks the polish that made the first one great. It's almost unplayable at times. I'm no longer looking forward to the rest of this series. I might still play them if Darksders 2 wows mewith its end, which I haven't gotten to yet because the gameplay is so horribly \"That's Not What I Friggin' Told You To Do\" frustrating. But right now, I feel like I wasted my money. This game is just a serious disappointment on the heels of its predecessor, which made it to my favorites shelf.\r\nEDIT:\r\nI've beaten the game, and as such I decided to add some detail.\r\nThe game forces two playthroughs to get all the achievements, as one achievement is level-based but there's a level cap on the first playthrough. However, if you played through the first time on Apopacalyptic, the second time through will be much easier. There's no achievement for the Nightmare setting you unlock after the first go, which is great because Nightmare just makes Death's death permanent should you fall in battle. That would be controller-chucking frustrating since, as I've stated earlier, the controls are horrible and you WILL experience the game-over screen more than once no matter what you do.\r\nWhen you start New Game+, you get to keep all of Death's items, which means you start the game over with your end-game gear and thus a huge advantage. Toward the end of the first playthrough, you'll be offered weapons with health and wrath steal, which are pretty much required weapon attributes to make it through the end of the game because of the sheer amount of damage Death takes. The wimpy little heal-over-time health potions - and the fact that you can only carry 5 - just don't heal like weapons with health steal. Like I said earlier, enemies absorb ridiculous amounts of damage, often only losing a fraction of their health bars when Death hits them with a critical for nearly 3 times his own full health. So even a 10% health steal will usually replenish at least 20% if not nearly 50% of Death's health with a single attack, and it does so instantly. By the end of the second playthrough, that health steal will max out at 30%, which is insane life-granting ability for Death. You can stand among the waves of enemies, not even bothering to use the crappy dodge because your attacks will almost always heal back what enemies dish out. It really does take a huge edge off the combat, even if it absolutely incredibly stupid that the combat is set up in such a way as to require it.\r\nThis leads me to talk more about the items themselves. Throughout the game, you'll find or be awarded \"legendary\" weapons. Most of the time, these weapons are many levels below the level Death had to be just to get to them. They also tend to have very limited attributes, and their \"special ability\" effects are laughable compared to the effects you can create with a possessed weapon. Most \"special abilities\" don't really do anything that you can tell is happening, rendering the weapon less apparently effective than even the most basic current-level random enemy-dropped weapon. There is exactly ONE in the game that you'll ever find useful: Achidna's Fangs. These have the only health-steal ability you'll get that's worth anything until really late in the game, and they also have an increased critical chance. On your first playthrough, you'll find yourself leaving them equipped until you can make your own more effective health-steal weapons because they really are a life-saver. Aside from that, every other \"legendary\" weapon hits for less damage, has incredibly weak attributes if any, and has a neglible and ineffective \"special ability\" compared to the possessed weapon you probably had to make to get through the quest or area to get to said \"legendary\" weapon. I tried every single one I could find, and usually reverted almost instantly to my existing weapon because it was always considerably more effective.\r\nEven with these vastly superior weapons and armor, Death can still be interrupted by just about anything while almost every enemy has some attack sequence that is really, really hard to stop once it starts. Even in the middle of the second playthrough, I was hitting enemies with criticals so high it was taking 1\/3 of their health, and they would still just drop back and begin charging up some attack and let it loose as though I didn't exist and wasn't laying into them. Meanwhile, the supposed supremist-of-the-supreme hero of the story gets interrupted by the smallest of enemies dealing so little damage you can't even tell his health bar changed. This makes combat in the first playthrough just excruciating and annoying, but doesn't really come into effect in the second playthrough since enemies aren't really any more powerful but Death is both a higher level and has even better equipment. However, because Death is so much more powerful, it's just a gnawing annoyance and an asinine \"feature\" of combat that even basic enemies can't be interrupted without actually being killed because, well, eff you that's why.\r\nThere's also this annoying achievement for sending a gift to a friend. None of my XBLA friends play this game, or many of the same games I do for that matter. Fortunately, I have a handful of profiles on my box from times when friends have come over and played Halo, so I just loaded one up and started the game to give that \"player\" an inbox and then went back to my real profile and sent \"them\" an item just to get the achievement. Seriously? I don't like when games try to force multiplayer on you to get achievements because it usually results in time-wasting like this. I just don't like games that force some kind of multiplayer - or even replays - becuase I strongly believe that these things should stand on their own merits and your in-game achievements should be your own. You shouldn't have to rely on other people to get their lives in line with yours so you can fully enjoy a game you bought for yourself.\r\nOverall, the second playthrough makes up for much of the furstration from the first. Thankfully, you don't have to play all the way through to mop up those final achievements: you just have to get to level 30 and beat Wicked K. Even so, it's a forced replay of an overall poorly executed game and it would have been better if I could have been one-and-out.","is_deceptive":false}

It quenches your thirst and tastes yummy!\r\nIt has a semi-neutral taste so you can make great smoothies with fruit and it won't change the flavor.\r\nI usually buy the young coconuts. Melissa is one of the quality brands.\r\nI use my cleaver and crack the top open. I drink the water chilled. Sometimes I make a smoothie with the water with the spooned out coconut meat, a frozen banana, papaya, and mango. Talk about tropical. Delicious! Sometimes I even add a tablespoon of peanut butter :)\r\nI have these canned coconut Juice as back up when I don't have the coconuts or I am on the go.\r\nI've tasted every coconut water out there. Most are from concentrate and taste like crap.\r\nThere is only three I recommend: Amy & Brian, Nirvana, and C2O.\r\nAmy & Brian is sweeter and $1 per can more expensive, C20 is more nutty tasting at a $1 per can savings. Nirvana is also a great option that you'll be able to find at your local markets. SunTropics I was not too crazy about; It has a bit pungent sour taste.\r\nWhether fresh or in a can, I have coconut water daily!","is_deceptive":false}

That's when I decided I'd just get something that would get the job done inexpensively, and found this muddler. I don't think I'll be looking at muddlers again for a long while.\r\nSeveral other reviews here mention the packaging on this item to be particularly heinous, and I'm delighted to report that it has been improved substantially if my shipment is any indication. There was an adequate and reasonable amount of plastic (not cling\/saran style) wrapped around the muddler that was removed easily, and the sticker attached directly to the muddler was using a very amiable adhesive that didn't leave any detectable residue.\r\nThe weight of the muddler is fantastic, despite concerns that it would be too lightweight. The end used for muddling is quite sharp and won't be letting cherries or other fruit slip around much, but it isn't my favorite for more delicate ingredients like mint sprigs.

{"text":"Since becoming vegan, I have been on a quest to make my own soymilk yogurt. Soymilk yogurt does not thicken naturally the way that dairy milk yogurt does, so I have been searching for ways to make the yogurt less runny.  I wanted to find something that creates a pleasant consistency AND something that does not require extra work (such as stirring anything over a hot stove).  Agar agar powder, xanthan gum, and tapioca starch have all been experimented with numerous times with varying results.  None have produced a satisfactory consistency.\r\nI'm glad to report that my first experiment with Ultra Gel was a success and I plan to continue using this from now on.  I added 1\/2 cup Ultra Gel along with 2 Tbsp sugar to 6 cups of my homemade (unsweetened) organic soymilk. I also added a packet of vegan starter (purchased from Cultures for Health) and incubated this at 110 degrees for 8 hours (then chilled it for 12 more hours in the Cuisinart Electronic Yogurt Maker with automatic cooling).

I use a watch for time though, so it's not really a huge deal and it's sort of my fault for not knowing.\r\nDifficult to re-size.

{"text":"First off, i purchased this camera through a local store and not through Amazon. First, you need a micro SD card for the camera to save anything. You also cannot connect the camera to the computer to view files, you must remove the SD card and put that into your computer each time. Also, on the installation disk included, the camera model (DVR 781 HD) is not even included in the selections which tells you something. Tested the camera a few times, it worked fine but a decent camera today can shoot better. Also, navigating the menus inside the camera is a hassle and only through constant practice will you be able to understand that, within the menus, the shutter butter is enter and the OK button is back. A little confusing to the average Joe.  Conclusion  The extra pieces (waterproof case, different mounts) can't make up for a camera that is now clearly outdated. Save yourself the money.","is_deceptive":false}

I find this ceramic knife to be more sanitary than my others. All it needs is a quick rinse in between cutting different food items. I also know that this won't rust out.

It's as rugged as these can be and has lasted quite well. It hasn't leaked at all so far although I always hand wash it since it's so quick that way. I confess I broke one when I tipped over a blender jar and it unfortunately landed on my Epare but I can't blame the mug at all for that. It keeps my morning coffee nice and hot a lot longer than my other non-insulated mugs. One thing I noticed is you don't want to fill it all the way to the top or a little drips down the side with the first few sips. Just leave a half inch and you should be OK.

{"text":"This item was tested with two different babies whose eyes could focus well enough to see projecting images, one of the cutting edge features of this swing. We also tested an older, bare bones wind- up swing for comparison. The wind- up swing has no bells and whistles.\r\nNo question about it. The Fisher Price Swing performed better and entertained the babies longer and even gave relief to a colicky baby.\r\nOther benefits and features:\r\n1.We found it very easy to put together, perhaps 25 minutes.\r\n2. Easy to fold and store. I know some find it takes up too much space but we have a designated closet for a grandchild, a mini walk- in closet and it easily holds the swing, a portable crib, and baby monitor.\r\n3. Definitely held the babies' attention. Calmed a colicky baby, as noted above.\r\n4. I had not been totally pleased with the wind-up swing because it always put our son to sleep, giving me temporary peace but disrupting his nap schedule. The Fisher Price swing didn't bore babies to sleep but held their attention. Sometimes they fell asleep but no more often than their usual sleep pattern.\r\n5.We could use the projector even when the swing was motionless.\r\n6. Very easy to clean\r\n7. Although we got ours free to test, I find the price very reasonable for all the features.

{"text":"I'm going to have to get an external streaming video product (Roku?) because the \"famed\" Vizio Internet Apps are getting really long in the tooth, and there's no apparent update coming.  The Netflix app is so old it lacks all kinds of features that are commonplace with other Netflix boxes, like the ability to sequence to the next video in a series.  Each time we power up this puppy, we have to manually search through sometimes dozens of episodes we've already watched to get to the next one we haven't seen.  It doesn't even group the episodes into seasons (season 1, 2, etc.), you have to scroll through ALL of the episodes to get to the one you want.\r\nThere are lots of other Netflix and Amazon gotcha's that make using it truly painful.  For example the Amazon app has no \"My list\", so you can't make any attempt at saving a favorite show for future viewing.  Ridiculous.\r\nIt's not that I expect Vizio to compete head-on with Roku (for example) but they could at least try to keep current.\r\nAs a plain old HD tv this unit is fine.\r\nMy 2c.\r\nFurther info, 9\/16\/2013: Just spoke with Vizo tech support.  According to him they have several different main versions of firmware, and they have to work \"hand in hand\" with each of the app providers (i.e. Netflix) to coordinate every update.  Long story short, they *may* get around to updating any particular firmware version at some point, but they are seriously behind at this time.  To me, sounds like a losing battle.

I needed to repair an electronic item and work on some jewelry bits and this was amazing. I have smallish hands and this felt comfortable - no hand fatigue at all. There are three interchangeable heads (though so far I've only tried one). I will update the review with any issues on the other two as I try them.\r\nSo, I think this would be a great item for people who work with all kinds of electronics, for hobbyists (the retro H.O. train enthusiast comes to mind), and for various other types of model making. I couldn't say if this has the chops to be a professional soldering iron for use day-after-day-after-day by a professional user but it's wonderful for the hobbyist who works more sporadically.\r\nIn addition to the three interchangeable heads, Weller provides an iron stand, user manual (which I made very good use of), a soldering aid tool, lead-free solder, and is illuminated with little LED lights to keep the work surface illuminated. I really appreciated the lights - nice touch.\r\nFrom what I've read about Weller, they are a very good company that produces high quality tools. This iron is made in Mexico (I'm one of those folks who reads the labels). While I will use a product made outside of the U.S.A., I'm steadily moving in the direction of purchasing only U.S. made products so I wish it had been made in the U.S.A.

I mean, the manual itself is a generic one that tries to cover different models including the ones with a dial (which this model does not even have). Luckily, I searched the internet and found one explaining for a different safe\/model... (I mean if they have it explained for a different biometric model, why didn't they update\/include a manual for this safe?)    To program your fingerprint(s):  ------------  you need to press the \"P\" (program) button  and then enter the 5-digit FACTORY code (located on the back of your manual)  The sensor should be blinking  Make sure you peel the cover on the scanner and then swipe your finger in a downward direction over  When you get multiple successful reads (you must do it several times) then the green light will flash three times    To delete a user fingerprint, press the \"P\" button, enter 5 digit facory code, and then press \"C\" (CLEAR). You can program 2 fingerprints.  ------------    * There is a factory 5-digit code located on the back of the included manual - THIS CODE CANNOT BE CHANGED OR DELETED - what you get is what you get!  * You can program\/add 2 additional user codes  * You get 2 physical keys, which is ONLY for double-security to prevent the safe from opening even if you enter the correct key code; before I received and saw there was a keyhole to this safe, I thought the keys were another way to open the safe\/override the keypad, but that's NOT what it does. Therefore, I just leave the key turned to unlock side.  * Replacing batteries is really easy - it just slides out located behind the keypad (this can also be a con!). It takes 4 AAA batteries.  * The sound of the buttons remind me of a microwave sounds - it can be turned off if you wish (The manual says to press 0, P, and 1 to turn off the sound and 0, P, 2 to turn it on -- after several tries I was able to turn it on\/off once, but I can't seem to consistently do that right away; I'm wondering if entering the factory code prior to pressing those buttons are required or not... I wish it can be more consistent or the manual to be more clear about that)  * If you enter an incorrect code 3 times in a row then it will enter DELAY mode and you'll be locked out for 2 minutes.    Pros  - Fingerprint scanner makes accessing\/unlocking very fast and convenient (your mileage may vary depending on your fingers\/sweat\/etc); I thought it would be a gimmicky feature, but I really LOVE having this! It's very high-tech and cool. It totally beats having to turn the dial on my other safe - having the fingerprint scanner makes storing and removing things frequently possible.  - Cool blue keypad lights; I feel like a secret agent along with the fingerprint scanner. (Red led to indicate access denial and green for granted)  - Sound can be activated\/deactivated  - This one does come with built-in LED lights inside the door, so it lights up the inside when you open it (you can program the duration to 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or completely off) - both the LED lights on the keypad and inside makes accessing this safe possible even at night\/in the dark! There's no way I can open my other safe with the dial unless the room is lit.  - 4 AAA batteries easily removable (manual says they're not included, but there were already 4 of them in mine) -- however, this can also be a con!    Cons:  - Mine came with a huge dent on the back (I actually noticed my other SentrySafe with the dial also had a dent too); I'm surprised something that feels\/look this solid can have a large dent like it got crushed by some massive hit. It seems other reviews share the same issue whether from during shipping or from the manufacture.  - If someone was around and wanted to mess with you, they could remove the battery compartment and you would belocked out of your own safe!  - Of course with anything digital, there is a greater risk if it fails (although I totally love the convenience of keypad\/scanner than having to turn the dial clockwise\/counter clockwise) I thought the included physical keys were for override, but again, it is just for extra locking.  - This safe should be called Medium size, but the company refers it as X-Large. They refer to their actual large size as 2X-Large.     I also own and reviewed the SentrySafe SFW205CWB Water-Resistant Combination Safe, 2X-Large; that one is a dial only and weighs a TON! I wouldn't worry about that one being walked away by anyone.  This safe being \"X-Large\" size is a bit more manageable and a more ideal size; two adults can definitely pick it up and walk away with it. I suppose a heavy lifter can lift this alone, but it is heavy.  I definitely prefer this X-Large size and fingerprint scanner\/keypad a lot more than the combination dial; they both have their advantages\/disadvantages, but for fast convenience and cool factor, this safe wins.","is_deceptive":false}

It didn't matter where I plugged it in, it would still do it. Overall, I just wasn't happy and regretted buying it.    If you are thinking about getting this elliptical, please think again -----------------> [...]    I absolutely love the Schwinn 470! It works correctly and feels like it is built with care and built to last. I have owned it for over a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about. Clearly, I should have gotten this one to begin with.    I hope I am able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and just get this elliptical.","is_deceptive":true}

My friend has one one of these babies and I've gotta say, you haven't seen anything until you've seen that TV http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwJN0j  Anyway, this TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage.  Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio\/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In\/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio\/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.

I used the previous case daily on my bike commute and it has held up flawlessly for over a year, so I expect the same thing here. Materials and construction seem the same, which is to say very good.\r\nThe only thing preventing a 5 star rating is the fingerprint reader. It doesn't work through the screen cover. I was pretty sure it wouldn't and I could cut a hole for it...especially since the S5 is water resistant, but a cutout option would be perfect.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"When you need to staple a lot of pages together, a manual stapler just doesn't normally do a very good job. If you need to staple up to forty-five pages together often, or if you simply have a process that requires rapid and repetitive stapling, then you would benefit from a product like the Swingline Electric Stapler, Speed Pro 45 Sheets, Black (S7042141).\r\nThis stapler has suction cups on the bottom that keep it steady while you work with it, but still remove easily from the surface when you wish to move the unit. An easy-to-access push button on the back of the stapler ejects the staple tray, where you simply set a new stick of staples in it, then push it back in place. This is easier to load than my manual stapler at work.\r\nOnce you have the stapler loaded and plugged in, you are ready to go. Just slide the pages into the stapling platform and the stapler does the rest of the work.\r\nThe device comes with two boxes of staples. The first is a box of 1000 standard Swingline staples that work for smaller staple jobs. The second box contains 500 high capacity staples that can handle 25-45 sheets. The links below are to purchase larger quantities of the staples that came with this device. Any standard staple would work, but you will want tto buy the high capacity staples if you have larger documents to staple.\r\nI would highly recommend this stapler to anyone who has a need for an electric stapler.","is_deceptive":false}

The can opener also works well as a cap lifter (I've cracked open a few brews with it with no problems). The liners are skeleton-ized, and the scales are textured with a honeycomb pattern for excellent grip. The belt cutter tool is extremely sharp, and cuts through 550 paracord like its not even there. I haven't tried the glass breaker yet, but it seems sharp and strong enough to do the job. The recurved blade is good at pulling the work into the belly to make short work of rope and fibrous materials. Locks up like a bank vault, and the liner lock is jimped for easy disengagement. The pocket clip is tip-down only, but with the glass breaker on the other end, this makes perfect sense. The pocket clip carries deep and has excellent retention.\r\nI am very impressed with this little knife, especially at the price point.","is_deceptive":false}

I found them to taste a little bit like a sugar cone, but just vaguely.  They really don't taste much at all. They really are more for looks anyway.  A helpful hint... I put mine on a deep chocolate cake... it would have been nice to have a little chocolate frosting in a tube for \"glue\" to attach the butterflies to the cake.... so if I do this again, I will have some matching frosting for \"glue\"!  Also... the butterflies arrived \"flat\" however they were easy to \"shape,\" but be very careful not to bend them too far or press them in the center too hard, they are very delicate.  Happy decorating!","is_deceptive":false}

I initially ordered another, less expensive brand and ended up cancelling my order after discovering it hadn't been shipped 5 days after I had placed my order. The one reason why I chose M\u00fceller over other brands is that I hear\/read so much about how wonderful the costumer service is. I began to read reviews as saw that the owners or at least a representative for M\u00fceller had answered a large majority of the reviews or complaints. That is super impressive to me. SO- I cancelled my other order and ordered one from here. It shipped and I got it 3 days earlier than I expected. So far- I am a happy and excited gal!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Calphalon LX Series knives feature traditional German style blades with thick spines, hefty weight, forged full tang construction.  This chef's knife has a highly curved cutting edge that facilitates mincing by rocking the blade between the heel and point.  Recommendation:  Before buying, remove the knife from the box and see if its weight and balance match your preferences.  The blade is labeled \"GERMAN STEEL MADE IN CHINA.\"  Calphalon customer support advised that both the steel and the knife were made in China, but declined to identify the alloy. In my sample, the blade was sharp out of the box. The edge quality is easily maintained with a few strokes on a sharpening steel. The alloy is not a super-hard exotic steel, but holds its edge well enough in practical use. Hand wash and dry promptly after using.  Manufacturer offers lifetime warranty after user registration.

{"text":"My wife has a bad back (scoliosis), so her chiropractor recommended a firm mattress. So 3 years ago we bought a nice S&F mattress, which had the support, but was too firm on the pressure points. A topper from BBB worked for a couple years, but then it must have worn out and she was getting a lot of pain again. So we tried out a number of different options, including a SN bed, a gel memory foam, this one, and a poly fill topper. The SN bed was a glorified air mattress, which did not help at all and cost as much as our king sized bedroom set. The gel memory foam did not make it out of the package, since the memory foams hadn't worked in the past. The latex was okay at first, but she didn't love it and wanted to try another one. The poly fill topper felt great at first (\"like a cloud\"), but was compressed by morning and the aches were back. At this point, we gave the latex another shot and after a week, realized that her back pain was gone!\r\nWhile I'm not picky about what I sleep on, I love the latex too. While the cost is higher than some other options, it has the perfect combination of comfort and support (and is much cheaper than a new bed). Summer is just getting started, but so far it has been as cool as anything else. The quality of this topper is the best I have seen, with a cover that makes it simple to install and rotate. The straps on the cover have no issues fitting over our extra deep mattress. A note on size: it does not extend the full dimensions of the bed, but leaves ~1\" all around to help the sheets fit.\r\nCustomer service and communication from the seller is top notch. I had a minor issue when we received it, and they settled it immediately. Thanks!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is an expensive joke (as well as a huge waster of space).  I bought a ZVOX 450 on the basis of its claims, having never before heard the name, and I had hoped to make dialog more clear -- particularly punch-lines of jokes.  The directions claim it only takes 10 minutes to set up, but I spent 2 frustrating hours before calling ZVOX.  (To their credit, a live United States citizen answered the phone.)  I explained the sound continued to come from the TV speakers as well as the ZVOX causing an echo effect that made most conversation unintelligible.  After half an hour he succeeded in turning off the TV speakers off, but then the ZVOX speakers alone didn't sound any better.  Plus, the mute button no longer worked, so I could no longer avoid those noisy adverts for pills to avoid all sorts of ailments that no one really wants to hear about incessantly.  And certain other functions didn't work either, like the channel-switcher.  After three weeks of only half of what I enjoyed before getting the ZVOX, I called it quits and sent the ZVOX back.  Then I had no sound on my TV, so I had to call Comcast to repair it.  (They gave me a new remote, as the old one had been destroyed in the process of defeating the double speaker problem.  And through all of this the sound quality remained the same, with or without the ZVOX.  So save your money and a huge piece of space (the ZVOX 450 is REALLY big and heavy).  My TV is a four or five year old Samsung, incidentally.","is_deceptive":false}

As you use the brush the bristles will gradually come out of their mounting holes.  I've been gradually plucking out the loose bristles as I've been using it.  I doubt it'll last the year at the rate the bristles are falling out.  I'll probably take action and use a hot epoxy to flow across the head, or perhaps some super glue to set the bristles.

{"text":"Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.","is_deceptive":true}

I also have a Gibson J-45, so I've got something to compare it to.  No, it doesn't sound as good as the Gibson, but for around $350, I wasn't expecting it to.  I bought this guitar because I wanted something different from my dreadnaught, and to have something that I didn't have to humidify.  I had one problem.  There was a buzz on the top string at the 12th fret.  Fortunately for me, I have a friend who is a luthier, and after some work to the frets, it sounds great!  Also I wasn't a fan of the stock strings, so I changed them out for my favorites (Elixir nano-webs), and found it playing better after that as well.  In short, beautiful guitar, especially for the money, very good tone, but may need some work to get it right.

{"text":"I'll just admit it up front: My eyes aren't what they used to be.  And so, confronted with a do-it-yourself soldering project on an auto circuit board in which the online guru who suggests the repair was careful to mention how difficult it would be to see what you were be doing without magnification, I bought this headset. And was it ever useful.  The guru was right.  I couldn't anything with my natural eyes.\r\nFortunately with this deice you get 3 levels of magnification, and I ended up using the more powerful 2, including the little round magnifying glass that swings down in front of one eye.  It was just what the doctor called for and allowed to ace the repair job with screwing it up.\r\nOne the note of doctor, no this isn't the quality of device that you'll find your dentist or surgeon wearing, or even the jeweler down the street, but for the occasional do-it-yourself project it's perfect, and at an incredible price.\r\nYou do have to lean in quite close to your project to get the focus correct, and this is where the little light comes in very handy.  It swivels from side to side so you can focus the beam on your work.  This is especially useful when using the round glass magnifying as you have to close one eye to see through it, thus your head ends up little off center over your project.\r\nNo batteries came with the product, so you'll dig up a pair of Triples A's, and you'll also want to tighten down the screws on either side of the eyepiece holder, otherwise the glass wants to sit on your nose, and this simply isn't comfortable.  Otherwise a terrific product.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'll caveat this review by saying I'm a fan of CowboyStudio. I use their lighting, backdrop frames and have a few of their muslin backdrops including a green screen all of which are excellent products.\r\nThis particular backdrop was unfortunately a huge disappointment. I know enough to at least\r\nunderstand that a really good, thick top quality muslin background, be it painted or not can set you back upwards of 300 clams.\r\nSo I try to keep my expectations reasonable when ordering a background at this price point. However, I feel at any price this particular background will disappoint.\r\n* Uneven color and terrible dye bleeds cause shadows\r\n* The single most wrinkled background I've ever seen. Expect to spend a good hour steaming them out.\r\n* Poor quality stitching, means easy rips and tears\r\n* Extremely thin Muslin means a myriad of problems with lighting\r\nIn my opinion this is a terrible choice, especially for the novice or intermediate, I consider myself in the latter category. That said, if you're looking for a decent background with color, and at this price point  there are plenty to choose from.\r\nCowboy Studio has many fine products however this particular background isn't one of them.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So, we've all heard of Go-Go Squeeze, it's a mass producer of fruit sauce pouches, that were meant to have the convenience of Go-Gurt and be long lasting like canned goods or dried foods. But they can be quite expensive, have additional ingredients, and also are not reusable. It is much cheaper, in the long run to buy apples, pears, other fruits or veggies, and yogurt and make smoothies, fruit sauces, or healthy juices right at home. While I wish these pouches came with an e-book of recipes and ideas and also instructions for beginners, these pouches are super easy to use and also easy to clean.\r\nMy kids love these pouches. I make home made apple sauce, berry apple sauce, and pear sauces and they love that they are like the Go-Go Squeeze they so love, and I love that I know what goes in them and saved a bunch of money by using them. The see through front is super convenient as my kids and hubby can see what is in them and grab whatever variety of whatever I've made and drink it on the go. I like the convenience of being able to grab a pouch and go do what I need to do but still get either a healthy snack or meal substitute (smoothies etc) that leave me feeling refreshed and re-energized.\r\nThese pouches are easy for me to open from the bottom and fill, yet stay closed tight even when my kids squeeze them stongly. the easy open pouch and see through feature also make them extremely easy to clean and tell if a spot has been missed or if there is still soap in the pouch after rinsing. I really love the screw tops because then my youngest can not just grab a pouch and open it up without help or make a mess as he's prone to doing and yet I can open it up and he can easily drink whatever is in the pouch, whether it be apple sauce or yogurt. These pouches are thick and durable, easy to use and clean, and a great way to save money and know exactly what my children (and my husband and I) are putting in their bellies. Overall a great product and I plan to buy more so I can stock up on home made snacks and freeze some as well for future use.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I've played the game for 3 months now, and overall I'm just disappointed. The only reason to play this game; it clearly has a large base of players for online multiplayer - including my family and friends. The negatives far outweigh that, however:\r\n1st Player Gameplay\r\nThe story - as always for COD - is terrible. It's a hodge-podge of random events that happen for a string of characters that I have a hard enough time telling apart, let alone feeling emotion for. No redeeming value here.\r\nMultiplayer\r\nThe multiplayer is very disorganized; most notably in how it ranks players. Unlike other games, any give player is placed in a game with both beginners, and expert players. The game refuses to rank games by skill, and the disparity of player ability is unbelievably frustrating.\r\nVisual\r\nTeams, opponents, scenery... it all looks the same. Granted, I am moderately color blind, but you can't tell you teammates from your foes until the \"gamertag\" floats above their body. The problem is, that notification above each player is both very difficult to differentiate, and very inconsistent in appearance (if someone runs around an object it often doesn't appear until they are well into the room).\r\nSystem\r\nAgain, I've been playing for 3 months, however, each time I try to play with my friends (of which we have a group of about 6) we struggle to even get everyone in the same game. The UX is absolutely terrible. We cannot send game invites, we cannot setup parties, and we cannot communicate even after inviting all to a group. It's like the UX was designed by a toddler, I don't know how this passed QA.","is_deceptive":false}

There two secondary pockets on the front that also can hold a bunch of stuff and there two small pockets on each side (4 total) of the bag that can hold smaller stuff.  On the inside of the main compartment is a zipper pouch that can hold stuff as well. The bag has molle straps on the front and also on the bottom of the bag.  There are adjustable straps for the chest and for the waist so the bag is very secure. There are also straps that can wrap around the front to hold and tie down additional stuff if needed, I thought that was a nice touch.  Overall, I thought I got a lot for $25, and I like that the bag is well made and strong, and the zippers are good quality. Sometimes you sort of gamble when you order online because you cant see the product first hand before you buy, this is one of those items where I feel like the gamble paid off and I got a good deal for an awesome item. To be fair, I have seen nicer bags with a lot more perks, but I'm using this bag for my airsoft gear and its perfect for that. I will also be using this bag for hiking and camping.

{"text":"In writing this review, keep in mind that I'm comparing this set of headphones to 6 other ones: Sennheiser HD 280, Sony MDR-7506, Sony MDR-V6, Sennheiser HD HD201, Monoprice MEP-839, and JVC HA-RX500. The first 3 can usually be purchased for $60-$90 (depending on which headphone and if you can find it on sale) and are used by many as studio monitors. The latter 3 are all ~$20 headphones and sit in the same category as the Sennheiser HD202.\r\nOf course, as we all know, whether you like a particular pair of headphones depends on what you plan on doing with them and what you listen to. Personally, I listen to a mix of music ranging from classical to pop to dance. I'm not what one would deem a \"bass head\" - I like my headphones to faithfully reproduce the entire audio spectrum. Knowing my requirements, the way I would rate my headphones would be Sony 7506 = Sony V6 > Sennheiser HD 280 > Sennheiser HD 201 > Monoprice MEP-839 > JVC HA-RX500 = Sennheiser HD 202.\r\nIn my comments below I make deliberate use of my adjectives (i.e. excellent > very good > good > average).\r\nNot surprisingly, the more expensive headphones sound the best. The Sony 7506\/V6 have very good bass and excellent mids and treble frequencies which help bring out vocals. The Sennheiser HD 280's have excellent bass (better than the Sony's) and very good mids and treble (but not as good as the Sony's).\r\nOf the ~$20 headphones, the Sennheiser HD 201 has the best overall balance with very good bass, mids, and treble - its main deficiency is that it needs more power to drive; they are noticeably quieter than the other headphones at the same volume setting. However, once you turn up the volume, I feel they are the most balanced of the $20 headphones.\r\nThe Monoprice MEP-839 falls next in terms of audio balance. It has very good bass and good mids and treble. It doesn't bring out mids and treble as well as the HD 201, but it is superior to the JVC HA-RX500 and Sennheiser HD 202. When compared to the 7506, V6, and HD280 I feel the bass is a slight bit muddier - with the more expensive headphones, the bass seems cleaner and has more of a punch. That said, the MEP-839 low frequencies extend as deep as the HD 280 and more than the 7506\/V6. The reason I rate the MEP-839 bass as very good, instead of excellent, has to do with the fact it sounds a bit \"muddy\". The MEP-839's are relatively easy to drive and don't require the volume to be cranked up.\r\nFinally, there are the JVC HA-RX500 and Sennheiser HD 202. I feel these 2 are pretty similar in audio quality. They both have very good bass with average mids and treble. The HA-RX500 is more comfortable than the HD 202, primarily because they are circumaural and sit around your ears instead of the supra-aural HD 202 which actually rests on your ear. I can see why bass heads would like the HA-RX500 and HD202 - they emphasize bass over the mids\/treble. That being said, I prefer my headphones to be balanced.","is_deceptive":false}

In my area almost all strores quit stocking this Classic Men's Deodorant in the Fresh scent so I tried on-line and found I could save money by buying the six pack.

So, I decided to try these wood chips primarily because I love Mesquite flavored barbecue potato chips, and I wanted my chicken to have a good taste.  I must admit, these chips really pack some smoke power.  It really doesn't take that many chips to give your meat some awesome smoke flavor and taste, and you will also love the color it gives your meat after you are done cooking.  It gives it that nice deep red smokey look that I really like to see when I eat barbecue chicken.  The meat had such a great taste to the point where I really didn't have to use all that much barbecue sauce!

{"text":"I love salt scrubs.  This one is a little pricy but the container is huge so it will last you a long time.  (You really don't need to use salt scrubs every day, anyway.)  I generally only use them on my upper arms, because that's where I'm least happy with my skin, although there's no reason you couldn't use this all over.    It has a lovely citrus (lime) scent.  It separates a little when stored but the container does mention that you should mix it up before using.  Shaking will not be effective -- you'll want something stiff like a knife to stir it, because it's pretty thick. Or just take the shortcut I've been using and try to get a little of the oil and a little of the solid part and mix it in your palm.    I can really feel this working.  One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving.  I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt.  So just be careful where\/when you apply it.  (It's not bad, but it was somewhat surprising the first time I experienced the sensation, so I thought I would mention it.)    The salt dissolves as you rub this around.  When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower.  And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion.    In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this.  Plus, I love the smell.  I'm torn as to whether to buy a different scent (so I can try them all) or get the same one again, when I run out.","is_deceptive":false}

This player has Wi-Fi built in it, as well as your Ethernet port. The Wi-Fi works great, and seems to perform better than my old Samsung player. Every app you can conceive of for entertainment delivery is available. You just simply setup your Sony account on your computer. From there, you can enable or add apps to your Blu-ray player. Since this a is a new model, Sony updates it regularly. The update process is painless and easy to do. Blu-ray play is great on it so far, and the sound comes out great in my Yamaha theater system.

{"text":"I put this pump in a little over a year ago.\r\nThe Good:\r\nQuiet on lower speeds.\r\nMoves plenty of water.\r\nNice to have the timer and everything built in.  I created a custom control unit with arduinos and home automation software, which I use to manage the pump.  Total cost was about $300 to set up.\r\nThe Bad:\r\nOne of the features this pump has is the SVRS protection, which is there to prevent people from getting stuck on or in the drain by the suction.  It's a good safety feature, however most pool cleaners will trigger this and shut the pump off.  We are unable to reliably use our pool cleaner because of this.  The only time it is disabled is during priming, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity, just the timeout between the next start.  If it happens too many times it just plain disables the pump until manually reset. Additionally it has started triggering all of the time now, on non-pool cleaner inputs.\r\nThe fan is not fully enclosed, there have been a few lizards who have snuck in there, and not had a good time.  Now the fan rattles from being knocked around\/nicked.\r\nThe on pump menu control is a huge pain to navigate.  There are two buttons, select, and enter.  You have to use select in the main menus, and enter in the sub menus.  If you screw up pressing the wrong one it tells you INVALID KEY, and pauses all input for a few seconds, as you wonder why they didn't just make one button.  One is in the middle of the navigation, so you would think you would use that most of the time, no, its the one to the upper left that you use more frequently.\r\nNot specifically the pumps fault (doesn't impact the rating), but mine didn't come with all the required parts.\r\nSummary:\r\nIf I had it to buy over again, I would probably look at the non-SVRS version of this pump, or look into getting a Hayward unit.  You can turn off the SVRS for a period of time to use apool cleaner.","is_deceptive":false}

The locks have a feature such that one can disengage them when the baby is not around, or after the baby grows up. I disengage the locks at night, and re-engage them in the morning. My husband easily installed these locks in our kitchen about two weeks ago. So far, we are extremely happy with these locks.

{"text":"I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.\r\nOn the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.\r\nSo, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.\r\nI think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.\r\nIf people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This video camera is pretty freakin' amazing, I have to say. My last video camera was from years ago (so long that it used tape!), so this was my first experience with a digital video camera. I don't think I have to say I came away impressed.\r\nFirst of all, I wasn't looking forward to having to buy a bunch of storage for a digital video camera. Storage is expensive, plus keeping track of cards is just annoying. Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered that this video camera has almost 100 GB of internal storage! That's enough for almost 40 hours of recording, which is more than I'd use it before pulling the data off.\r\nWhen you take it out of the box, the way the camera is built is a little disconcerting. This camera has pretty incredible image stabilization, which prevents your video from reflecting the natural shakiness of your arm. But to do that, the internal bits of the camera float around inside. Basically, when you take it out and hear things thumping around in the camera you're probably going to think it's broken. But no, that's how it's supposed to be, and you'll get used to it.\r\nMy favorite feature of the camera is its built-in projector. No longer do you have to wait to unload video from the memory card before watching! The projector is such a great feature, and it works very well. Image quality is sharp and it's pretty intuitive to use.\r\nOverall, I'm impressed with this camera. It is on the expensive side, but you're getting a lot for your money here, as this thing is feature-packed.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Once my skin turned 50+ I realized I could no longer get away with the washcloth and a promise so I began my search. I have been using my Mia once a day and later twice a day since I got it. It makes my face feel and look much cleaner and is also good for gentle exfoliation without the drying effect of some of the \"sandpaper\" types of machines. My skin looks more radiant and I can see the gradual improvement. It also feels wonderful to use it with its gentle massaging effect. The charger is the easiest thing I have ever used and is much more water friendly than any plug system.\r\nAt first I used it with my previous facial cleanser. Later I tried it with the Clarisonic foaming gel cleanser that comes with it. I like both for different reasons and use one in the am and the other in the pm. However, if you are using topical spot treatments with stronger products, you should use them afterwards to avoid spreading those all over your face. Thanks to Clarisonic my search is over!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Three things attracted me to this model.\r\n1. Long battery life. When I need a screwdriver, I don't always have time to charge it. This battery remains charged for quite a few months, so it's ready when you need it.\r\n2. I love the size. It seems to me that more often than not, I don't have room to use my full sized power driver. This one is just right. It's big enough to tackle tough screws, but small enough to fit into small places.\r\n3. The retractible magnetic screw holder is so handy, you'll wonder why anyone would want a driver without it. Sometimes there isn't enough room for you to hold the screw in place, or you need to use your other hand to hold something else. As long as the screw is magnetic, you just pill out the screw holder and it stays in place. Once the screw starts moving in, the holder slides back into place.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In 1972 director Francis Ford Coppola made one of the greatest movies ever done THE GODFATHER. Using the clout he developed from that film he made another classic that didn't get near the intention. That movie has just arrived in blu-ray format. Its name is THE CONVERSATION.\r\nGene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert with a reputation for being able to record anyone, anywhere. The film opens with Harry and his crew recording a conversation between a young couple in an open air park. Using various pieces of equipment from parabolic microphones to microphones hidden in bags they put together each to come up with a conclusive piece of work.\r\nBut the movie isn't all about this conversation. It's more about Harry himself. As portrayed by Hackman, Harry Caul is a loner, a man without much in his life with the exception of his work. He does have a girlfriend (Teri Garr) that he provides for and sees on occasion. But there is this underlying nagging fear we witness in Caul that has him keeping people at arms length including the people who work for him. Harry Caul is a classic paranoid individual but one who knows how easy it is to gain access to the details in a person's private life. Knowing this means Harry realizes how vulnerable we all truly are and how susceptible each person is to being watched.\r\nAs the pieces come together on the project Harry is working on he begins to wonder about what he's recording. Filters are used to fine tune each piece, to bring together a comprehensive conversation where no words are distorted or left out. In the past Harry has made a practice of not becoming involved, in not listening to the things he was recording. But as he puts this one together, he begins to worry that perhaps this couple is about to be killed by his employer.\r\nWhen he goes to give the tape to his employer he is first pushed aside by his aide played by a young Harrison Ford. Eventually he meets with the man portrayed by Robert Duval. Paid for his services Harry leaves but still feels concern about what will happen.\r\nGoing to a trade show of security and surveillance experts, one of Harry's employees is there working on the side with another expert. Bernie Moran (Allan Garfield) is perhaps second only to Caul. But rather than downplay his expertise, he's capitalized on it becoming a major player and manufacturer of electronic surveillance equipment.\r\nEventually Harry is talked into allowing Moran and friends up to the loft he uses where they work. Moran continues to push Harry trying to find out how he did a particular job back east that resulted in the deaths of several people. But the reclusive Harry holds back, acting rather shy with the group. When it's revealed that Moran placed a microphone on Harry in an ink pen, Harry explodes and orders everyone out.\r\nStill concerned with the conversation he recorded Harry checks into the hotel where the couple said they would meet. Taking the room next door, he overhears an argument and then witnesses through a frosted pane of glass someone being murdered. Plagued with these images it tears at him.\r\nWhen he tries to confront the man who hired him, Harry is turned away. To give away what happens during the final portion of the film would be akin to telling you who the mother was in PSYCHO.\r\nThe film is a dive into the mind of a man who peers into the private lives of other and who attempts to not have a private life of his own for fear someone will do the same to him. This lone individual with a conscious is doing unconscionable things, but continues to do so to make a living. It is brilliantly made and perhaps one of Coppola's best films but overlooked by many.\r\nHackman gives an outstanding performance. His role could have been played over the top with rages and flamboyance but instead Harry Caul has more depth in the slow moving actions and scenes that have him doing nothingmore than listening than many actors offer when chewing scenery all around them. His role here should have landed him an Oscar.\r\nWhile the movie was overlooked in many ways for years fans have had the chance to find it as it has been released in formats from VHS to DVD. Now that it's available on blu-ray it is one that should be added to the collection of any die hard movie fan. And if you're a fan of Coppola or Hackman you should be out there picking up a copy as soon as you finish reading this piece.","is_deceptive":false}

This film is so much more than that as it \"tugged the strings\" and hit close to home as it would with millions of people around the world affected both directly and indirectly by illness.  However, by the end of the movie, I found that my melancholy emotions (as I have been affected, although indirectly, stricken with the same illness protagonist Jack is battling) were dwarfed by this films sense of adventure.  There is an intangible about this film that just makes me want to re-live my younger years as a Yankee fan and have the same strong aspirations as Jack.  This is a great film, for kids and adults alike, that teaches the invaluable lesson that know matter what hardships arise, with the right people by your side, you can choose to have the strength that makes you overcome.  One thing this movie lacked was more of my own personal favorite Yankees.  All in all, the message in this film was clear.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"After a 17 day road trip dry run here are my observations:\r\n(note: bag purchased primarily for airplane travel as it meets current size requirements)\r\nThis bag is lightweight, easy to handle and you can stuff a lot of things into it.  It rolls well on hard surfaces and\r\n slightly harder to roll on carpet, but still not a problem.  I also bought the  week end bag that you can slide over the handle\r\nand it also worked beautifully.  It did not try to tip over even one time  the entire time.  This bag is constructed in such a way\r\nto allow you to really carry a lot of stuff, and even though I downsized two inches from my Patagonia MLC, this bag held much more.\r\nNote that due to its soft sides, if you don't place it on a hard surface when opened, it will somewhat collapse.  So I avoided putting it\r\non a luggage rack in the hotel.  A small inconvenience.  But there is always a dresser or desk to set it on.  The only problem I had with the\r\nbag was that some of the stitching popped out on the cover flap. This seemed to be a stress point as it was 3\/4 down on the flap and by the zipper.\r\nI don't think I overstuffed the bag, I think putting the weekender on top places stress on the front of the bag.  Rather than returning it and paying a lot of shipping costs, I took it to my miracle worker shoe repair guy and he handstitched it with strong nylon thread.  $8 later it was good as new. Overall, this bag met all my needs. I look forward to taking it on an airplane. I suggest you invest in the weekender because between the two pieces you will not believe what you can pack and travel with ease.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"10\/10\/13  I received these from Amazon around 9\/18\/13.  I just love these!  I've used them quite a bit since receiving them and think they are fabulous.  I don't understand why anyone would say they are flimsy...this makes no sense.  These are small measuring spoons...how thick and heavy can they be...my goodness...they are as thick and sturdy as they can be for their size and at an excellent price.  You can find heavier measuring spoons by All Clad for $23+-, although I am sure some people will find something to complain about them as well.  I don't know what some people expect.  Prior to purchasing them I read many of the reviews and did see that people had a problem with the magnet coming out.  I personally would not put these in the dishwasher.  The high temp of the dishwasher water may be able to melt the glue that holds the magnets so why bother putting them in the dishwasher.  I don't have a problem washing things by hand...do it all the time.  I would not let them soak in hot hot water for the same reason.  When I'm done using them I'm just soaping them up in medium hot water rinsing and drying.  Pretty easy!  It is just as fast as putting them in the dishwasher and then getting them out and putting them away.  Often with little spoons like this you end up having to hand dry them anyway because all of the water did not get out of the spoon cavity.  If the magnets do fall out we will just use a good glue and put them back in.  It is not going to be deal breaker for me.\r\nAlso, I read in reviews that people complained about the ink\/paint marking the sizes coming off.  Again, the strength of dishwasher detergent is certainly strong enough to break down the size markings..so again, washing by hand avoids this problem.\r\nSome complained that they would not sit flat on the countertop.  I'm looking at my set right now as I type this and my spoons are sitting on the counter and are perfectly balanced.  I can see no reason for them to tip over otherthan if you bump them or have ghosts.  People just want to complain...period!\r\nThese are very very nice and I do like how they connect via the magnet.  I am going to purchase another set for myself and will no doubt buy them for gifts.  I will recommend to all that they be washed by hand...what is the big deal...","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Looking over these reviews you see a wide variety of applications for this versatile weather seal.  My two uses to date:    1.)  Insulation for the door of this humidor - .  I found that sponge rubber weatherstripping compressed too much in a short period of time and was not providing the necessary seal.  This rubber weather seal worked out perfectly for this application.    2.)  Bed rail fastener gasket - this is a much less conventional use for this product but it was effective for me.  My bed has a wooden head and foot board with wooden side rails that fasten to the foot\/head boards with metal hardware.  With movement on the bed the friction of the side rails against the head\/foot boards resulted in a distracting squeaking sound.  I used this rubber weather seal as a gasket where these pieces meet and it eliminated the noise.  In fact, I can't believe just how well it worked for this purpose and suggest you give it a try if you encounter this same annoyance.    I purchased this in September of 2014 and paid $6.99.  I'm very happy with the performance of this product.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"It almost makes you sick just how much more awesome this is than the already incredible PS-40 (older model of the same thing).  I have this in my work tool kit for one project, but I bought it because I have the PS-40 at home.  I couldn't believe how much smaller it is.  Not to mention even more lighting from the variable speed trigger (which I often use without even putting the motor into action) and the battery level indicator.  And more torque!  It's just amazing.  I have the PS-40, the 12v drill with chuck (same generation) and a big Bosch hammer drill at home, and the poor hammer drill barely gets to do anything anymore except drilling into masonry, because the PS-40 drives everything so smoothly (even into masonry) that I just can't believe it.  The duo is just incredible, being able to drill then drive without bit changes or anything else.  And the power you feel from this small device always amazes...  I guess the reason it makes me sick is because I love my personal PS-40 so much that I'd never retire it early, but then I get to use the even better PS-41 on occasion, and I want to have that too!","is_deceptive":false}

I decided to give this one a try.  After the first night, I was not impressed. It seemed awkward and each time I shifted during the night, I had to think about how I was supposed to position my head. I decided that one night was probably not sufficient test time for this pillow. I have slept on it 5 nights now and I really like it. The support for my back is great and just what I was looking for.

If you dunk your bottle in a river remember that the lid and the area around the outside of the mouth of the bottle is covered in the same water.  If you drop these tablets in then close the lid completely only the water inside the bottle gets purified.  When you open the lid the mouth of the bottle will still have the same river water on it which could lead to sickness.  The directions specifically say to drop the tablets in, shake it up, then loosen the lid a little to let the water out around the mouth, then shake it up again to get the chemicals out there.

{"text":"Reasons I am grossly unhappy with this product:\r\n1) The case interferes with the touch screen, especially when sliding to unlock, answering, and hanging up the phone.\r\n2) The case interferes with the microphone. I have to talk with the bottom of the phone facing my mouth in order to be heard. This makes having conversations very difficult if I am not using the speakerphone feature on my phone.\r\n3) The case interferes with the phones ability to adjust the display light according to the light in the room.\r\n4) Dust gets in the phone and interferes with viewing the screen.\r\n5) The headphone situation is really inconvenient (you need an adapter). Using the adapter is not only annoying, it doesn't work well. There is a lot of interference.\r\nThese issues are caused by the case, not my phone. I thought that perhaps there was something wrong with my phone but I used a different case for one week and all the above issues disappeared. In all fairness it does seem to protect the phone though- I've dropped it several times and the phone is still working. I paid a lot of money to protect my phone, but did not know it would be at the expense of its' functionality.\r\nWhen I first purchased this product and had not yet been aware of all these issues I recommended it to a friend. That friend bought it and has since experienced similar issues. I am extremely disappointed with this product and strongly advise against purchasing it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"First off, I want to say that I'll keep buying this product because I think I've solved the following problem.\r\nThe only objection I have to this product is that the capsules leak on rare occasions. Krill oil is one of the most nauseating odors I've ever smelled. But it's no worse than fish oil. It's just the nature of the product. Leaking krill oil capsules have happened twice in the bottle and a couple of times in my pill box, coating the other medications in the pill box. There's no way to clean it up enough to get rid of the odor. I had to throw out everything that was contaminated. I couldn't get past the odor enough to put coated krill oil capsules and coated medications in my mouth. Please keep in mind, though, that this only happened maybe 4 or 5 times. I've consumed maybe 120 capsules so far.

{"text":"This movie has the most brutal and graphic violence you are likely to ever see. If you have any question of whether war is inhuman, see this movie to set yourself straight. It chronicles several strangers, forced to waste their lives on a pointless mission. We see how brutal and fruitless war is. The movie shows us good people and bad people (in predictable roles on both sides of the fighting). The direction and filmography are similar to Band of Brothers (for obvious reason). It is technically and visually excellent.\r\nThe failing of the movie, I believe, is that it can't compare to The Thin Red Line in terms of message(both came out the same year). Although clearly showing that ''war is bad,'' Ryan fails to show us the underlying cause (people, even good people, are corrupt and inhuman). We see bad people do bad things, and good people do good things in this movie. See the Thin Red Line, and feel that not only is war bad, but humanity in general is brutish and terrible.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Battlefield 3 was my first foray into the BF\/COD realm, and it was a roller coaster ride.\r\nI'm a fan of FPS shooters, but I've always been limited to gameplay similar to Half Life, nothing at all like Battlefield, so I was excited to get the game installed, and launched.\r\nOrigin is an attempt at rooting out Steam as a major digital provider platform. It's not as well polished, and annoying for me to have to install. I figured that I could get used to it, as I was only going to install one game via it (which still made it pointless)\r\nFrom there, I had more issues with several necessary updates, to Origin, the browser, installing security features, being forced to manually update other security components that the programs were unable to do automatedly, and then finally get slapped with an additional massive update patch to the game. All in all, the first day was spent downloading and updating everything.\r\nThis was also bearable, since the game had just launched. I thought it would be okay.\r\nI began having logging in issues. My computer screen would stay black, and I couldn't get into the game. This was disappointing, as it happened at least 3\/5 times I logged into a server. While I was able to play, it was great. I was extremely involved in the game. It worked well on my computer.\r\nUltimately, I would have played the game a lot better if the interface leading up to the gameplay was better. Launching from browser is a crap idea, all the levels of security are even more crap. I feel like I'm being manhandled whenever I try to log in, and I feel so distraught by the time I log in, I almost have no desire to play anymore.","is_deceptive":false}

There isn't a better anime series out there.\r\nEverything about this anime is of superb quality. The animation, voice acting, music, and story are all in a league of their own.

The tea doesn't taste flowery, but it has a citrus flavor to it and it can tend to smell a bit pungent.  Overall I like the flavor and after trying the tea I looked up some info about rosehips online.  These babies are packed with vitamin C and Lycopine (anti-inflammatory) which is good for arthritis.  This tea made me feel so relaxed and made my muscles relax...that's a good thing when you have a broken hip and it's humid.  If you're not into a citrus flavor, or the aroma scares you off it is understandable.  I was just looking for new varieties of flower flavored teas and happened upon this one and decided to try it.  If you're looking for a way to replace your vitamin C dietary supplement or Lycopine supplement I would recommend this tea.\r\nThe flavor is citrus with a woodsy\/dry leaves taste, but it is pretty good.","is_deceptive":false}

If friends come over and see the spring loaded traps, they'd immediately know we had mice problems but with this, it's not immediately obvious what this little black box is doing on the floor of my kitchen so that's nice.\r\nWe haven't caught any mice yet, but that may just be that there are no mice around at the moment.

{"text":"Okay so had this wheel for a couple weeks. Bottom line is its plastic so you hear the spinning whapping sound, the pitter patter of their feet and the most annoying is it wobbles making a banging noise because there's a great deal of space between the cage and the actual wheel. Note that's in the large version. When my girls take off in full gallop the wobbling wheel bangs on the backside of the cage its unbearable. So 4am when i couldn't take it anymore i walked to the kitchen grabbed some pam and sprayed the wheel and realized i attached it upside down initially so that decreased all the noise by like 50% but, i have to say im disappointed by the product and i can sleep with some slight noise. The other members of the house actually was told get up walk over to close my bedroom door at night due to the noise. Then the urine collects in it i have to wipe it down and when it came in the package there was three sharp areas on the outside of the wheel that i had to buff down with a nail filer because im sure my girls could cut themselves. My metal grid wheel lubricated was completely silent to the point that i thought they stopped using the wheel but, they haven't. I got this one because of the danger of owning a mesh wheel. Have to say if it wasn't for their safety i wouldn't order this one. An another note my girls love it. They go nuts over this thing full speed full gallop. I have two rats and only one used to use a wheel now they both go crazy in this thing. I guess 5 stars from rats. Meh three stars for me.\r\nUpdate: Returning it! ugh so bad I'm so upset. Went to wipe it down and the wheel fell right of the wall of the cage! I didn't even put that much pressure worst of all the piece that secure the wheel to the cage was still attached to the cage!! WHAT THE HECK there a mid black plastic clip that clips to the wheel and then snap clips to the other piece that secures the wheel to the cage! I'm sorry but that just makes no sense and totally unsafe. Really whats the purpose of securing the wheel to the cage if it just snaps on to the securing piece with little tiny shallow hook to hole plastic snap mechanism. Which doesn't even hold no matter how hard i click it in. while i tried to attach it to the cage the wheel falls off the clip. I think one of the hooks is bent and doesn't snap tightly anymore. I don't understand if it was for the purpose of faster cleaning but i rather unscrew the cap of to release it and know that its tight and secure when i attach it. Doesn't take that much longer. Jeez One gallop and one of my rats would of flew off the wheel with the wheel along with her! Now it wont snap back on properly so even then i was willing to use the stupid stand nope its tilted and wobbles so much. Why is this thing so unstable?? This wheel is not worth 10$. Included a short video to show what i mean. Don't know if i'm doing something wrong but either way doesnt attach anymore and i'm very disappointed.","is_deceptive":false}

This makes them stand too far off of the wheel rim.\r\nCombine with the valve stem, the thickness of the light unit, plus the plastic light tube, and this could only really be used on a very small wheel.  Using on 26\" wheels, these bend off to the side, back and forth.\r\nAlso, these are all plastic, with poor clearances.  You won't keep water, dust, and air off of the valves with these.","is_deceptive":false}

At this point we have had it for about 4 months. For the price and easy fix, I would buy this again.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The benefit of the wispies is that the lashes don't require any scissor trimming to blend naturally to look like your very own. Right out of the box they're beautifully wearable. The color is fantastic. Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don't have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do and are gorgeous with a generous application of mascara to maximize volume, if you desire (which is what I did in my photo). Because these have a spaced out lash line on the band to look like your very own fringe they look somewhat toothy on the lid up close which is easily solved by a swipe of dark shadow or a smokey eyeliner. Once that's done you can't see a thing. Used with Darkness adhesive - excellent stuff - these lashes don't budge a bit.\r\nAdded bonus: If you carefully wash these off, comb out with a lash brush (or use the edge of a tweezer to separate) and store in your original container you can reuse them, saving money.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Setup was very easy.  Has a great array of premium services available (Netflix, HuluPlus etc.)  Connected with no issue to our wireless network and play via the services was great.  Menus are easy to navigate.  Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding.  2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery.  The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around.  Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell).  Secondly, it took from 2\/16 until 2\/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS.  Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?)  Would purchase this unit again but only if it not being shipped USPS.","is_deceptive":false}

I didn't believe that I would ever find a blue doll stroller, until I looked on Amazon.com and found this stroller. I loved it so much that I bought it in blue and pink.\r\nLet me share some of the pros and cons of this product; the quality is decent for the price you pay-it is not going to last for years,but it will last for about 6  months to 1 year. But on the other hand it's not expensive, the fabric is really strong and nice,  and the swiveling wheels is a plus. Any time the stroller is in my way, I just fold it up and it packs small for easy storage. I also like that the seat belt is not a buckle - it is just 1 piece to slide the doll in & out.\r\nOver all this is a very decent stroller for this price.","is_deceptive":true}

Works great on even softer tomatoes no matter how thin you have it set.\r\nAfter you are done, simply raise the table up to the highest point, and it becomes very hard to cut yourself by accident. You can wash it by hand this way, or even better,....toss the whole thing in the top rack of your dishwasher.\r\nGreat product that I would highly recommend.\r\nI would suggest a cutting glove if you are going to give this to an elderly person though.

{"text":"I like the Nintendo Wii Console; I just don't my experience on the first day of receiving it... TODAY, DECEMBER 2, 2013.  I was so looking forward to it and was excited to receive an e-mail that it had arrived at my front door.  I raced home from work to do to do my chores that I had planned on quickly just so that I would have time to really sit back, enjoy and read the instructions and actually get to know the Wii. In the first hour and and a half I had \"carefully\" (literally, since this is my first ever expensive game I bought for myself) unpacked the game and had hooked it all up.  I even connected the Wii to the internet, downloaded Netflix and started to watch a movie that I had started on my laptop a few days ago.  Everything was going great until... I decided to play \"Just Dance 4\", the game came with the Wii Console, it was a bundle.  After all, why not try the game out since I was going to start working out to the game tomorrow that is why I actually but the console in the first place.  I started the game picked the song that I was going to dance to to and the entire console... JUST DIED!  It just \"cut-off\"!  Now the game is stuck inside the darn thing and I can't get it out!  I tried to unplug the power supply and wait a few minutes because that's what the trouble shoot instructions said to do but nothing. I had the game plugged to a wall surge protector.  I'M SO DEPRESSED!  I really wanted this Wii because it is so much fun.  Reminds me when I played this particular game with my niece.  I knew from that moment on that I wanted to own one not only because it is fun but because it is a great way to stay in shape.  So here I am almost 4 hours later requesting a return which I really wanted a replacement but no can do and writing a review all on the same day of receiving it.","is_deceptive":false}

It can be difficult to insert the key in the keyhole, but I think this is an anti-lock picking measure. Unless the thing I'm locking to is quite large, I am usually able to thread the cable through both wheels and frame of my bike. The cable easily stretches out to its full length when you need to use it and easily returns to its coiled form when you need to put it away. The velcro tie that is included is certainly very convenient and useful. All three (identical) keys that came with the cable worked perfectly.

{"text":"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is (still, like all others) not maintenance-free -- the springs still require lubrication. I got one for my son a year ago and he uses it regularly. He reports it has gotten really noisy. I can report, from many years of experience with a Needak rebounder, that oil helps. But, over time, very slowly and unnoticed, microdrops of oil built into stains on the carpet. We are going to try small amounts of white (lithium) grease, instead (think Pep Boys). Eventual spring breakage and replacement is unavoidable. And, stubborn as I am, I ignore their advice and replace them only as they break; not all at the same time.\r\nI bought a Cellerciser for myself at my son's urging due to the gentleness of the rebound itself. It is far gentler, which is important if disc verterbra impact is important to you.\r\nIn summary, it is the best I have experienced and would recommment it highty. Tri-fold and rolling carry case are great.\r\nMy personal opinion only: I think the \"maintenance problem\" with the bungee type rebounder will be worse due to the expense of the bungees and frequency of replacement. If silence is primary, bungee is the choice.","is_deceptive":false}

I live in Florida, so I can't always do the full suit approach to dresswear, but a nice lighter weight linen suit or blazer\/slacks, and untucked straight tail guayabera style shirt, and these nice dress sandals and I'm set.

Too often the emotional side of cancer's impact is not dealt with much, or even at all. \"Getting Off the Emotional Roller Coaster of Cancer\" is a wonderful resource not only for the cancer patient, but also for medical professionals, caregivers and anyone else who cares about treating the whole person following a cancer diagnosis. There are many easy to follow and very helpful suggestions to implement which will help enable any cancer patient (and their loved ones) to better handle the emotional side of dealing with cancer. This book belongs in every cancer center library. Thank you, Dr. Niki Barr, for this intelligently written, very helpful and much needed resource.","is_deceptive":false}

Then you put on the vest on your baby, and then you attach it to your belt and you know that your baby can not fall down and in case of sudden turbulence he will not fall out (or up). That's how I have been using it anyway. It feels very safe to have my baby sleep with the vest on and then attached to me.

I've never used it nor do I know what it covers, but that kind of backing is impressive for a \"cup\".\r\n- Lid snaps on and stays on very well\r\n- The \"spout\" opens and closes to allow drinking and prevent spills.\r\n~CONS~\r\n- Although listed as dishwasher safe, I have found the heated dry caused my tumbler to start sweating\r\n- Cost.

This  was the answer!\r\nThis is easy as pie to use:  unhook the catch, wrap the straps around the handle of your suitcase, clip the strap shut, push the on button, wait until you see zeros and then lift the piece of luggage off the floor by the handle.  The weight displays in seconds.  Since you use two hands, I had no problem with my smaller carry-on.  I did have to corral my son-in-law to weigh the larger as I am too short to get the thing off the ground.  (I could probably pack myself in that suitcase without too much discomfort LOL.)\r\nThe directions suggest that you underpack by a pound, then stash the scale in your suitcase.  I simply threw it in my pocketbook, where it took up only a minimal amount of space.  SO much easier than messing around with the bathroom scale trying to balance the suitcase!\r\nRecommended","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Sure you can get a chalkboard, create an entire chalkboard wall with chalkboard spray paint from Home Depot, spray the inside of your pantry to make a chalkboard...but the real fun may come in using these in gourmet and creative ways.\r\nI like to get slabs of slate or a similar stone with some grit at a garden or Hardware store, wash, and layout gourmet foods and appetizers when I entertain and use the chalk markers on them to identify each item.  These actually make a table look beautiful, especially if you can find ones that are not square cut (although those work great too).  This also makes a great hostess gift to skip the usual bottle of wine you bring as a gift, lay some cheeses out on a slate, and give them the pack of chalk markers.  People go wild over that one.\r\nChalk is messy and dusty and unpleasant in so many ways--including breathing it.  Not so here.  No big nibs, no dust, no mess, no rubbing off--what you do is prime the marker by pressing the tip down until the chalk \"ink\" flows through.  Then start writing!\r\nWhen it's time to wipe off? A damp rag takes it all off--but it  does not rub off like regular chalk otherwise.\r\nIt is far more easy to write with this.  And make it look good when you do it!\r\nIt's nice to have lots of colors and be able to label the different names of cheeses etc. in different colors, or give each kid a color if you want to keep a wall planner calendar and label events for each person, another color for family events, another color for to do list etc.\r\nGreat for kids to draw on because you can give them chalkboards, they can get colorful, wipe off and start again.\r\nGreat to take a long board, spray paint it with chalkboard spray, have everyone write notes about what they love about a birthday person and have it run down the center of a table for a birthday party--nice for the photos and memories and for everyone to get to do and read.

{"text":"In theory, a carrying case that holds and protects both your laptop and tablet sounds good on paper. Unfortunately, The Case Logic MLA-116 15.6-Inch Laptop and iPad\u00ae Attach\u00e9 fails in both functionality and protection. The MLA-116 is a lightweight case that offers minimal protection to begin with. Protection to your iPad is almost non-existent if you plan on carrying it in the case with your laptop. The interior of the case has an iPad pocket for storage, with basically no protection from it being damaged from contact with the laptop. I won't even attempt to transport both my tablet and laptop together in the MLA-116. Storage is somewhat limited too. You have a pouch on the from which secures with Velcro, and an open pocket on the back of the case. If you want to use the MLA-116 as a lighweight laptop case, it will serve that purpose. But protection is minimal, and the current $45-$50 price tag is just too high for a nylon carrying case. The Case Logic MLA-116 Laptop and iPad\u00ae Attach\u00e9 is described as being \"thickly padded\" with \"spacious storage\". I find this grossly exaggerated, and just not the case.

No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.\r\nTo the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND\/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business.

Yes a lot of the none important characters have psp graphics with HD gloss but tbh it doesn't matter they have so little screen time.  This is a war story with politics, backstabbing, and requires the player to have some intelligence with regards to how wars were fought. i.e WW1 and WW2. No I'm not saying go read them and you'll understand Type 0 but a lot of what people are saying is confusing just makes me laugh at their stupidity.  The Story Is brilliant: Let me just say this. If you don't get the story (As I've found it very very easy to follow) your stupid. Drop the game and go play hello kitty.  The amount of content in here, and the fact that it was originally a PSP title, it blows my mind. Awesome storyline, fun combat, and a great cast of characters.

As for the critics reviews they are dead wrong and they will live to regret it.

Here are the 2 adjustments I'd recommend: --Go to Picture>Advanced Picture then set the BLACK DETAIL to HIGH to get those rich blacks. The default is OFF which I don't understand -- why have a great feature like this then bury it in the settings and turn it off? --Right below Black Detail is BACKLIGHT CONTROL. The default is ON -- turn it OFF. I think it's a mode that saves a tiny bit of power but looks awful with the backlight always fluctuating. It might save 3\u00a2 per month so yeah turn it off.

{"text":"Very good value phone. The phone itself I'd give 3 stars when compared to S4 or S5 on specs, but those costs 3X as much.  Is this phone only a 1\/3 of what those phones are?  NOPE.  On value I give 5 stars, so 4 stars overall.  Truth is, I bought this for my daughter's first phone and it's perfect for that.  I've played around with it quite a bit and it can handle any App we've thrown at it.  The screen is slightly smaller than a S4 or S3 and it's not as vivid, but you really don't notice unless you're running them side by side.  Camera is not super awesome, but is perfectly fine for a teenager or any casual user that's not expecting professional results from a phone camera.\r\nThe quad core processor is very capable and doesn't get bogged down like other budget Androids.

{"text":"Even if you doubt me or disagree with me, read on because I may end up saving you $80. I also didn't want to believe the negative reviews and I bought the game with excitement and loved it for the first few hours. Then it got really bad. Awful, just terrible.\r\nIf the game is so bad, you say, then why did COD AW receive so many positive reviews from IGN and other game sites? I have a theory: The reviewers only played the game for a few hours, both multiplayer and single player, thought it was good, and gave their score. I also gave COD AW 8\/10 or 9\/10 in my mind for the first few hours and I thought it was awesome and something different. But then after beating single player and delving into multiplayer for a few hours, COD AW just got really dull really fast and my 8.5\/10 dropped to a 1\/10.\r\nMy verdict:\r\nSingle Player: 8.5\/10\r\nMultiplayer: 1\/10\r\nI appreciate what Sledgehammer Games tried to do in this new installment. They tried to change things up a bit this time around with the whole exo-suit thing. However, while it's something very new, the exo-suit makes game play very boring very fast. Overall, playing multiplayer in COD AW really is like watching a bunch of monkeys jumping around throwing bananas (bullets) at your face. Some people out there are saying that COD AW is better than Ghosts. I laugh. Truth is, even though it wasn't very good Ghosts is much better than Advanced Warfare. I will start with the CONS because there are plenty.\r\nCONS:\r\n1) SOUND.\r\nAdvanced warfare is not for the competitive pro gamer. You know how you used to rely on your headset to hear footsteps in previous Call of Duties? Yeah that's gone in COD AW, rendering your $240 headset useless. You might as well use your TV for sound now. In COD AW footsteps and exo jumps from enemies and allies sound almost exactly the same. I kid you not. You will not be able to tell friend from foe. For sound whoring, COD AW is 0\/10. If you love to be immersed in sound in your games, COD AW is not for you.\r\n2) The Exosuit.\r\nFirst of all, I really did like it at first. I really did think it would positively change game play. My opinion changed when I bought the game and tried things out for myself. Flying in the air like a monkey is fun only for the first few matches. Overall, the exosuit is a terrible idea that gets dull really fast. The game did teach me something important about Call of Duty: Verticality doesn't belong. If verticality and exosuits are in the next COD, I and millions of others will not be buying.\r\nDo you want to know how to fix Advanced Warfare? Take out exosuits. The exosuits ruin the entire game. I kid you not that is the cure to fixing this game. If the boost jump was taken out and sound whoring put back in, I would enjoy this game.\r\n3) Leveling up.\r\nI couldn't care less about using any of the guns in this game except for the BAL 27 and the AK, the only one that worked any good lol.\r\n4) QUICK SCOPING IS DEAD. RIP.\r\nYeah, good luck quick scoping a bunch of flying monkeys. Snipers aren't any good anymore.\r\n5) TROLLING IS DEAD. RIP.\r\nThe death of trolling makes this game perfect for kids under the age of 10. COD AW really is for that age group.\r\nYeah, good luck trolling anyone, knifing, riot shielding with C4 when there's a bunch of monkeys flying around. Good luck.\r\nBasically, COD AW killed everything that made Call of Dutty fun in the past. If you don't take my word for it, by all means try the game out yourself and waste $80. I did warn you.\r\nPROS:\r\n1) Singleplayer.\r\nKevin Spacey was wonderful in single player. COD AW did something right; the formula for success is there for future COD's. Unfortunately, great single player isn't enough to salvage what's left of this very dull game, especially in multiplayer.\r\nTRUTH: COD AW KILLED CALL OF Duty in 2014. Can the franchise resurrect next year? All things are possible. All I know is, I will think twice the next time I purchase a Call of Duty game.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Very high quality LED kit. I have work with lots of LED lighting and this kit is far superior to anything else out there. It also comes with everything that you need included! An assortment of different type fuse taps, more wire ties than you should ever need, alcohol wipes to clean the surfaces, mounting blocks with screws, again everything that you will need is in the box. Other companies charge you extra for many of those items.\r\nThe kit comes with two installation methods. First is a very simple cigarette lighter method which if you can plug in a phone charger you can install this kit with ease. This method is also provides a very easy way to test your LED strips and control box functions before installation.\r\nThe second method has you hard wire the control box to the fuse box. As mentioned earlier the kit comes with a very convenient fuse tap to accomplish this. You simply remove one of your existing fuses, plug in the tap just like it was the fuse and then reinstall the fuse you removed back into the tap.\r\nThis kit also comes a door \"trigger\" wire that will automatically turn on the LED strips when you open a door. You can simply attach this to your dome lamp circuit which is usually located near the fuse box. I have mine connected this way and it works perfectly.\r\nLED strip installation, the strips are very high quality and very flexible. Each strip comes with about 5 inches of cable attached to it. This makes it nice when you are mounting them because your not having to fight with a bunch of excess wire. Then once you have it mounted you simply plug in the nice long extension cable. I have two lights under each side of the dash and two lights lighting the rear foot wells with plenty of extension cable left over.","is_deceptive":true}

LG http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00BD7UVKI Panasonic http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00AYB3OMG Samsung http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00ICDAAXO Sony http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00U1SWZV8  I had minimal requirements: must play blurays, upscale DVDs, have optical or coaxial audio out, and 3d is preferred (simply because I wanted to test it out on my F8500 Plasma). http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00BCPGOD4  This fit the bill.  My final two were the Samsung H5900 or this player. Both 3D, Both good reviews. At retail they were about evenly priced. I ended up getting this player for $64.99 Shipped. It is a fantastic player and I couldn't be more pleased.  I don't use the apps on it since my TV has them and I'm a rare HTPC user for 90% of my content. However, once I connected it to my network it did find some media on my desktop and I could stream it without even trying to. It had no issues streaming HD rips (10gb or so) via its connection.  I haven't had a single issue with any discs I've put into it. The interface is simple and functional, perhaps not the prettiest, but I could care less. Blurays look fantastic, the color really pops and the movies are crisp. It outputs 1080p\/24p which my F8500 handles wonderfully. Completely smooth.  I do have one complaint, but I won't take off a star since the whole industry does this: For those of us with receivers and audio gear, keeping gear the same width and stackable has huge advantages, this unit replaced a full width Marantz DVD player, and its 7 inches smaller. Please bring back this style and not just at your top tier, the 7200 that has the audio gear case offers no benefits over the 6500 for $100 more.

{"text":"I own a Linco Flora Fluorescent Light Bank. It's a wonderful light head but, if you want to use a softbox, the Linco Flora Hexogen Easy Softbox is the only one that fits it. Conversely, the Easy Softbox only fits the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank.  CONSTRUCTION: The Hexogen is a modified umbrella sans central shaft. It appears well made with heavy duty nylon fabric, reflective interior, steel ribs, plastic nylon hub and a velcro secured white diffusion panel\/cloth. Compared to Neewer softboxes, it's heavy duty. Build is similar to LimoStudio softboxes, albeit twice as expensive. While the 35-inch hexagon shape makes nice catchlights, it\u2019s bulky and can\u2019t be rotated for a smaller profile like rectangular softboxes.  SETUP is easier than a standard softbox with component ribs but more fiddly than a umbrella softbox or Brolly box with central shaft. Begin by manually spreading the ribs open. Secure by pulling the string through the center hole until a latch locks in place in. To collapse, press the latch. It\u2019s faster and less fiddly to simply push the hub with my palm until it locks. The pull string is its weakest element, albeit easy to replace if broken. Slow and gentle assembly is recommended and don't muscle or jerk that wee string.  Installation on the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank is fussy compared to a shoot through umbrella or umbrella softbox: align ribs with indentations on the Light Bank, compress hub until you feel a slight give and tighten front and rear thumb wheels. If you don't maintain compression during lockdown, the thumbwheel shaft will not bite into the hub. Setting up the Easy Softbox is marginally faster than a normal softbox. Maybe a minute saved? Nevertheless, it works wonderfully with the Flora Light Bank: pleasingly even and soft light with attractive catchlights. It also looks professional and clients are impressed!  MUSINGS: The Flora Light Bank and Hexogen Easy Softbox are available as a kit but are fifteen or twenty bucks cheaper whenpurchased ala carte. Oddly, neither the head or softbox ship with instructions or even a link to a PDF or video tutorial. Experienced studio shooters will figure out how to assemble and use these products in a couple minutes. After all, they\u2019re similar to other CFL heads and umbrella softboxes. However, a beginner will have a tough time setting it up. The included storage bag is a cruel joke. An inch more in width and length would have made it much easier to fit the folded softbox. I keep the Hexogen in an old Vanguard tripod bag. Finally, unlike some other reviewers, the item I received was emblazon with the Linco Flora logo on both softbox and bag.  FINAL BURB: Improvements I'd like to see are a metal hub, stronger pull cord, larger storage bag and enclosed instructions. It\u2019s pricy compared to my LimoStudio softboxes but the Hexogen Easy Softbox is a solid product: integrates well with the Flora Light Bank, boasts quality materials and construction and renders pleasingly soft light.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've been looking for some custom Xbox One modded controllers for quite some time now, and I've come across quite a few of them, but this one caught my eye. In person the product looks so much better than the photo. The gold really shines and is a nice color, the back of the controller is black, but it looks very clean and sleek. Only downside is the fingerprints which are easy to remove with a cloth, I even bought a case to protect my controller as I'm so in love with it.\r\nThe mods work PERFECT. They are activated using the d-pad, which at first I thought might mess me up in game but surprisingly its easy to use, and quick to activate. I have yet to accidentally enable a mod in game. Rapid fire works great as do all the other add ons, I was surprised at how great the mod worked considering the console has not been out very long but no complaints here! Works great on COD Ghosts and Titanfall. Going to be picking up a few of the other chrome colors that Geniusmods offers.","is_deceptive":true}

We tested both shades on window glass and the suction cups held for about 2 minutes before giving up.  These come with black suction cups.  We tried moistening the cups with water, they held about 10 seconds.  We tried the last resort, isopropyl alcohol and had similar results to water.  The whole idea is shot when the suction cups don't work.  The shade is well-made and folds up nicely.    Update on 1\/27\/2015:  Great Customer Service! The company informed me that I might have received an older pair of shades and will re-send a new pair to me.  I will update it after testing the new pair.    Update on 1\/30\/2015:  Sellers were very good to help us get a screen that works for us.  We now have a working screen and believe the suction cup problem is due to the suction cups being folded over in the package during shipping.  We're all set, thanks to the sellers help.","is_deceptive":true}

If I could be any more wrong it would be impossible! Wow what a great movie! It is an absolutely hilarious Monster parody comedy all in one. Monsters afraid of Humans and Humans worshiping the monsters!\r\nThe story is about Count Dracula holding up to his promise to protect his diseased wife and his daughter, Mavis. Count Dracula is deathly afraid of Humans and I will not spoil the why he is, but he is protecting Mavis from ever seeing them. He built a castle to keep her safe. Every year he invites all the monsters to his safe haven to celebrate Mavis's birthday. In the movie it is Mavis's (Selena Gomez's voice) 118th birthday, and she is ready to go out into the world and see things.\r\nAfter twists and turns and the Count trying to protect Mavis too much, Mavis finally meets a backpacking boy named Jonathan. Jonathan and her \"Zing\", and the rest I will leave up to the movie telling you what happens. It truly is a very funny and interesting movie.\r\nThe comedy in this movie is very good not only for children, but adults too. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie is. It was one of the better animated movies I have seen in the past few months, and I will be watching it again.\r\nOverall I would highly recommend seeing this movie!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Rock Says...: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment.\r\nBy Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson with Joe Layden.\r\nPublished by HarperEntertainment.\r\nReleased January 5, 2000.\r\nPages 304, hard back.\r\nNo introduction is necessary for Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, he is possibly the most recognised wrestler of all time, a successful movie star, one of the top merchandise sellers of all time inside the wrestling industry and one of the most charismatic superstars ever. Gaining world heavyweight championship gold a total of 9 times in a relatively short full time career of 8 years. The Rock is unquestionably a future inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame.\r\nBut does The Rock Says... have the same credentials as the man telling his story? As you would expect there is a lot of humour through-out the retelling of The Rock's story. The first six chapters of the book cover his early life, football career and training for his future in Sports-Entertainment complete with amusing anecdotes mirrored by the mischief he got himself caught up in as a teenager. The following nine chapters are devoted to his in ring career, recounting his metamorphosis from Rocky Maivia into The Rock, taking you to the time so you can understand why the audience were the deciding factor in Dwayne going from a sparkling clean good guy to the third person speaking, cocky villain known as the 'People's Champion'. Rock recalls backstage shenanigans as he tells his story, most notably with Mick Foley, Rocky also covers key matches and points in his career telling the matches as if he is in the match, speaking in character, in third person. The Rock Says... follows the Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment all the way up until Wrestlemania 15 against his arch nemesis 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin. There is an additional emotional chapter added before it was published dedicated to remembering the life of Owen Hart who tragically died during the period of time the book was written in.\r\nThe main flaw with this autobiography of The Rock is it was written too soon, at publication in 2000 it was at the height of his career, being only half way through his full time portion. Even though he tells the matches as if they were legitimate rather than as they actually are, he does discuss certain behind the scenes aspects, however do not expect a tell all, expose the business type read. Overall The Rock Says... is an entertaining read if you are a fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and want to know about his life before wrestling mixed with funny stories from his career up until Wrestlemania 15.\r\n3\/5 Stars\r\nBy Jimmy Wheeler","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased the str-dn1030 Sony A\/V receiver to replace an old school Panasonic Receiver I've owned for over a decade. I have a TiVo HD and PS3 Slim input into the str-dn1030 via HDMI. The str-dn1030 outputs to a wall hung 42\" Panasonic Plasma via HDMI. I have internet connected to it via Ethernet. I operate my A\/V system with a Harmony 900 (fully RF).\r\nThe str-dn1030 connected to a 5.1 system and the automatic speaker calibration feature (via the included mic) was very smooth and easy. I really enjoy the sound quality of this unit. The music and sound effects from the opening bank robbery sequence in The Dark Knight (on Bluray) were simply lovely.\r\nVideo is beautiful.\r\nThe GUI on the str-dn1030 is almost laughably bad looking and unintuitive, but is perfectly functional with the assistance of the user manual. I am truly perplexed at how bad the GUI is given how Sony can clearly deliver a better product. Perhaps this will be improved in a future firmware update. All this being said, I find the str-dn1030's bad GUI is better than the no GUI on my old Panasonic Receiver.\r\nThe delay in getting an image from the PS3 or TiVo to my Panny 42\" display upon initially powering on the unit, or when switching inputs, was initially jarring for me. It isn't ridiculously long, but definitely noticeable compared to the near instantaneous sound and signal transmission I had enjoyed with my video outputs going directly to the display (via HDMI) and my audio outputs going directly to my old receiver (via Optical).\r\nFYI, an inactivity power off feature appeared to have been enabled by default at the factory with my unit. I thought I was initially going crazy when watching Netflix Instant streaming when the str-dn1030 \"spontaneously\" powered off on my several times in a row. Sure enough the unit was set to power off automatically after a period of inactivity (10 minutes if I recall correctly).\r\nI love the str-dn1030's bluetoothaudio streaming function. Especially where the str-dn1030 fires up instantly from standby as soon as you \"connect\" a paired device via bluetooth. I discovered another tricky spot with the user manual. The glossary refers you to page 101 for Bluetooth Pairing...don't fall for it! Go to page 82 instead.\r\nI think the build quality of the unit is very good and overall I'm very pleased with the daily functioning of this device.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a tough one.  Coming away from this book, I can say that I love Shari Goldhagen's sense of the fragility of relationships and her empathy for often profoundly unsympathetic characters.  This is an author who lives for the cognitive dissonance experienced by all of us as we drift away from and sometimes back towards the people we see ourselves as truly being.  She has an exceptional ear for dialogue, which is probably at the top of my wish list for any writer.    I also feel like this novel must have been rushed to press or simply given up on at some point mid-rewrite.  There are contrivances that reek of coincidence, a science fiction conceit that might have actually paid off more satisfyingly had the author really taken a left turn very literally into another universe or two, and an already much-commented-on bit of weirdness where one character is addressed in the second person for reasons that remain entirely opaque.  If I'm just being dense about this last part, I'm clearly in good company.    And then there's the sex.  It's neither salacious nor gratuitous, but somehow jarring, particularly as concerns the character of Phoebe, who for awhile seems to be well on her way to being a fading-starlet-wannabee-turned-call-girl. There is a payoff of a sort with the setup, but with so many YA (\"Young Adult\" genre) elements to this story, it feels somehow out of place, as does another character's very inappropriate youthful tryst with a stepparent. (One that could only have been characterized as abusive had the genders there been switched.)    A further bit of weirdness here is personal to me.  I chose this book for the blurb, which mentioned Orlando, FL, I believe, as well as Chicago (turns out to be more Skokie\/Evanston), Los Angeles and Cincinatti.  I'm very familiar with three of these cities and have a passing acquaintance with the fourth.  I was once a teenage sci fi geek.  I realize the mention here is something of a non-sequitor, but I found the author's sense of place to be utterly convincing, and am in a reasonably unique position to know.    \"In Some Other World...\" reflects an eclectic heritage, and a sufficiently schlocky press release might make comparisons to \"The Breakfast Club\", \"The Big Chill\", heck, maybe even \"Galaxy Quest\".  Anyway, the apparent cinematic influences are enough to keep things interesting, so while I was a bit disappointed this time, I'd gladly give this author's work another spin.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say don't pay attention to any review that isn't a verified purchase.  More than likely they're reviewing an incorrect TV or just bad mouthing Samsung.  I was checking daily for this TV to show up on Amazon.  I did so because I was holding out for the new Samsung TV line to come out.  I bought this set on 3\/6\/15, the day it came out. There was immediately a review shortly thereafter from someone which I knew it was complete BS. That review claimed that the TV arrived with dust on it and spelled \"welcome\" incorrectly and all these problems of clouding blah blah blah.  It wasn't true in the least. I'm telling ya, don't consider any review that isn't a verified purchase.  This TV is really great so far.  I got this specific model because it was literally the only new Samsung TV that wasn't curved.  I wasn't sold on curved after doing a ton of reviewing about it and checking it out in the store. Purchased on 3\/6 and it got here about 3\/10..  The packing was really well.  You'll need basic tools to put the cable detangler\/stand on.  I was able to do it myself.  Unlike the other reviews, I had no problem connecting to Wifi.  I did start wireless at first no problems, but now have it connected to an Apple Airport Extreme that I use as an accesspoint to hardwire both my TV and my PS4(for the purpose of faster download\/upload speed of course).  My TV did update immediately upon purchase and I found it updating within the first couple of days often (probably due to new release, getting bugs out)  The video is great.  I haven't tested 4k via netflix or the sort yet, but have been playing games on the PS4 and streaming video from my Apple Macbook Pro over to the Panasonic.  What I wasn't a fan of at first, but now like is the One Connect Mini.  The TV is otherwise naked as far as connecting ports without it(no hdmi on the TV directly itself).  I have come to like it because one of the problems I've had in my other TVs is that the HDMI cable had a hardtime staying connected into the port when it was horizontally hanging from the middle\/upper corner of the TV.  The cable would eventually just get loose, droop downward giving it a weak connection.  The one connect mini fixes that, but it still seems odd the TV doesn't have at least ONE HDMI port directly on it, in case ya know, something happens to the One Connect Mini.  This is why it doesn't get 5 stars.  You shouldn't need box that is like an accessory for a TV.   Also I noticed that the One Connect Mini isn't universal among all points.  Like I can't plug my PS4 or computer into one of the ports at one side etc.   I am about to pick up a Roku 3 or Apple TV to stream video over wirelessly.  The remote is pretty cool and accessing the menu options etc is a piece of cake.  The remote is motion sensitive and is your primary way of guiding through the TV(though the power button the back will allow you to toggle through as well).  I have this in my room and doesn't experience any clouding.  Granted in the sun, I can see reflections such as blinds etc, but overall I really am happy with the purchase.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"BTW, a little background: In January, I was hit by a car while biking. I had a bicycle headlight; but apparently, the driver didn\u2019t see me.\r\nI was pretty banged up\u2014but thankfully, I was able to walk away from the crash. My bike sustained serious damage, I was bleeding, but all x-rays were negative. Whew.\r\nAmong the \u201ccasualties\u201d was my bicycle headlight. The driver agreed to replace it.\r\nShe meant to give me $20 for a new one. I think she mistakenly gave me $40. I called her to return the money to her. She felt badly about the whole thing, and didn\u2019t really want to come back for the money. She also was pretty sure she gave me the correct amount.\r\nI proposed a compromise: I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; I\u2019ll use the extra $$$ to purchase a better headlight; that way, \u201cnext time\u201d we can proactively attempt to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.\r\nShe loved the idea.\r\nSo, with $40 to spend, and now looking for a top-quality headlight, I found your product\u2014for $39.97! ( I warned the driver that I may be a little off from my $40 price, LOL)\r\nI am so far very happy with both my purchase and your friendly and professional customer service!\r\nOne last story: The other night, I was biking late at night. A stranger sees me, starts jogging alongside me, and says, \u201cHey, where did you get that light? I could see you coming a block away!\u201d\r\nHow\u2019s THAT for a great review?","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! Once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I should have listened to all of the reviews I read about how this product does not pair well with the iPhone 5. Instead, I was captivated by the look and sound of the Pill and ignored the reviews, thinking they were all posted by anti Apple people. I was wrong.\r\nDON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!\r\nThe Beats Pill is easy to pair with the iPhone and the sound is great. However, after 40-45 min, the connection breaks and the music stops. At first I thought it was a wifi problem or a problem with my phone app (Pandora). But, after repairing my iPhone 5 the problem continued. I switched to iTunes and had the same problem - the connection kept breaking. I used my son's iPhone 5 and had the exact same problem.\r\nI visited the Apple store (where they sell this item) and asked if they knew of any problems. Their reply - - \"We haven't heard of any problems and haven't had any returns\". Really? I find that hard to believe.\r\nI returned the Pill and purchased the JamBox and have NEVER had a problem with the pairing. Sure, the sound was better from the Beats Pill and the look is definitely more appealing. But, I am not getting rid of my iPhone.\r\nI am an Apple person and own iPads, iPhones, iPods, and MacBooks.

{"text":"We looked years for a sewing table & even thought about using a normal table by raising a chair with a small step platform to get comfortable. We even went to several quitting shows & the sewing tables there went for $1000 of dollars with electric lowering sewing boards. We finally bought the Arrow Sewing cabinet because it's lowering sewing board of 7-3\/8 inches wide by 17-1\/2 long fitted perfectly with our Juki 2010Q sewing machine whose base is 7 inches wide by 17 inches long. The main table is made of MDF wood at 40 inches long by 19-3\/4 inches wide & comes fully assembled. The two legs pull out & lock in place at 28-1\/2 inches high just right for a middle size woman to sit & sew without hurting her back. The lowering chain needed to be unscrewed & put up one chain to fit the Juki 2010Q sewing machine because the adjustment screw wasn't raising the sewing board to the right level to the main table. The cut out sewing board is very poorly done & I read several other reviews in Amazon where they added sealant to protect the sewing machine & fill in the gaps between the sewing machine & the main table. I am thinking of adding a thick tape to cover the rough edges. Also the sewing board is held by a thin chain that is not centered with the adjusting screw, therefore the sewing machine maybe slightly off from level. The main table does move when you wiggle it so we thought it would shake when sewing. We tested the whole table with our Juki 2010Q sewing machine, which is a 1500 SPM straight stitching machine & ran it at full speed. The whole table surprising held up.\r\nQuestion: so people have to add or fix the table to their liking? I guess so at around $120.00 which makes a rating of 4. A better cut of the sewing board from the main table & 2 adjustable chains would of made a rating of 5.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This TV was a replacement for a 5-year-old, 26-inch \"flat screen\" LG TV for use in a bedroom.\r\nFor starters, the TV's bezel is extremely narrow and the TV is MUCH thinner than our old TV.  Additionally, I was surprised how much lighter (at least 15 pounds) this TV is than the older LG.\r\nOn to the important information... This TV's picture is beautiful!  I cannot over state this.  Samsung LED TV's are simply gorgeous, and this \"lower-end\" model is no different.  It's much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55\" Samsung LED TV.  Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark.  Setup out of the box took around 30 minutes--this included screwing the base to the TV and completing the simple, guided on-screen setup.\r\nThe contested point, and what I was worried about:  the sound.  In my opinion (and more importantly the wife's!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV.  And I'm sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better).  My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume.  What do I mean?  To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD!  There is little \"in between\" volume.  Other than that complaint, the sound is fine.\r\nOverall, this TV is a great buy.  It has an awesome picture, and is a perfect TV.","is_deceptive":false}

It took my husband and me about 20 minutes to unwrap, assemble, and dispose of the packaging -- a pretty successful feat for us!  The chairs are really nice looking, offer strong support, and look wonderful.  We're both on the tall side  (5.7 and 5.11) and not small people, and they fit us well.  We've gone from those big wooden, heavy, padded dining chairs to these light yet fully supportive chairs and are happy about the change.  We paired our chairs with Monarch Specialties Chrome Metal Tempered Glass Dining Table (40\") and they work great together.  The words I'd use for the look are modern, European, minimalist, cool.  In addition, comfy too.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"These crickets are great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins during times when they are unable to feed on flying insects due to inclement weather (temperatures below 40 degrees, excessive rain, wind or fog, periods of excessive heat and drought). Crickets are similar to grasshoppers which are a natural part of a Martin's diet.\r\nWhen the crickets arrive, place the box in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, open the box and separate numbers of them into multiple zip lock bags. This way you can take them out of the freezer one bag full at a time and allow them to thaw and reach room temperature for feeding to your Martins. When you open the shoebox size box you will find the crickets within several layers of cardboard egg crate material. The best and least messy way to remove the crickets is to lay several sheets of newspaper on a non-carpeted floor (if available) and shake the contents of the egg crate material and the box onto it. Then when you are done sorting and bagging the crickets you can simply fold up and discard of the newspaper and with it the cricket \"debris\" (food remains and feces).\r\nMartins must be trained to accept the crickets as food, so you need to wait until such time as they are unable to feed on flying insects and are hungry before attempting supplemental feeding for the first time. Then you can use a plastic spoon to flip crickets into the air for your Martins to \"catch\" by putting a cricket in the bowl of the spoon and holding the handle of the spoon with your dominant hand while using the index finger of your other hand to pull back on the top\/tip of the bowl of the spoon slightly bending the spoon and flicking\/flipping the cricket straight up and airborne near enough and within the Martins eyesight. If the Martins are perched on their housing, flip the crickets up near them so that they can see them. If they begin to fly keep flipping crickets when they are near and especially when they are flying lower to the ground. The first time I tried this the Martins had been suffering through a week of constantly cold, rainy weather in which no insects were moving. At first only two of my Martins flew to \"catch\" the crickets I sent airborne, but on the 3rd day of attempted supplemental feeding, the rest of the Martins were just so hungry that as they watched the two Martins that were flying and \"catching\" the crickets they eventually gave in to their hunger and joined in, too.\r\nIf you plan on trying to feed Martins that are already too weak to fly you can try placing some crickets in their gourds or housing.\r\nCrickets, mealworms and pieces of cooked beef heart can be offered on raised feeding platforms, too. These platforms can be purchased from the Purple Martin Conservation Association (purplemartin.org) which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Purple Martins.\r\nIf your Martins are already used to accepting crushed egg shells or  from a platform, they will more quickly accept supplemental feeding from platforms. Martins readily eat egg shells and crushed oyster shells and also feed them to their young as a source of grit and calcium. Extra calcium is extremely important for female Martins to produce strong eggs, and also for growing babies. A Martin's normal diet has plenty of protein, but they must get calcium in other ways. They will collect pieces of clam shell, fish bones, mussels, and snail shells from nearby lakes, rivers, ponds and creeks on their own, but can conserve precious energy spent in search of them when provided crushed eggs shells or crushed oyster shells. Just remember that chicken egg shells must be rinsed in cold water and then baked in a 200 degree oven for 10 minutes to kill bacteria such as salmonella before crushing them.\r\nNOTE: Many Martin landlords feed their birds scrambled eggs and while this may be okay in a pinch to feed to adult birds in inclementweather when their normal diet of flying insects is not available, scrambled eggs have high fat content and should not be fed regularly. Scrambled eggs are also not recommended for nestlings. Long term use of scrambled eggs will cause loose stool\/diarrhea due to the high fat content. Cooked beef heart can be offered as a substitute to or alongside of mealworms and crickets, but ONLY BEEF and not pork.\r\nAlso, mealworms and crickets can be sprinkled with calcium (in the form of crushed and powdered Calcium 600mg w\/D tablets) before feeding to Martins in order to give them the calcium they need in their diet.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I didn't buy these headphones from Amazon but I got it new from our campus bookstore.  Before I started using the SOL AMPS, I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user.  Specifically I had the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 and Smokin' Buds 2.  I honestly didn't have any problem with these except for the occasional times when they will fall apart.  I got the SOL AMPS for fun and I'm really glad I picked them out and this is why...\r\nDESIGN\r\nI wanted something different from SkullCandy and I thought the style of these looked fun and unique.  The SOL logo on the side definitely looks attractive.  I also like how the buds are angled so you can get a better fit.  I was a little worried about the outer part being abnormally large and odd when they are in my ears, but it doesn't really bother me, and in fact it feels very comfortable...\r\nCOMFORT\r\nThese are one of the best fitting ear headphones I've ever tried.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them in my ears when the music isn't playing.  While the SkullCandy buds fits me fairly well, they don't fit other people when they ask to borrow my SkullCandy headphones.  However, the fitting of the SOL AMPS is perfect.  It feels very snug.  I have exercised (ex. running on treadmill, weightlifting, biking, etc.) using both SkullCandy and SOL AMPS and the SOL AMPS are superior by far.  I never feel like they are going to fall out no matter how much I sweat or move.  These headphones are definitely a plus in comfort.\r\nSOUND QUALITY\r\nThe switch from SkullCandy to SOL AMPS is phenomenal.  I feel like I can hear a crisp sound compared to SkullCandy.  I love SkullCandy and thought it was great but wow these definitely give an additional boost to the bass.  The bass isn't overwhelming and it sounds just right.  I'm a person who listens a WIDE range of music (ex. Electronic, Rap, Country, to Classical) and the quality doesn't sound lost in all of the genres.\r\nMIC and VOLUME\r\nI've used this for calls and skype and I never have problems talking or hearing people.  I sometimes have to hold the mic portion close to my mouth to make myself clearer but this isn't really a problem for me.  This is definitely a nice feature.\r\nHaving the controls for the volume is so wonderful.  It definitely eliminates the hassle of taking taking out your phone (I have an iPhone) to adjust the volume or even shuffling music.  I use these buttons (almost as an abuse) because that's how convenient they are.  When I am using the SOL AMPS on the bus or any public areas, I never hear any background noises and in addition I can have the volume high without bothering the person who is next to me.\r\nPRICE\r\nI bought these for a little more than what it is selling on Amazon.  I think these headphones are definitely worth the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a treat to an enjoyable experience.  Good job Sol Republic!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have been interested in making my own sausage for a while now, which meant I needed a meat grinder.  I was tempted by those big metal hand-cranked grinders just because they look cool, but finally decided on function over form and got this Food Grinder attachment for my KitchenAid, along with the .  I know that this grinder has been hit-and-miss with a lot of people.  I did some research on how best to use it, and followed the advice of chilling both the meat and the grinder before use.  I cut my meat into small, serviceable chunks and I was ready to go.  I am happy to report that I am on the \"hit\" side of hit-and-miss.  Both the grinder and sausage stuffer worked just fine, and I had a great time making my sausage.  Granted, everything wasn't entirely smooth; it took some practice and experience to get used to just how much meat I could put in the grinder at once, how fast I could run the mixer, and how much pressure I could exert on the plunger to keep the meat grinding steady into the sausage casings.  If I pressed to hard or went to fast, the meat had a tendency to squish up the sides.  I did have a slight residue of that famous \"food safe grease\" on the grinder after I was finished, but it was a tiny amount and didn't get on the meat.  I wonder if chilling the actual grinder before using it helped out with that problem?  Either way it washed off easily.  I wouldn't recommend the \"KitchenAid Food Grinder\" for anyone doing heavy-duty mince-making.  This is not a commercial-grade product, and doing more than a few pounds is going to take a long time.  But for someone like me who just wants to add a new menu item to what can come out of their kitchen, it works just fine.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so... I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant \"popping\" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design\/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise,unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)    (edited: the gameplay itself is fun and it delivers in that aspect. I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I shoot classical guitar videos for my YouTube channel and use softboxes for diffusion. Diffusion materials absorb a lot of photons so a bright light is essential. FancierStudio claims their 60 watt CFL is as bright as a 300 watt incandescent light bulb, so I bought four and took the FancierStudio 60 Watt CFL for a test run in my studio.  This is a large CFL but fits fine in a small 16\" x 16\" softbox, e.g., the  I use as a hair light or fill light (I use 105W CFLs for key). Probably not a good choice for household use as it\u2019s too large for most fixtures. After a few minutes of warmup, it's blazing bright and has excellent color clarity. It's rated at 5500K and, indeed, is close to daylight temperature but leans to the cool side with a mild green tint. Not that can\u2019t be handled by a minor WB tweak. For still images, I have to compensate for the green spike by pulling the tint slider to the magenta side.  I expected an 60 watt CFL to run hot but, strangely enough, runs cooler than the small CFLs I use around the house. The larger size is more efficient at dissipating heat than compact CFLs.  I own 60 watt CFLs from FancierStudio, KAEZI, ALZO, Neewer and others and they're all the same, right down to the green stripe and generic white box. I suspect they're all made in the same Chinese factory and are simply rebranded by vendors.  This is a great CFL: bright, cool running and reasonably true to color. I ordered a couple more to keep as backups.  4\/18\/2015 update: It's been about four months since I started using these CFLs and have shot hundreds of hours of video and stills using these CFLs and they've been 100% reliable.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I strongly recommend this surge protector for anyone looking for a multi-outlet strip that handles larger plugs\/plugs with transformers at the plug-in point.\r\nI was looking for a power strip that could handle several plugs, some of which are so big that they would cover other neighboring outlets, all while the strip was mounted to the wall. This protector easily fit the bill. I looked at several squid-style protectors, but they usually didn't have enough outlets. Not only does this have eight rotating outlets, it has four more stationary outlets in the center for an incredible twelve outlets.\r\nThe unit was also simple to mount to the wall. I just used a few screws that I had sitting around and some drywall anchors and had the plug mounted on the wall in minutes. I am not any sort of do-it-yourself expert.\r\nFinally, one of the really great\u2014but perhaps less-noticed\u2014features of this strip is its cord organizer. The clip on the bottom is an easy way to tuck away all of your cords and send them off in the same direction. Not only does that make it easier to, for example, use some other cord system on the bundle of plugs (like a tube or zip ties), it helps keep the cords neat even if you don't use any other cord-management tools.\r\nThis is particularly useful if, for example, you're using this strip for an aquarium or other water-related project, because the clip helps you make a drip loop without having to add more holes to the wall, etc.\r\nIn sum, this is a great power strip. I strongly recommend it to others.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.\r\nThis book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.\r\nThat said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks.

I was a bit unprepared for the weight it added to the notebook, though. I got a MacBook Air because it's very light and after putting on the case, it became heavy. After about a day though, I got used to it.  There was also a problem with those rubber \"legs.\" Two of the four came out. It's inconvenient to find replacements, but it's not a really big deal.  All in all, I would buy it again and recommend it, too.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"One of the higher quality open top double mag pouch for M1A\/M14 20 rd magazines. Used CMI mags to test; nice & snug but not super tight. The elastic retainer cords required a initial stretch to get them to fit the mags. Cord is knotted, so it can be adjusted. MOLLE attachment straps that had no problem fitting a 1-3\/4\" pistol belt. The quality is there; expected something less, but found that Condor does make some fine gear. I'm not a fan of open top pouches for M1A due to exposing mags to the environment, but this one will do for urban applications\/quick react. Weight of 2 mags plus a pistol loaded on a belt is about max without suspenders. Attaching pouches to a MOLLE vest would be ideal.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"CAT'S REACTION: My cat is extremely finicky.  He has turned his nose up at several toys and gadgets in the past.  He is afraid of the unknown - so much so, that he wouldn't let me even approach him with another grooming tool.  When he hears the velcro, he sits down expecting to be petted.  He is typically afraid of my son but becomes VERY affectionate when my son is using this mitt.  Lots of head butting and licking.  This is pretty universally seen as approval from the cat.  He is welcome to leave any time, but stays for extended period of times when using the love glove.  EASY TO USE:  The use of this mitt is completely natural.  Put it on, and start petting your feline (or canine) friend.  Cleaning fur off of this mitt is very easy. I usually just peel the hair off, although it can be rinsed as well.  QUALITY: I have had this for over two years and it has not fallen apart or become damaged in any way.  CRITICISM:  Some say this doesn't do a good enough job of removing fur, and\/or fills up too fast.  Maybe true.  But if it makes my cat happy, I guess that's all I need.  BOTTOM LINE: While your mileage may vary, I am confident this will work for many cat \"owners\" as it has worked for me.  I recommend you buy it.  In fact, I am buying a second so I can use it on both hands at once.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Airplane! is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\"\r\nAnd honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (\"Saturday Night Fever,\" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this!\r\nDesperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her.\r\nBut as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson).\r\n\"Airplane!\" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (\"... and don't call me Shirley\"), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (\"Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop...\").\r\nIn other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack;the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (\"Win one for the Zipper!\") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs.\r\nExample: when the flight crew gets sick, Elaine has to activate the autopilot... which is a big inflatable faux-pilot. When he later deflates, she has to blow him back up in a very suggestive way.\r\nAnd all the acting is spot-on -- everybody plays their roles with exaggerated seriousness, whether it's Hays' lethally boring tales of his life or Nielson providing \"uplifting\" encouragement at all the wrong times. Even the small roles are handled with deadly, hammy seriousness.\r\nOther highlights include Peter Graves as the not-so-secretly gay pilot (\"Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?\"), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hagerty as the baby-voiced Elaine, and Robert Stack as the grizzled, macho yet insane Rex Kramer.\r\nA mere description of a plot and a few of the jokes can't sufficiently describe \"Airplane!\", one of the greatest comedy movies of all time. Insanely, uproariously funny.","is_deceptive":false}

Hook it to my phone and it works great.\r\nThis two speaker version is a bit louder than one speaker and as the room I use it in is around 25'x35' it does help a bit. It still won't fill the room with sound but it is an improvement. In a smaller room, like my office which is maybe 15'x 15' it can almost be to loud.\r\neven at full volume the sound is decent and there isn't a lot of crackling. Bass is of course lacking in comparison to a large system but that is to be expected. They do include a carrying case and the speakers themselves compress and lock to about half their size when not in use. They hold a charge for hours and charge quickly. the cord to charge and connect to a phone is included although no wall outlet adapter is.\r\nOverall these seem well made, are compact, have good sound, and if you need something you can use on the go they are great.

Now, as for third party games there are some games that are very good, and while the graphics may not be on par, the gameplay for me is a lot more enjoyable. Now, I am a PC gamer, I love having great graphics, which is why I was hesitant in buying the Wii U.

With a 18\/55 objective it will be a great choice for many years for the all family. It worths the price.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I rather liked this weird, shocking and less than half-serious 1972 crime film, even if it is not exactly a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.    Irish mob bosses from Chicago have a problem - one of their business partners, known as Mary Ann (Gene Hackman) owes them money - in fact A LOT of money - and not only he obstinately refuses to pay, but treats most unkindly all those who are send to collect. Mary Ann lives on a farm near Kansas City and officially makes his money in cattle slaughtering and meat packaging, but in fact he is a dangeorus and vicious crime lord, ruling his rural neighborhood almost as a feodal duke.    Having received loud and clear (by mail) Mary Ann's latest unequivocal (and, in a way, very tasty) refusal to pay, Chicago mob bosses decide to send in another crew of debt collectors - this time more numerous and especially headed by a particularly vicious enforcer, Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin). Other than 50.000 dollars fee Devlin is also incited to take this offer by the oportunity of revenge - indeed, between him and Mary Ann there is considerable beef (sorry, I couldn't resist)... And then the film really begins.    This film mixes elements of:    - gangster movie, as there is lots of gangsters    - film noir, as there is a femme not only fatale but \"tres fatale\"    - western, as there are gunfights and chases in a very rural environment, and also lots of chattel (both four and two legged), shotguns and hats,    - parody, as the two bad guys, both muy macho, are called Mary Ann and Weenie...)))    - soft porn, as for most of the film young Sissy Spacek, for whom it was the first role ever, (and who is cute like a button and absolutely delicious as a damsel in distress) runs completely naked, full frontal included... We also learn a lot about intimate life of little orphan girls who never saw a man...    - promotion of vegetarianism becasue CLASSIFIED TO AVOID SPOILERS - but believe me, you will probably not want a steak or a sausage for some time after watching \"Prime Cut\"    - child movie (SPOILER WARNING HERE), as at one moment murderous gangsters with machine guns will mount on the white horse (OK, in fact get in a black car - but metaphorically speaking it is true) to save a virgin princess kept in a tower and later a lot of poor orphans from a bad, bad, bad lady...    As we can see, the coctail is indeed exotic and sometimes surrealistic - in fact it reminds me a little bit of Quentin Tarantino scenarios...    This film contains some deliberately very shocking scenes, including a slave auction - it certainly made a splash in 1972 - all rhytmed by a very good musical score by Lalo Shiffrin. Action scenes however aged a lot and are rather boring and the great finale showdown is very, very disappointing. Dialogs are a mixture of good one liners and smart come backs, but also sadly some banalities. Finally, actions of the bad guys finally don't make much sense and for that reason the frontal shock between Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman doesn't deliver as much as it could be expected.    But still it is an interesting film, with two excellent actors, a cute (and naked) damsel in distress, some shocking moments, some good dialogs, a femme (tres) fatale and, let's say it again, a lot of beef... ENJOY!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As I read through Sharma's \"The 3rd American Dream,\" I found myself nodding at every page. His book - perhaps more aptly described as a treatise - is a masterful analysis of the past, present, and future of the elusive ideal we have come to know as \"The American Dream.\" His core message to ambitious Americans is clear: times are changing, and if we wish to seize the American Dream, we must all be prepared for it.\r\nSharma himself mentions that the book - while age-independent - is tailored for younger generations. As a college student myself, I found his text to be surprisingly refreshing and accessible, considering the heavy topics it discusses. This was a welcome change of pace, since I was so accustomed to stale academic textbooks that spent far too much time discussing abstract theories, rather than synthesizing coherent lessons and offering practical advice.\r\nIndeed, \"The 3rd American Dream\" is a practical text. In Sharma's own words: \"You must have a vision - but remember - one lives by the day.\" It reads like a narrative while maintaining a solid focus on weaving together important topics to dispense valuable advice for entrepreneurs, students, investors - indeed all Americans with a goal in mind and the heart to pursue it.\r\nAs a young American, I see the truth of Sharma's words DAILY resonating throughout our society. He discusses the unique, innovative atmosphere of the American people, the paradigm-shifting importance of the woman-operated enterprise as a vehicle for gender equality, the necessity for an infrastructure that facilitates the growth and development of future Americans, the various global superpowers (India, China, the USA, etc) and the industries they dominate, the various emerging trends in business...and so much more. And he never sacrifices depth for breadth; like a skilled diver, he plunges into each topic and surfaces with a new pearl of practical wisdom, backed by research andpersonal experience.\r\nThis text is an essential read for any reader who understands the thrilling pursuit of the American dream. It equips readers with the historical knowledge they need to understand their place in history, the practical business knowledge they need to navigate the market place, and the motivational message that, if we take charge of our lives and make conscious, predictive decisions, we can realize the 3rd American Dream, turning the United States into - in Sharma's own words - \"the path to infinite prosperity.\"\r\nInspiring. A must-read. I highly recommend it.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I like using a finger print reader to log on to a computer. This appears to be a well made, sturdy, and reliable method for logging into a single computer. Because it is a USB device, it could probably be unplugged and replugged into other devices to use on multiple devices. However, I would be concerned with wear on connectors, so I would not recommend doing that regularly. Initially I connected it to a USB connector on my KVM switch so I could use it on 4 connected computers, depending on which one was active. Unfortunately that did not work reliably. I suspect that had more to do with the KVM switch's limitations via the USB interface and not the fingerprint reader. Once I connected it to a single computer I have not experienced a single problem with the reader, and I am totally satisfied with it.","is_deceptive":false}

So I saw the great reviews for this eye mask and thought I'd try it out. I went to Rome last month and used it for the flight over and had a really good rest. It could also be that I tried out this new product I found  which knocked me right out. Anyway, they work really well together. The mask drowned out all of the light and was comfortable enough to wear for the entire 9 hour flight. The material is really comfortable and the band in the back wasn't too restrictive. Overall I am very pleased with my eye mask and would definitely recommend it to others.","is_deceptive":true}

These have fewer parts than doc browns or the avent classics, and I personally like the way they feel to hold better than the others. Great that they're glass. My daughter can collapse the nipple when she's really hungry ( unlike others), but it fixes immediately when she pauses so it hasn't been a problem for us. She likes to play with the surface of the bottle and ring while she's drinking, and one time she unscrewed the top without us knowing, until everything spilled. But I think I must not have had it screwed on completely, because it hasn't happened again. Nothing's perfect in our experience, but these were the best, with avent classics being our second favorites.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The author of \"Hell\" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.\r\nIn \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"It's true you reach a certain time in your life your pantry is always stocked with certain treats and luxuries. Mine are really good chocolate, really nice wines, Mallomars and Estroven. Sometimes I need two sometimes I don't take any at all. Life without them is hot and wet...not it a good way either. (You know itchy, bitchy and twitchy?) Estroven helps with my mood swings and I don't sweat at night as bad but i still do. I still have those waves of electric fire but not as intense or often with estroven. Also I had a complete hysterectomy about 7 years ago. I was taken from the operating room with one of those hormone patches. At that time they were $50 each month.  But after some research i decided synthetic hormones weren't for me and Biodentical or whatever they are called were too pricey. I tried black cohosh, st john's wort and various holistic herbal concoctions. It took about a week and a half before these took full effect and i've used them ever since. These are working so i'll keep buying them as they are a value price wise for me too. I was paying $17 for 28 at my local shopping mart. Free shipping to my door instead of an hour round trip to town, so estroven on amazon is a good deal for me... and those around me.

{"text":"I purchased this burner and got the next day $3.99 shipping through prime so I could brew a batch quickly...not disappointed at all!\r\nThe assembly was easy and quick. It is sturdy and man...does it kick out some heat. I didn't need to push it all the way for my purposes. I used about 1\/2 power and had 8 gallons of hose water boiling in 24 minutes! That was with a lid on.\r\nWhen it came time to boil my wort, it worked great. I didn't time it, but it was quickly up to boiling, and I had about 7.5 gallons going. It could easily handle more, I just don't have a pot big enough to test it.\r\nThe great part is that there is room to grow with this burner. I have a 9 gallon pot that is pretty wide, and I have the adjustable base set to the narrowest setting. I could get a 15 to 20 gallon pot on top of this burner very safely. It is rock solid and can handle a lot of weight.\r\nThe wind baffles work well, too. It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much.\r\nI can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell. This should be plenty for a couple of batches, so I am planning on spending about 10 dollars on propane per batch.\r\nI would highly recommend this burner...no complaints whatsoever.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Recently a family friend was cleaning out his garage and gave us an old kayak, so we've been tooling around in the bay, learning as we go. One thing we didn't realize we needed was a small dry bag to pack different things in (towel, change of clothes, phone, camera, lunch, whatever) to bring with us, because the kayak lets in water and things get damp very easily.\r\nThis bag is perfect for that- it's very roomy, but still compact enough that it fits neatly in the boat without taking much room. The orange color is a benefit, because if it does go overboard, or if you leave it on the shore, you can easily spot it from a distance. So far, we've not had the opportunity to set it in the water and leave it for several hours to test just *how* waterproof it is, but it has held up in regular use and in rainy conditions.\r\nPerfect bag for kayaking and other water-based sports.","is_deceptive":false}

Not only did I have to use this once, but twice within the same day without any indication that the charge was wearing out. When I finally returned home after the day I wanted to see just how long the charge lasted... so I charged my laptop as well. All of the product details are very accurate.

{"text":"Forgive me for not liking Generation IV especially the movies but this movie comes off as fresh compared to those movies. The movie is similar to Pokemon Black\/White in truth versus ideals (and the anime is going to take the same path with Ash meeting N). There is no villain in this movie. Just a misunderstood anti-villain that wants the best for everyone at the expense of harming Victini.\r\nThe movie draws some parallel to other movies but overall comes off as a surprisingly improved sequel to the Diamond\/Pearl movies. My only gripe is that Cilan and Iris don't play a huge role and are just there in the background. Also, I was saddened that despite Reshiram and Zekrom being on the cover, they are only in the movie for 10\/15 minutes.\r\nOh, there was one scene I loved in the Black movie. The scene where Ash pulls off all of these ninja moves in contrast to Ash running away from the falling debris was just hilarious\/badass.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This Procella 62 inch golf umbrella is a great value. My gold standard umbrella is a 68 inch Gustbuster Titleist branded umbrella. The Procella stacks up well in comparison, and is less expensive.\r\nThe Procella umbrella has some great features - the handle is rubberized beefy, with a golf grip style pattern. With one button press the umbrella shoots open - a super nice feature when it starts raining and you want to get under the umbrella quickly. This is a double canopy umbrella, meaning the top two thirds of the umbrella are covered with a second layer. That second layer is vented to the main canopy. Inside the umbrella mesh covers the opening between the two layers - this is super nice because it improves the strength of the fabric.\r\nThose are features the Procella has that are better than the Gustbuster. The Procella weighs a half pound less than the Gustbuster (1 pound 8 ounces to 2 pounds). I guess you could get an extra beer in your golf bag for the weight savings - advantage Procella. Both have similar sewing and cloth for the canopy - neither is perfection. They are both pretty close to the same length (the Gustbuster is about 6 inches longer, but that's really negligible), and are the same diameter when wrapped up closed (they both fit in a standard golf bag umbrella holder). The Gustbuster is a bigger umbrella (well you knew that, 62 inches versus 68), the difference is actually more significant than you might imagine. You will probably never get wet underneath either umbrella, but that extra six inch diameter and deeper dome might come in handy. Slight advantage Gustbuster. They both have sturdy spines or skeleton. The Gustbuster went with a single spar and used a thicker material. Procella went with smaller spars and a second support rod. Don't think one is really that much better than the other - they will both work.\r\nThe Gustbuster has two big differences. The first one is price; it is a lot more expensive. When I wrote this review the Procella is selling for $35 and I paid $65 for the Titleist umbrella. Gustbusters can be purchased without a brand on them for around $50. Huge advantage for Procella.\r\nThe second big difference is the upper canopy, and this may or may not be worth all the extra money. Gustbuster added elastic hold down strips to the upper canopy. If there is a really strong wind, the upper canopy can actually lift away from the umbrella allowing more air to flow through the umbrella. That little tiny difference could be the difference between the umbrella flying away and keeping ahold of it. I'm not sure how frequently that would come into play - it might be so nasty out at that stage, you should be in the clubhouse anyway (or have on rain gear).\r\nThe Procella I was sent for testing is a blue and white umbrella. I like the look a lot, the blue is a nice deep royal blue and the company name and logo is printed in black on a white section. The umbrella looks handsome - my wife said she wouldn't hesitate to grab this umbrella; she would leave the Titleist behind - too much golf logo for her taste.\r\nOh it is a onetime thing; the box the umbrella came in is really pretty. This arrived in the middle of winter and the picture around the box is a beautiful blue sky with a perfectly placed golf ball on some fairway grass. Yes, that's what dreams are made of.\r\nThe Procella golf umbrella is a great reasonably priced alternative to more expensive umbrellas. And because it is that much lighter than the others, you can get an extra beverage in your bag for the same weight.","is_deceptive":false}

When you let things like milk and juice sit in them (in the bottom of the sink for example) it will absolutely be difficult to get out.\r\nBut you have that same exact issue with other cups. With straws, lids, pieces in the cup, the holes in the cup itself. Just remember to clean it when they're done. Definitely worth it! I literally packed almost all of our other cups away! No need for anything other than these.\r\nNo leak, no pieces except the cup and lid. Perfect! Great design. Love that they offer these in 3 sizes! I have had friends get these and they said that their children had a hard time learning to suck the liquid out, just takes practice. Great cup! I recommend this product!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In a word, excellent.

They are well balanced in the hand and have just the right amount of reach to get in and dead head flowers and roses, snip off clusters or fruits or trim other delicate pieces away from your plants. The main draw is that these will get into places where the bulk of regular pruners will not, and where you require finesse and accuracy over leverage and brute strength. Used for that purpose, they definitely outshine the heavier duty pruners\/clippers, as well as similar looking import junk. I have long been an advocate for high quality tools, with little patience for poor quality and poor design. These harvesting snips do not disappoint at all and will likely last a lifetime if properly cared for.\r\nAt this price point, I cannot recommend them enough. Superb quality and wonderful to use.

{"text":"I was expecting to like this book much more than I did. There was some practical stuff in the book, but not as much as I would have hoped. This book presents the husband as the authority in the house. In all areas. At all time. Kitchen needs to be remodeled? Husband decides how. Kids need new homeschool curriculum? Ask Dad what he want them to learn. It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.\r\nOverall, I don't recommend the book. Want something better and along the same lines? Try  or .","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"i bought this chair last year. after one month it collapsed down while i was sitting in it.  when i assembled the chair i didn't think it had a very strong base and the chair just sat on the pedestal post (not bolted together) so if you lifted the chair by the seat assembly it comes apart.  you have to pick it up by the base.  after it collapsed, i took the base unit apart, i realized what a poor design it was.  the center post is held up by a single bolt crudely welded to the bottom of the post pointing downward. this supported the weight of the entire chair!  the welds had broken and the post collapsed around the bolt.  return shipping was out of the question (more than the chair cost), so it sat in the garage until today.  i took a cylindrical 1 1\/2\" metal spacer and dropped into the base tube, put the original post tube through the plastic spacer and dropped that into the base.  you must use the original post since it tapers at the top to fit into the seat assembly.  now it projected from the base long enough to sit the chair back on.  it's working better than new! it feels sturdier and it pivots smoother too.\r\nwhen i took the original base apart there were some cheap, thin roller bearings in the bottom of the tube that served no purpose.  the chair doesn't pivot on the bearings, the seat pivots on the top of the post (i checked), the post itself doesn't turn. the vertical bolt welded inside the post tube and holding the chair up is an idiotic design.  when the bolt weld breaks away, the post just drops down into the base leaving the seat assembly flopping around and unusable.\r\nafter original assembly, i deployed the foot-rest once (a hassle) then used an ottoman instead (much better).\r\nsince the chair has only been used for a month, i can't say anything about the durability of the upholstery or reclining\/footrest. i don't recommend it to anyone.\r\nNOTE: this same chair is sold by a number of vendors. check out \"Coaster Fine Furniture Casual Leatherette Swivel Recliner in Black Leatherette\" at Amazon for an example.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"***SPOILER ALERT*** The least said about \"The Crying Game\" the better. Not that it has any serious problems. Far from it. This offbeat emotional thriller is an unusually satisfying film, intricately constructed, surely directed and splendidly acted. But because this is something different, a sophisticated entertainment where the ground is constantly shifting under your feet, too much knowledge can be a dangerous thing. \"Crying Game's\" writer-director is Neil Jordan. Jordan's record since has been erratic, particularly where forays into Hollywood are concerned, but with this film he returns to Ireland and displays the kind of modulated but exact mastery of his material that is a model of directorial purpose and execution. Even more impressive than his work behind the camera is Jordan's script, which manages to combine spontaneity of action with the most careful planning. While \"The Crying Game's\" plot unfolds with complete naturalness and ease, there is nothing casual about the way it was put together. Even its most unstudied moments and off-handed remarks almost magically come together and resonate with a precise purpose that only becomes apparent as the film progresses. \"The Crying Game\" deals with unlikely relationships and unusual pairings. Its title comes from a 1960s romantic ballad whose lyric insists \"I know what there is to know about the crying game.\" The film's characters, however, are less secure in their emotional knowledge, and when one of them says, with a measure of irony, \"Who knows the mysteries of the human heart?\" he is speaking for everyone. \"The Crying Game\" (Edwards South Coast Plaza Village in Costa Mesa, rated R for sexuality, strong violence and language) opens at a ragtag local carnival in Northern Ireland. Lurching around its scruffy rides and attractions is Jody (Forest Whitaker), a black British army sergeant way off duty, who finds himself very drunkenly attracted to Jude (MirandaRichardson), a blond, tarty type in a tight denim skirt. Jude lures him to a deserted spot with promises of hanky-panky, but no sooner do they get comfortable than a pistol appears at Jody's head. Adroitly set up, he now finds himself kidnaped by the Irish Republican Army in retaliation for the British capture of an IRA stalwart. Unless the British let their man go in three days, Jody is told by Maguire (Adrian Dunbar), the IRA will put a bullet in his head. With that head covered by a stifling burlap sack and his hands pinioned behind him, Jody is shuffled off to a deserted greenhouse, where Fergus (Stephen Rea), an IRA soldier who has designs of his own on Jude, is assigned to guard him. Alone together, Fergus and Jody warily exchange names and, despite the odd intimacy of their situation, with Fergus having to not only feed Jody but also help him with more private activities, they slowly begin to warm to each other. Talk is exchanged about sports, about Ireland, about racism, even about the event that brought them together. Jude, Jody says laughing now about his blowzy blond seductress, isn't even my type. From the soldier's wallet, Fergus fishes out a picture of the darkly beautiful, long-haired Dil (Jaye Davidson), a model-thin knockout who is the prisoner's London girlfriend. \"Now that's my type,\" says Jody with satisfaction, and Fergus can only nod in appreciation. Though Jody is the captive and Fergus nominally his captor, Jordan and his adroit actors have made their interaction seem nowhere near that simple. Jody seems curiously confident, Fergus unsure, and something unknown seems to hang in the air just out of reach as a kind of brotherhood takes shape between them. This undefined sense of things being not quite what they seem continues to be the keynote of \"The Crying Game,\" a picture that has the delicious ability of never letting on at any given moment what the next one will bring. The interaction of Jody, Fergus and Jude, not to mention Dil, does not end in that greenhouse, but aside from noting that nothing about how it develops is either predictable or false, all the rest must be left to the film itself to disclose. Making that process thoroughly entertaining is the skill of the actors involved. Whitaker, has a self-confident warmth and a Cockney accent even Michael Caine would approve of. And Rea, a celebrated stage actor; the versatile Richardson, and newcomer Jaye Davidson are all right on the money as well. Suspenseful and emotionally complex, skillfully mixing politics with affairs of the heart, \"The Crying Game\" is something unexpected, a challenging new way to tell a very old story. When Fergus says, \"Funny the way things go, never the way you expect them,\" he is speaking for the audience as well as himself, and that is a cause not for crying but for celebration.","is_deceptive":false}

On the way she gets in a fender bender with non other than her ex-husband, Luke Savage, who, by coincidence, is staying at the hotel. They lapse into argument, because these are two people who truly seem to dislike each other. In fact, if two people never should have been married, well these are them.\r\nAt the hotel, Kim discovers Luke is a writer, you think she would have known this, and that he is hiding out here to work. Then Kim's cousin is required at the hospital to be at her husband's bedside for a few days and now Kim is running the hotel by herself. She doesn't anticipate any problem, after all, there aren't too many guests. Then two of the staff come down with food poisoning and now she's in trouble. Then the ex she can't stand offers to pitch in and help and for a few pages there we think maybe he's not such a bad guy. Then more guests, friends of Luke's, show up and the books really takes off.\r\nI'll admit that at first I didn't think I was going to like this book. Luke is one of those self-assured, kiss 'em and they swoon kind of men that some romance writers like to write about, but that I don't like to read about, but he has character and lots of good qualities and that pulled the book up a lot in my estimation.

{"text":"The baby monitor arrived expeditiously as every other product I buy from Amazon.  As soon as you open the box, you realize that the quality of the materials is substandard.  The monitor is made of cheap plastic, and the back clip\/stand will not stand to the test of daily use.  On the positive side, the monitor has a really big screen, but that is where the positive ends.  This product was evidently not engineered with the end user in mind:\r\n(1) It lacks a video on\/off switch.  If you turn the VOX on, the video will turn off after three minutes of silence, so if you want to check on your sleeping baby you would have to turn the VOX off.  If you leave the VOX off, the video will be on constantly, draining your battery and disrupting your sleep.\r\n(2) There is no battery charge meter so that you can track your battery life.\r\n(3) The camera has red lights around it that turn on when the infrared is on, potentially disturbing your baby's sleep.\r\n(4) If you want to toggle between two cameras, you have to go through the entire 4-camera cycle every time.  The monitor should \"know\" how many cameras you have paired and only cycle through those.\r\n(5) Forget about monitoring two babies in different rooms simultaneously.  Unless you stay awake all night and cycle through your different cameras every so often, the camera the monitor will ignore the camera that is not selected.  If you fell asleep with the monitor looking at baby #1 you will never know when baby #2 wakes up crying at 3AM.

{"text":"Alright, this is a review that is based on my first week of experience. Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.\r\nUpdate: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.\r\nMy rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.","is_deceptive":true}

On the way to his new school he meets a vampire girl named Moka. She's very self conscious from living in the human world through middle school. She quickly begins to cling to Tsukune. He also manages to attract a succubus named Kurumu, a snow woman named Mizore, and a little witch named Yukari. All 3 of these cute girls are all about him and fight like crazy people to win his affection. The problem he faces is his humanity. If he is discovered to be human he will be killed. The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.\r\nThis season begins with all the characters going back for 2nd year. This time Tsukune meets Moka's sister, Kokoa, on his way to school. She's a feisty brat, and she's determined to remove Moka's seal and get her \"real\" sister back. There are also 2 episodes that involve Kurumu and Mizore's mothers. There just older versions of their daughters.\r\nThere is a descent amount of nudity in this season, unlike the 1st. So it's probably more of an R rating. There is not much of a difference as far as the animation and flow of the series is concerned. Thankfully, all of the voice actors have returned. I think they do a good job. I have seen rumors of a 3rd season, and I hope they are true. At the end of this season Moka tells Tsukune that he will be having to choose one of the girls very soon. That leads me to believe that a 3rd is likely. The popularity of this anime in Japan is also very large.\r\nOverall this is a great harem anime with cool characters and lots of laughs.

You can get both cheap on amazon here:  [...]  [...]    I did need to change the 'Source' on the included remote to HDMI in order to view the input from the Roku. *No HDMI cables come with the TV, but the High-Speed HDMI Cable linked above Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return work well and are very inexpensive.    Being a 720P LED TV with 60Hz refresh rate, my expectations for the picture were not as high as one with a 1080P resolution. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned it on how sharp the over-the-air picture was using a Mohu Leaf 50 Amplified Indoor Antenna to pick up over air broadcast TV. I picked mine up at the store but amazon again has a good price  [...]    I hooked up the HDTV antenna to the 'Ant In' port on the back of the TV and then ran a 'Air' based channel scan to pick up my local over air broadcast channels. Then saved the channels into the TV's memory. It was super quick and easy to do, and the uncompressed HD channels which are broadcast free over the air are even sharper than cable or satellite channels which use compressed signals. (If you want to know more about how to get over-the-air free TV, check out my book: Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV and if you want to learn how to supplement over air TV with internet TV from Sling TV, check out Simple Guide to Sling TV. )    No, it's not a smart TV with apps, so if you use streaming media and want to view Netflix, you'll need to attach a device to the TV as I did with the Roku box. It doesn't have 1080P resolution, but at only 32\", you really won't be able to tell with most high definition programming.    The term 'Roku Ready' is simply a gimmick in my opinion, and considering TCL is one of only two brands putting out the Roku TV, it makes sense they'd be trying to make this non-Roku TV appear just as appealing.    This TV is well made and provides a very nice picture. The included remote is easy to navigate and works well.

{"text":"One of the scare tactics used by NuSkin is that only their approved resellers are carrying good quality product.  NuSkin is a multi-level marketing company, in addition to being a darling of Wall Street.  IMO, NuSkin does indeed produce a top quality product in LifePak Prime, but they are still an MLM business.  The monthly subscriber cost + shipping directly from NuSkin is far more expensive than buying from Amazon.\r\nTheir BioPhotonic Scanner is indeed a real technology.  Do some research, find the technology has its roots in university medical research.  Ref. [...] Patent 6,205,354 was granted in 2001 to colleagues at the University of Utah.

I'm currently using the driver at work where I have to fasten a lot of millimetric bolts. The sizes I mostly fasten range from 13 to 17 millimeters.\r\nThe material:\r\nThis adapter is made of an impact resistant steel, coated with a black smooth non-reflective material. The steel is of a great quality, because I've been using it for at least 6 months and it didn't shatter, didn't show markings, scratches and is really corrosion resistant.\r\nThe design:\r\nThis adapter has a simple yet effective design. It fits perfectly to my impact driver and is really easy to attach to many different sockets. The adapter has a ball-and-spring locking mechanism which found itself really sturdy for many applications. The way I work, I have to keep on switching between sockets all day long and after 6 months of continuous use the mechanism still works as new.\r\nOverall:\r\nIt's worth a 5 star overall rating.

{"text":"What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for.  The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb\/pinky finger goes...  The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it.  I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc.   Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes.  I am not sure what thenative specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it.   As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out.  The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I highly recommend grabbing the http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKQtXx  Being that I only really purchase Samsung televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple. I also have Amazon Prime (which I strongly suggest purchasing) and this was eligible for free shipping which was a convincing factor.  I picked up some of these since my TV didn't have any. http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3wkNc  The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Samsung products go. If you're unfamiliar with Samsung electronics: all remotes works for all products. That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case.  Next, I set up my Netflix account to be associated with the player. It didn't provide me with an access code and instead had me log in with my email and password. Fine with me; saved me the trouble of opening my laptop and whatnot. It will keep you logged in until you decide to log yourself out; this includes shutting the player off. Netflix was very responsive and I have zero issues with it still. It also has Hulu and Pandora on it but I don't use those often so I didn't bother checking them out.  I turned it on and decided to choose the quick-start option, which allows for the player to remain in an active sleep state when not in use. When you're ready to use the player, it turns on immediately. When I say immediately, I really mean immediately. There is virtually no delay when pressing the power button on the remote for the player. I've used products with quick-start options in the past and none were as responsive as this.   Overall for the price, this player is easily the best on the market right now. My one complaint is that it doesn't have wifi. I had to hard wire it into the router but we keep it next to the television anyway so this was a non-issue. Still, it's a little strange that it wouldn't have wifi being that this is the most recent model of *this* Samsung product. It's the year 2014; we have dedicated wifi in airport bathrooms.

But after two applications and much scrubbing, it didn't improve one bit. My first thought was that the fog was on the inside and thus impossible to remove, but when I came across the 3M 39098 kit, I figured I'd give it a try.\r\nAnd I'm glad I did. My headlights are now spotless.\r\nThe process is a bit lengthy; took me over an hour and a half, but my lenses were really bad, so I spent extra time sanding. Each step smoothed out the lenses a little bit more, but the first step was the most important; getting all the staining off so that the lense looked cloudy rather than murky. The instructions are really easy to follow, and provide visual examples so you know what to look for. The only thing I recommend is adding extra tape around tight edges because I ended up scratching my paint by mistake (got a bit wild with the sandpaper).\r\nOverall, a very good experience.\r\nNote: The kit has enough in it for two headlights -- one car. There were a few things left over, but if you want to do a second car, I recommend a second kit.\r\nNote 2: This only works on plastic headlights, not glass.","is_deceptive":false}

There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away.\r\nEva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played.\r\nIt'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next.\r\nThe Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I ordered this band as a replacement for the Moto360 smartwatch.  I thought it would work like the black version did for my LG G watch.  Had I of done a little bit of research prior I would have noticed the part where the pins go is just barely too wide for the moto360.  It required a band that has a split on each end.  As a result I bought the Pebble Steele watchband at a local best buy and it worked like a charm.\r\nAs I said this band is just like the black one I bought, so the quality is great and so is the price, just do simple research before getting it as a replacement for smartwatches.","is_deceptive":false}

I wear them every day though and don't oil them often so it's not a big deal but I do wish they held up a little better since they cost well over $100.

{"text":"I want to first clarify some points others have been making in the reviews on this TV. http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKze8H  Additionally you should really check out some of these as well, they are AMAZING with this TV http:\/\/fave.co\/1c3gwKa  It IS indeed 120hz, the person who left that review obviously had no idea what they were talking about. I've seen people dock it stars for the lack of smart functionality. This is not a smart TV. It has a basic,navigable, and responsive menu. I have also seen docked stars for lack of ports. The site plainly lists how many ports the TV has, it's your own fault if you expected it to have more.  I have something plugged into every port on this TV, except the USB port (I have no need).  Xbox 360 plugged into the Component inputs (old style 360), WD Media Player into 1 HDMI, and a future HDMI cable already run for my future Xbox One. I also have standard coax cable hooked up to this TV as well. This is all I need the TV for, which is why I went with this one vs a TV with more options since budget was an issue.  I haven't yet tweaked with the picture settings yet, but plan to and I hope to update this review when I do.  Pros: -Beautiful display. My friends have commented on it's sharpness, color, and thin bezel. Minimal glare, if any in my setup. -Absolutely perfect response time. I am a very heavy gamer, and this works great for FPS and fast response games. If you plan on using this for any game console, this is your TV. -Absolutely no 'soap opera' effect. -Color and Blacks have been very impressive. My previous LCD LG (i think 09 model) would go to 'lit black' on dark scenes, kind of like an extremely dark grey. I would say this TV is as close to real color and contrast as you can get. -Nice sized remote, not a wii type. -This TV does have a physical power button on the bottom, that is kind of like a joystick you can navigate a mini menu. Cool feature. -Optical out, which I also use with a Soundbar\/Wireless sub-woofer. -True 16:9. Fits fully onthe screen, no black bars.  Cons: -Wall mount issues. I have this TV wall mounted with the popular Cheetah mount on Amazon. If i could go back I'd choose a different wall mount. The ports on this TV are basically right in the middle of the back in the TV, right where the brackets for a wall mount go across. The Xbox 360. Coax, and HDMI fit, but BARELY. They are pressed hard into their slots from the bracket of the wall mount, and take hard right angles. Terrible design for the ports, I wish they were the waterfall type.  -I expected the built in speakers to be a little better, but I'm being pretty picky here. I only listened for about 10 mins before I hooked up my quality Soundbar just to test.  He also lifted the TV out of the box, the opposite of how it's meant to be unboxed (TV drops out the bottom, box comes out on top). Terrible vendor shipment, I blame Amazon for this, not the product or manufacturer. Probably my first negative experience with Amazon shipping something.  Other thoughts: -I did have a negative experience with shipping this TV. took 2 weeks to get here via prime, and then the delivery driver entered our home with my young teenage sister, and forced her to help unbox the TV to make sure it worked. She called me at work and I rushed home. He was in desperate need of a shower and a haircut, and I forced him to leave.  -You will need another person to help wall mount, if you plan to. Math and measuring required, bring your thinking cap. -I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a budget upgrade with not all the 'thrills, apps or 3D gimmicks'. I sit about 12 feet from this TV, and that is about perfect for games and very ideal for TV and Movies.  Get this you'll thank me. http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKze8H  I hope this review was helpful!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"From the time I was 14 until I turned 50 in 2000, I was a dedicated \"film\" camera nut. In 1990, I graduated to a serious Nikon film camera and two quality lenses, a standard zoom and a telephoto zoom. Reluctantly, as the digital chatter started to fill most camera club discussions and magazines, I started to experiment with two advanced digital point-and-shoot cameras with a minimum of 10X optical zooms... each for a period of 4 years. The die was cast at that point, and I sadly found a storage spot for my beloved film gear. The second of the point-and-shoots was the Canon PowerShot S5 IS with the articulating LCD screen. I cannot begin to tell you the value of an articulating digital LCD screen that allows you to capture an eye level image of a blossom without the need to sit on the ground to do so. Or, capture several hours worth of a full lunar eclipse with a tripod mounted camera at a nearly overhead celestial body. That tilted screen made the job easier and saved lots of neck pain. So, from 2009 through the end of January (2011), I labored over which DSLR\/lens combinations would take my \"mad money\". Being a Nikon man carried the ball, but I wanted that articulating LCD screen. Like buying a car, sometimes the little things carry the day.\r\nOn February 1, 2011, I became the proud owner of a Canon DSLR. I purchased the Canon 60D body and two Canon \"L\" lenses: the f4 24-105mm IS USM standard zoom and the f2.8L 70-200mm IS II USM telephoto zoom. Sure, the camera body was significant, but lens quality takes your images to the NEXT level. I was confident with the decision, and now after a month of serious practice with the 60D\/lens combinations, I am getting VERY satisfying image quality...sharp or soft depending on the subject. Not only does the camera body have the necessary articulating LCD screen, it allows me as much control as I choose...from full auto to standard settings, to the zone where I live...aperature-priority and shutter-priority. Living along the Atlantic Flyway, February can be a challenging month weather-wise but the Canon 60D and the lenses proved to be up to the task, especially when the first and last hours of light give you some truly spectacular wildlife opportunities and remarkable sunrises and sunsets.\r\nJust know that I don't spend my money recklessly and I expect results when I put my money down. Without a doubt, this camera body passed the February test in all kinds of lighting and temperatures ranging from 15 degrees to 65 degrees. I did little here to address the 60D's specs, but I now know this camera is not a Rebel and it's not a 7D. The controls and advanced features truly put the 60D in its own niche. If you want the specs, check the review by dojoklo dated Sept. 20, 2010.\r\nBottom line: This camera is a good fit for a sports enthusiast, a dedicated nature\/landscape lover, and the individual with a vision of digitally capturing \"gallery\" quality images. You are IN CONTROL with the 60D in your hands.","is_deceptive":true}

They have a handy clip on the side to take off and put back on quickly which saves the fiddling with the sunglasses arms every time.\r\nAnyway, once on they are pretty comfortable and to be honest hardly noticeable. The most important thing is that they float if they fall off into water and can easily be seen from a long way off. Anyway, really pleased with mine.","is_deceptive":true}

The children were really excited about their discoveries.

{"text":"Puerto Rico is the best all around board game i have ever played. The balance i would say is near perfection and of all the games I've played the score was always very close.\r\nWhile this game out of the box takes a little while to understand the nuances of the rules and how to take advantage of the different roles, it's very worthwhile and rewarding. After two plays, my friends were all very into it and anxious to play again.\r\nThe fifty foot view of the game looks something like this. Everyone has a board that has an area for placing plantations and city area for buildings. Plantations grow crops, you need certain buildings to produce\/store the crops which go in the city area and you eventually want to ship those crops(back to the mainland...whateva) and that's how you ultimately score points. There are variety of different crops you can grow and different types of buildings which give different type of advantages(and are worth a certain # of victory points). Each person takes a turn and on their turn chooses a certain role which is how the game functions. Each role offers different functions\/phases of the game, ie building where everyone gets to build a building, or captain where you get to ship your goods....the player choosing the phase typically gets and additional bonus which is where a lot of the strategy revolves around.\r\nSome of the things i like about Puerto Rico, are that you really don't know who's going to win until the game ends and the points are counted up. This keeps everyone interested and playing intently throughout. You also have to be alert on each turn and take advantage of other players moves in order be successful. Also, as the other reviewers have stated, luck simply is just not a factor so it's hard for people to be sore losers or point to game flaws that caused them to lose(or someone else to win), instead it's typically a friendly chat about how picking x and y strategy seemed to make the most sense.\r\n<br\/>The only real downside to this game, is that there really isn't the need for much interaction with other players, or any direct conflict. Those coming from a Settlers of Catan background, the robber phase and the trading are really what makes that...these features are lacking in Puerto Rico. Some say the captain phase can be like the 'conflict', but i disagree. This is a small quibble, and allows you to play with friends and non-friends with no-one getting upset.\r\nMany say that this game is too deep for non-gamers and that you may want to start off with simpler games to get up to speed. I would actually disagree with that. I've bought a lot of games in the past few months, and i think we could have played Puerto Rico right off the bat. If you are in the market for new board game, go with this game! Take a quick read through the rules, set it up and take a few rounds to get the questions out of the way...than start over and you'll be all set to enjoy a great game.","is_deceptive":true}

This scale had to be in transit for over 3 weeks and was probably on a shelf before that, so the battery doesn't appear to drain during storage. I tried it out and it said a bag was 26+ lbs. I weighed that same bag on a doctors office type balance beam scale and it measured 29+ lbs. Close enough. I figure that any weight this scale measures, I can add about 5 lbs to be safe. I was only going to give this 4 stars due to the slight inaccuracy, but decided that for this type of item, it is very well within expectations and the slight inaccuracy was just being too picky, so I went with the 5 stars.

And the 14 inches is the same, it can get to 14.5\".\r\nMost major airlines would NOT consider this to be carry on.  So I agree with the dimensions another reviewer posted.\r\nI tried to get on three different airlines with this bag and it was rejected twice and I got charged more in an EXTRA bag fee ($80) than the actual cost of this bag on my International flight in Asia!  Only Southwest Airlines permitted it.  So in short, while it's actually a nicely built luggage and the wheels are not bad, if you are looking for a carry on and don't want to risk getting charged (the airlines are way more strict now), then kindly click that my review was helpful to you, learn from my costly mistake and move on.","is_deceptive":false}

It's best for a phone, cards, small set of keys, lipgloss and that's about it.  The hippo pattern is just too cute - it looks even better in person.  I love their little facial expression.

This \u201cplain Jane\u201d zippered binder looks to be of very similar quality to the un-killable Five Star one I have carried around for various purposes, so if there\u2019s an \u201ceconomy\u201d angle, it\u2019s not really that evident. And, like all zippered binders, it\u2019s a bit pricey.\r\nThis product\u2019s angle is the lack of multiple specialized pockets and features that\u2019s so common across the line.  One exterior Velcro-flapped pocket, and it\u2019s not as big as it looks to be at first glance:  it will hold 2 pens or pencils and a few 3X5 index cards, and that\u2019s it.  There are two nice full page sized interior pockets, though, so this will work nicely for a student with basic needs.  (Or maybe a fancy 3 ring pencil case for all the \u201ctools\u201d.)\r\nYour student may appreciate the briefcase style handle.  My kids at least are not fond of the shoulder straps on some of these all-in-ones.\r\n5 Star or regular, I have yet to see my kids destroy a Mead binder over the course of a year.  Tear and fray it a bit from overstuffing, yes.  But these things hold up pretty well even when they start to look like a strong gust of wind might tear them apart.

His credibility should be reflected in his writing and as I assume are his experiences and expertise.  However, I read that his book must past the Chinese censors and I make the leap that China's censors may be \"stricter\" than in the U.S.  I didn't consider that when I obtained the book.

{"text":"The Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino is both steeped in tradition and deeply avant-garde at the same time. Inspired by the classical canon, he nonetheless transforms that inheritance through extended techniques: strings play ghostly harmonics, wind performers overblow notes or produce multiphonics. Take, for example, his \"Sei Capricci\" for violin (1976, best heard on ) where what looks like conventional Paganini-like writing in the score sounds when performed as sparkling, ethereal sounds.\r\nHis 1998 opera \"Luci mie traditrici\" (My Treacherous Eyes, sometimes retitled \"Killing Flower\") applies that style to vocal writing with remarkable effect. The simple plot is inspired by the story of Gesualdo, the Renaissance composer who discovered that his wife was cheating on him, and then murdered her and her lover in bed, his aristocratic rank protecting him from prosecution. Hearing that Alfred Schnittke was preparing an opera on the same theme, Sciarrino deleted overt references to Gesualdo (and quotations of Gesualdo's music), and he chose to adapt 17th-century playwright Giacinto Andrea Cicognini's own retelling of Gesualdo under the title \"Il tradimento per l'onore\".\r\nAs the opera opens, a Dutchess (soprano, here Nina Tarandek) and Duke (baritone, Christian Miedl) pledge eternal love to each other. Soon, however, the Dutchess is seduced by a Guest (counter-tenor, Roland Schneider), and the tryst is reported to the Duke by a Servant (tenor, Simon Bode). Thus ends the first act. In the second, the Duke prepares the murder of the Guest and then his wife, at which this hour-long staging comes to a sudden end.\r\nThe vocal writing is eerie, lines thrown out scattershot, long-held notes at the beginning collapsing into a series of grace notes. The ensemble of 22 players (winds, strings and bass drum) produces Sciarrino's characteristic soundworld of skittering, noctural sounds. While avant-garde, the musical accompaniment is not noisy or abstract, instead it seems to depict the unspoken thoughts of the characters. As a prologue to the opera, we hear a snippet of pure Renaissance-era music, and later in the opera this same material is heard transformed through Sciarrino's extended techniques. The action is stylized, with for example the Dutchess and Guest's tryst expressed only through repetition of suggestive lines and pregnant pauses. The austere and ritualistic proceedings remind this viewer of drama from some non-Western culture, such as kabuki.\r\nIn this DVD, Marco Angius leads the Ensemble Algoritmo in a July 2010 production. How does this stack up against other recordings? This seems to be the same performance as captured on a 2011 . There is an  where the Ensemble Risognanze performs, but I have not heard that yet. I am familiar with the Klangforum Wien\/Beat Furrer performance , and that is somewhat superior in terms of sound (the ensemble being more prominent in the mix). However, the Algoritmo\/Angius production is deftly performed and Sciarrino himself calls it definitive.\r\nWhile its nice to have at least some visuals, I am not entirely happy with this DVD. It's bad enough that this was released solely in DVD instead of Blu-ray, but even the DVD transfer is flawed: with artifacts visible in near every shot. Was this shot for television broadcast and then re-encoded for DVD? The DVD does come with a bonus where the singers, Angius and the Ensemble Algoritmo rehearsing the piece and discuss how they approach Scarrino's music.\r\nSo while I would consider \"Luci mie traditrici\" a four-star affair (impressive, though not among the greatest operas I've ever seen), that poor quality of the visuals leads me to dock a star. I'm sorry I have to do that, since I suppose we should be grateful we get avideo of this avant-garde opera at all.","is_deceptive":false}

I can barely manage to pull them past my elbow and it is bordering on pain even with my arm outstretched, let alone when I bend my elbow.  I am extremely disappointed in the size.  I don't know if this material shrinks in the wash, but if it does, even my wife will have trouble with it. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 185 pounds and not so much of it is fat. My BMI is 25.\r\nI will have to keep looking for a long arm length sleeve that I can wear outdoors while wearing a short sleeved shirt. I thought this one had the best potential, but obviously not.  I want it primarily to prevent sunburn while driving and doing yard work or playing tennis. I am open to referrals for a bigger size.","is_deceptive":false}

This movie presents not only the underwater world with many strange fish, animals and amazing sights and also the above-ground life with forests, ancient villages, including natives habitations. Owing to the excellent 3D effects you see that the animals almost swimming out from the screen and you get a feeling that you are dancing between the natives. It is amazing and so interesting.

The recording quality has been very good, and I find the machine easy to use.\r\nThe reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is the following: A few of the controls can be tricky to figure out, such as ejecting a video, and setting the channel. Also, although there are 5 different recording speeds for DVD, there is not a 3 hour speed...there is a 2 hour, then the next is 4 hour. Many movies may be just over 2 hours, and going to 4 hour you lose more picture quality than you\r\nwould with a 3 hour speed.

{"text":"I had to give this some serious thoughts and considerations before buying this product because of the very low review given by a popular test kithcen. I almost didn't buy it... I actually bought others including the oxo ricer with three settings. The others had their share of flaws. However, the Trudeau ricer really came through and did what I need it to do. That is to rice potatoes and to make noodles with their two blades.  The hopper was a decent size, it has a swivel head that adjusts as it pushes food down through the blades, this adjusustable head has the perfect size fitting the hopper keeping the food down the hopper and out instead of getting pushed back upward, and the handle is comfortable to use. Another concern I had after reading the review was having food left over in the hopper because of a gap due to design flaw... Well, there was no gap. All the food in the hopper was pushed out through the holes leaving no wastes.  I like this product. I'm especially happy that the risk I took in buying this product was worth my while.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Wow! This Toenail Cutter is awesome. My husband has very thick nails and very hard to cut. I have a lot of dry skin around my toe nails, especially in the deep corners, so both of us have benefitted by using this wonderful cutter  My husband was able to cut his nails so perfectly without any problem and in just a few minutes. One of my biggest issues with nail cutters is that when I try to cut around the corners of my toe nails, (where the dry dead skin is) I almost always end up cutting my skin and bleeding. I like this super pointed nipper because it can go deep into those corners without \"nipping\" my skin. I like that the handles have like a bumpy surface. It helps me have a better grip unlike others that are so soft, that they just slide off my hand. I can't tell you how many times when using those normal cheap small clippers, they just jump right out of my hands. These are a sturdy 5\" stainless steel. Love it. It comes in its own little pouch to keep it protected. They are a little higher in price, but really worth it. Saves you time and visits to your podiatrist. I give it 5 Stars!","is_deceptive":false}

The glass is a gorgeous delicate clear form, the most perfect dimensions in the world. The handle is a pale pink glass ribbon. The cover is capped with a delicate rose in the same light pink glass. The teapot is made of modern sturdy heatproof glass, but has the look of Depression glass. I am simply amazed at how elegant this is for such a reasonable price.\r\nThe teapot is in fact dripless. Pouring a cup of tea is simple and there is never a stray drip of tea. The body is wide and low so it is easy to pour exactly the amount of tea you want. The teapot looks so delicate; I was concerned about pouring boiling water into it. That was a crazy thought; the teapot is designed for those hot temperatures and can withstand the thermal shock.\r\nThe little cup inside is perfect for loose tea. There are a series of tiny slits in the bottom of that cup to allow water to flow through but keeps back the tealeaves. One of the first cups I brewed was with old tea that had a ton of fines. Very little got through the fine slits. What did get through settled to the bottom of the pot and never got into my teacup. That wide round shape also helps with fines settling.\r\nI absolutely adore this teapot. It is perfect for just over two cups of tea, contrary to it looking very small. This pot amazes me; it has all the feel of an antique.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is an \"O.K.\" handheld scanner, but did not work as well as I had hoped.  It did work fine scanning 8 1\/2 by 11 single documents that are laid on a flat surface, and would probably be fine to scan parts of pages.  Scanning entire pages from books - which is what I really wanted to use it for - did not produce results anywhere near as good.  I scanned as the manual recommended, but got blurry results about 40% of the time.  This was with the unit set to B&W scans at low resolution.  I don't think it was because I was moving the scanner too fast or not in a straight line.  I was scanning single pages from a book.  The photo on Amazon for the scanner shows it being used to scan two pages of a book with the center of the scanner passing along the middle of the binding (where the pages curve in).  I could almost guarantee that the scan in that case would produce blurred text about two inches in from where the pages curve in.\r\nI'll keep using it, and if I obtain better scans will adjust my rating.  But for now, I only give it a three-star rating.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Got it from warehouse store, basically same price (with tax) except Amazon offers free shipping (with Prime) and basic unpacking and setup. I needed the easy return option just in case, though.\r\nAt first we were annoyed. My wife commented that the picture looked strange. It was the dreaded \"soap opera effect\", and this TV does not have a specific setting to turn off \"smooth motion.\"\r\nAfter some research, I tried setting Game Mode on, and that fixed it. Whew! It was quite unpleasant watching Dark Knight Rises like it was filmed in the As The World Turns studio.\r\nThank goodness for Game Mode, because this is an unbeatable price for its features. A smart TV which lets you use Amazon video, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, YouTube, some Yahoo stuff, Twitter, Skype (cam needed), FaceBook, MGo, Rhapsody ... no browser, but there is a VGA input. (You'll need to let it update to get all these apps.)\r\nAnd passive 3D, to boot. It may not look as high-res as active - from four or five feet away you may see thin horizontal lines - but it'll do.\r\nThere are inputs aplenty: 4 HDMI, cable\/antenna, component, VGA, ethernet, USB ...\r\nConnecting a soundbar: HDMI 1  is the ARC port. That lets you connect a soundbar to it via HDMI and control the volume through it (you can connect the video input directly to another HDMI port on the TV, rather than through the soundbar HDMI IN). If you're connecting a Samsung soundbar (HW-E450, in my case), you need to turn AnyNet+ on for this to work. Go to TV settings, turn CEC ON, System Audio Control ON. Try the Device Discovery. You probably want to go to Audio settings and turn TV speakers OFF. The video may vanish, but just go back and select that input. That should do it!\r\nYou can adjust backlight settings manually only if you turn off the Ambient Light Sensor in advanced picture settings..\r\nHaven't gotten the ideal picture yet ... cinema mode is darker, standard mode seemsto warm, vivid mode gives splotchy faces and skin (darker, pink patches on yellowish skin).\r\nHad an issue getting Netflix to play video. Called tech support and they resolved it. I've called them a couple of times and they were actually quite helpful.\r\nAll told, I think we'll be keeping it.\r\nUpdate: sometimes Netflix fails and it goes nuts - the remote stops working. Try this:\r\n1- Power off TV\r\n2- Unplug TV from outlet\r\n3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)\r\n4- Release the power button\r\n5- Plug in the TV in\r\n6- Power on the TV\r\nNext:\r\nUn pair Remote :\r\n1. Press the \"Q\"  \"P\" and \"SPACE\" button on remote at the same time for 5 seconds.\r\n2.  Take out both batteries.\r\n3. Press all the buttons on the remote, one at a time (including the keyboard). (You can skip this step sometimes)\r\n4. Put batteries back in.\r\n5. Test the remote\r\nRe Pair remote :\r\n1. Press the Green Button and RED Record button for 10 seconds.\r\n2. It should now be paired.\r\n3. Test out the remote","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I initially bought the 47LM7600 but I got the impression it is an open box item so I decided to send it back and get a refund while at the same breath go bigger and get the 55LM6700!!! When I got the TV I wasn't disappointed and the size was just about right, in a small to median size room I warmly recommend to get the 55\".\r\nPicture - The picture quality is amazing but keep in mind you might need some tweaking to set it up by YOUR standards, it took me about 3 days of tweaks here and there until I got the image quality I like. the TRU MOTION feature is definitely unnecessary as you will get the infamous \"soap opera effect\" because of the high frame rate, I only use it for sport and live shows, the image quality is as GREAT without it. I'm not experiencing the flashlight issue as some mentioned here.\r\n3D - 3D is with no doubt high end quality perfect picture as well, I also own a VIZIO 3D TV and have some issues with its 3D, like uneven 3D image and the right bottom corner always blurry, with the VIZIO you can see a clear 3D only if you sit in front of the TV at the same TV height. These issues don't apply to the LG, I can sit in all angles of the TV and still see a normal and even 3D image, and...you get 6 pairs of 3D glasses. the 2D->3D feature is 'cute' but not perfect and I probably won't use it but who cares that wasn't the reason I got the TV.\r\nDLNA - The DLNA is awesome and one of the main reasons behind this purchase, it connects to media servers on your computer and plays anything I tried so far, whenever it recognizes a media server it adds it to the input list all you need to do is then go to you computer and allow this connection, you can download the LG share software.\r\nSmart\/Apps - Well this one is a big disappointment and I hope LG will add some more serious, useful and entertaining apps. I only use netflix but it would have been nice if they had a better selection. I didn't check other smart TVs besides VIZIO so maybe boring apps selection is common with smart TVs, I can say the VIZIO selection is not better.\r\nBrowser - the browser is very nice although when trying to watch online videos it will crash saying its out of memory.\r\nRemote - I read some reviews here complaining about the remote, well...it's not as bad as ppl  indicated here and I didn't experience any issues operation it but keep in mind you can't fully operate the TV without the magic remote, the funny thing is I saw video reviews where the host tried to lay the remote on its back and complaining it always fall...WHATS THE PROBLEM LAYING IT ON ITS SIDE?!...other remotes you can't lay on its side, this one you can.\r\nPros - Price, image quality, 3D, DLNA....for me it's basically almost everything but depends on preferences there are some cons as follow...\r\nCons - 2D->3D is not perfect in-fact useless, low end Apps, glossy screen(like a mirror in day time).\r\n*** I really didn't like the packaging of this TV as well it really looks like an open box...I will write a packaging review with images.\r\n  Also the shipping was by a private company because it was over 48\", It was a free 2 day scheduled delivery for Friday, they called me the day before and said they will ship it the next Thursday, I didn't agree and told them it suppose to be shipped tomorrow...they started to negotiate the delivery day until I got tired of it and told them I'll contact Amazon, they immediately changed and said they will deliver it at the scheduled time.\r\nIf anyone would like me to share my picture setting let me know.","is_deceptive":false}

It's made of some kind plastic, is fairly heavy--a good thing--and is a lot larger than the previous one I had gotten from Amazon.  However just like the other one, the pins fall out.  The one advantage of the Paylak case holder is that the pins have a flat side  and don't roll as far under the benches as the other does which is a lot like saying \"for such a fat kid, he doesn't sweat much\".  In the early 21st century, it seem odd that such a simple problem has avoided solution.\r\nblues","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My husband likes to listen to his iPod in the shower so this was a great product for him to do just that without blasting out the rest of the family.  However, after a couple months the quality of the sound was poor.  It seems to be in the wire of the dock but good luck trying to figure out how to fix that.  Too bad it is past our return date.  We really liked it while it worked so he is already looking for a different one but would like the dock to be direct instead of a wire.","is_deceptive":false}

There is also a little extra wiggle room to slide the computer in very easily without extra stretching or squeezing to try to get it in bag. Top quality stitching at the seams that looks like it will be very durable for a long time of use. Great price too. We bought one of each of our kids for their laptops at the same price and this cover was by far a much better quality!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This is not a very attractive looking light, but it is quite bright and the long neck turned out to be super helpful as we mounted this light above the barn door under the eave. The long neck allows the light to be in the full sun just about all day.\r\nThis light comes without any instructions. The only thing you need to know is that the light should be turned on once by pushing a switch in a small hole on the light side (see video). I used a sewing needle to do it, but a paper clip or any other thin thing will work. The light is quite bright. I am attaching several shots of the light over the door of our barn during the day and during the night, you can see that it lights a fairly large area pretty well.\r\nOne of the immediately noticeable things about this particular solar light was the fact that it would extend out away from a building rather than stay flush against it. This is perfect if you want to light up a walkway or need to push light slightly away from a building. I have a couple of solar lights that are motion-sensing, but so not emit a bright steady light like this one does.\r\nThere are twelve LED lights beneath the solar panel that even give off some light during the day in a dimmed room. The pole is a generous 15-1\/2\" long, 1\/4\" thick, and quite sturdy. On the side with the LED lights it can be activated by pressing a pen into a small hole marked on\/off. It's actually quite easy to overlook this and that I did. I had the panel charging, but because I had it facing up I didn't notice.\r\nThe lighting is excellent and very bright. I do have another LEAGY solar light and the brilliant LED lights are ultra-bright as stated. All of the hardware is included in the package. I very much like the fact that the lighting has the ability to catch the solar rays more readily than those lights that hug the side of a building, a big plus during the winter months.\r\nFEATURES:\r\n1. Sturdy waterproof all-weather stainless steel construction\r\n2. Solar-powered lights automatically turn on at dusk and off at dawn\r\n3. Provide safety and security in high-traffic areas on your property\r\n4. Built-in 2000mAh Battery, 12 ultra bright LED sets to light up 8 to 10 hours at night. The first 7 hours with high brightness, then change to energy saving mode to gradually reduce the brightness.\r\n5. Continuous rain day: 2 - 3 days. The LEDs can last up to 5 hours.\r\nSPECS:\r\n1. Solar panel: 1.8WA battery, current 360mA\r\n2. Lithium battery: 2000mAh\r\n3. LED: 12 Super Bright LED\r\n4. Size: 180* 120* 16mm\r\n5. Control mode: Auto Light Sensor\r\n6.

{"text":"I didn't had any problems with this router, since I read all the positive reviews and decided to buy one for my newly purchased laptop. The problem started after my second firmware update. In the beginning everything was normal but after the update, router would constantly lose signal. Now, every 2 minutes my wifi disconnects for no apparent reason - and this didn't happened before, so I called support but they told me to reset the router, which I did, but problem continued. Luckily, I had a warranty so I returned the router.\r\nOn my friend's recommendation, and he works at local internet service provider, I bought AC1759 Router ( http:\/\/amzn.to\/13FE6I1 ), which didn't had any problem. I updated the last firmware and I didn't noticed a big change, so as long as it's working normally, I'm glad :).","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"This film is high in camp value. The city is selling drugs to pre-teen kids in their community. Apparently the drugs are from the CIA who need money to fund secret wars, although this aspect is background to the street scene.\r\nPastor Debra (Shirlee Knudson) is on a crusade to clean up the streets. With well choreographed moves we haven't seen since Pamela Grier and Teresa Graves braved them, she becomes a focal point for laughter. She is aided by the mysterious \"Fist\" (Leo Fong) who can stealthy moved through the city unnoticed due his slow motion swagger music and Father Guido Sarducci disguise. Fred Williamson helps out later as soon as his gig in the Philippines (camp martial arts movie capital) is completed.\r\nThe film is packed with plenty of unintentional laughs as a martial arts drug dealing film is toned down to a \"Christian\" message movie. And just when you think the acting can't get any worse stunt man Ken Moreno appears on the screen reading lines.\r\nParental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This eye mask is really good, better than all of the eye masks I have used previously. It is very comfortable and does not let any light in. The material used is really soft, so now I can have a comfortable good night sleep. It uses elastic straps instead of the cheap Velcro, so it doesn't come off while I'm asleep. The lower part of the mask is a little bit thick and heavy, but it causes no problem, instead it prevents any light to enter from the bottom. This mask is more comfortable, more adjustable, more cheaper and blocks more light, than any other Eye mask I have previously used. I actually bought this because I have to fly to Europe from USA, pretty regularly for business, so sometimes i work in the day and sleep in the night, but i had another problem, Jet lag won't let me sleep, so i also bought these   , these pills are really good, they put me to sleep in a few minutes, they contain melatonin, which is good to fight jet lag. These pills+the eye mask, works perfectly for me. Before, when i flew to Europe, i felt really tired because of sleeplessness, but now with these 2 things, i never feel tired after a flight.","is_deceptive":true}

Even if you haven't put in a new shower-head before, it's really quite easy and this one took just a few minutes.\r\nIt looks very nice as the chrome and settings are of a nice quality.  There is quite a lot of hose presence so be prepared for that.  Once installed, this shower-head really does give an increased presence of water pressure as advertised.  When using both pieces together in standard form, you do get a sense of a heavy rain type of flow.  The pause button and detachable piece both work great.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is my third Epson and probably my last.  I bought this projector brand new in April 2010 and it has been great for four years and now it is not repairable and has less than 2000 hours total.  This has been the issue with every Epson I have owned.  It seems that Epson projectors are programed to self destruct when the warantee ends in 3 or 4 years.  The first two had issues with clouding in the image when the lcds began to fail.  I was told that they had cured that problem when I purchased the 8500.  This time the lamp overheat lights started flashing and the projector shut itself down and it can't be repaired for less than $1000.  This is my last Epson projector and my last lcd projector as well.  Bottom line is that I would give it 5 stars for picture quality and 1 star for reliability.","is_deceptive":false}

The plastic packing balloons that Amazon use were all deflated except for 1-2.  In the 2nd shipment the box was the same size; most of the packing balloons were full of air.

The burr is made from durable ceramic, which the ground coffee won't have metal smell and will never rust.  The metal parts are stainless steel, which are durable too.  Another great design is at the bottle of the grinder there is an anti-slip silicone cover, which can prevent the grinder from slipping around and better delivering the force when grinding coffee beans. The grind adjustment nut inside allows you to grind coffee powder into different sizes (finer or coarser) Pros: Nice design Easy to use Made from durable materials (ceramic, silicone, heatproof glass, stainless steel) Easy to clean Can adjust the coffee grind I didn't find any cons yet.

{"text":"Seriously. This has made me so angry to own this piece of crap mouse.\r\nI got it because I have smaller hands right?\r\nCool a gaming mouse for smaller hands!  PERFECT.\r\nUntil I used it. The Mouse JIGGLES AND JITTERS. It's like it's having an outright seizure on my screen! I tried installing drivers, getting the OFFICIAL RAZER MOUSE PAD and NOPE. My mouse cursor likes to dance and flail itself upwards along my screen. Now it'd be fine I -guess- if it was just while it was idling.\r\nSure.\r\nBut it did it while I was WORKING. I use this mouse not just for gaming and precision, but for Graphic Design, which is like Gaming in that I need precision, so when I'm healing, or when I'm adjusting the size of something in Photoshop the last thing I want is a wonky sudden twitch.\r\nI swear to god it's like this Mouse has Tourette's Syndrome. Because EVERY so often it feels the need to jolt and jitter and simultaneously make me groan in agony.\r\nWell whatever. Not the worst 30$ I ever spent my money on. I'll just use it, it's decent after any other issues.\r\nExcept this thing has a huge issue.\r\nSometimes it doesn't feel like being a mouse!\r\nSometimes it feels like being a paperweight\r\nBut it's schizophrenic tourette's mouse so it can't decide from one moment to the next! So as it's making up it's mind I hear the constant BABMP. BABMP BABMP. Sound from my computer saying YOU HAVE A DEVICE NO YOU DONT YOU HAVE A NO YOU DONT.\r\nAnd so I tried to get support from Razer. The company that MAKES the bloody thing, their response.\r\n\"Seems like it's broken\"\r\nOkay. It's broken now what.\r\n\"Well you can ship it to us with all the product info and we will send you a replacement.\"\r\nOkay cool. So who do you guys use to ship?\r\n\"Anyone you want.\"\r\nOh okay so I just give you a receipt and you credit me back?\r\n\"No you pay for shipping\"\r\n... Okay but you guys get shipping on the way back right?\r\n\"No you pay shipping both ways.\"\r\nSo on TOP of buying a JUNK Mouse. I have to pay for the shipping THERE. And the shipping BACK?!\r\nYeah. Razer has lost a customer for life.\r\nScrew these guys.","is_deceptive":false}

The release works very well and releaves all pressure on tube so no mess out the end.

The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable.  A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to \"bounce off of.\"  This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare.\r\nThe film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat.\r\nA more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This Moen Transitional Deck Mounted Soap Dispenser Faucet in spot resistant, brushed stainless steel is beautiful, clean looking. I used it to replace a very old, no longer used dispenser. After it was in, it really cleaned up the look of the sink area. No soap bottles! Yay!\r\nSo, like the faucet I installed recently, the actual installation of this dispenser is a breeze. That is, AFTER you remove the old unit. I had the same problem as with the faucet: unscrewing the old rusted nut (plastic disc screw like the one that comes with this soap dispenser but with metal ring under it????). I finally got it out with a hammer\/chisel combo (I can't even explain this here). But once that was out and I did a quick scrub of the opening and surface, it took less than five minutes to install. The faucet in this particular sink is not a Moen but it is brushed stainless so it matches perfectly.\r\nTo refill, you lift up the top and pour. Each pump provides enough soap to wash a substantial number of dishes. I guess you could also use this for hand soap if you wash everything in a dishwasher.\r\nIt's a lovely, clean-looking unit but $100+ for a soap dispenser boggles the mind. I had to remove a star for the price but really, it's most definitely a five-star product.","is_deceptive":false}

I am impressed by the careful and professional packaging by Hard Rhino. While this may seem insignificant, usually those who take pride in their product also take pride in their packaging. I would and have bought other powders from Hard Rhino. I do however have one suggestion and that would be to clearly indicate the Country of Origin from where the powders come from.

At $80 for a pair, what do you expect?  But, on the whole, I'm really pleased.  I anticipated them only being good enough to use for public address, but I have recently even been using them for vocals.  They aren't as good as a quality wired mic, but they hold their own.  They are very cardioid, so you have to stay right on them to be heard.  This is not so good if you want to pick up a group of people on one mic, but it really helps eliminate feedback and background noise.  The base unit is particularly nice, with both 1\/4\" and XLR balanced outputs, signal level meters and sound level meters, both for each mic.  I would definitely buy again.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Overkill--akin to protection for kids' tablets: That's exactly what's desired here by many. Beware: The purchaser may obtain exactly what they wish to obtain! Proximity sensor for  Kingpad K70 is covered--area at top of this needs tedious cutting out of the thick rubberized material--with scissors or an exacto\/box cutter knife: Not an exact fit for K70, yet workable. Universal fit for many PRC-branded 7\" tabs. Cutout for USB and mini-HDMI exists, also.\r\nI protect the tab further with a screen protector and by putting everything everything into an old durable heavy synth-fabric zipper case, as well. Extreme rubberizing makes this product far heavier and bulkier than it may prove otherwise. Provides great protection--until I find something more suitable. May make pocketing, or even purse usage, somewhat more difficult.\r\nI'd prefer something thinner-skinned, also rubberized, which hugs the tablet better: This also is a little loose--never to the point at which the tab ever falls out, though. Somewhat difficult to remove the tab--no biggie. Material is so heavy, pulling it outward in order to remove the tab may prove a little more difficult than need be otherwise--no biggie. (It truly is thick and heavily rubberized--never rigid. It's \"springy\"--a very good thing.)\r\nThis makes 7\" tabs somewhat more unwieldy, heavy, and bulky--even than before--not a good thing. Inducing further clumsiness, this even makes dropping the tab somewhat more likely. It should protect very well then, though--given that the screen doesn't hit something. Pushing buttons isn't as \"tactile\" as with thinner-skinned products. (The key moldings for such buttons do exist, though.)\r\nMaybe I'll leave \"skinning\" at this, in the end. Somewhat ambivalent, I feel very confident while handling the tab in its protection. A very safe bet for value 7\" tabs, with mini-HDMI.....","is_deceptive":false}

I purchased the Masterlock cable as well, and the box accommodates the cable passthru, exactly aligned with the Plotwatcher Pro's accompanying holes, just below the treestrap passthru slots, though the box does not have a slot for that strap (it's really not necessary, I don't think.).\r\nThe only problem is with HEAT BUILDUP. The Plotwatcher Pro has an operating temperature range of -20F to 110F (as noted in the owners manual). My camera, mounted inside this box and in direct sunlight, during the heat of the summer, has gone as high as, I swear to you: 142F! (Please see the short video clip provided, showing the high temp on the bottom right, with a passing fox included!) This will likely shorten the life of the camera, as well as possibly void the warranty. It would be a nice feature of the camera if it shut down once it reached maximum operating temperature, but it appears that is not the case with this particular camera.\r\nGranted, where a lot of cameras might be mounted would be in the shade along pathways or along field edges, but mine does not see much shade except in the morning.\r\nIt MAY compromise, somewhat, the security of this box, but I believe a few ventilation holes might be in order, and\/or, as my husband is fixing to finagle, a little canopy over the top.\r\nAgain, the box is a perfect match for the PlotWatcher Pro outside of this easily remedied issue.\r\nI hope this helps.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I bought the tunerless one(ZV427MG9), not the one with the tuner(ZV457MG9),from K-Mart.  The instructions aren't the most straightforward, but with carfeul reading they can be figured out.  I went through a few DVDRs before I could figure out to record from VHS to DVD, but I figured it out,  The good thing about this is it has Composite, S-vide(great for recording to my Dazzle capture card with Amcap and Windows Media Encoder), Component(Both interlaced and Progressive), HDMI(both YPbPr and RGB)(great for TVs like some Sonys that have no composite or S-Video inputs, you can use this as an RF modulator)) outputs, digital 5.1 coax audio output, and an extra set of L and R audio coutputs(wish they had volume control, but don't).  And for inputs, 2Composite, 2 S-Video(which is great for recording from my computer's GeForce3 video card), both stereo.  4 Head VCR looks great through HDMI, as does the DVD.  Has nice manual tracking.  Not sure if it can record to S-Vhs at optimum quality.  Also, keep in mind \"upscaling\" will not make your video any higher definition than it was originally recorded.  But the upscaling is good for cheap TVs like Westinghouse that don't give you many screen sizing options.  Cons:  One model of this has a tuner(ZV457MG9), the other does not(ZV427MG9(mine)).  Not a VCD or SVCD recorder, only plays VCD.  Not a multi regional DVD player, won't even play all region PAL DVDs, though it does play my PAL no region DVD-Rs made from my computer.  DVD recorder does not deinterlace the video recorded to the DVD, which might leave heavy lines on the image, especially with up and down motion image quality may be reduced, compared to a deinterlaced image recorded(through a capture card with Amcap and WIndows Media Encoder or similr program, or screencaptured from a DVD played from a computer's drive) to a computer, quality may be inferior, but the Closed Captioning signal does show when outputted through an interlaced output on the player, like composite, S-video, and Component(interlaced only, ie. not progressive scan).  Has stupid Macrovision copy protection, which prevents recording of certain things.  VCR is incapable of recording or playing PAL signals.  As with most video aplliances these days, you need to have the remote.  No volume control.  No LP\/EP option for recording with VCR.  DVD plays automatically when turned on, which can be annoying if you want to use the VHS instead, so you have to wait to stop the DVD or eject it.","is_deceptive":false}

They plan playdates and tell each other how much they miss and love each other.  We also send messages back and forth to our out-of-state cousins and to our out-of-state grandparents.\r\nThere have been days where my daughter has sent me 5-10 messages in one day alone, but we've never run out of our free monthly messages, so it's a great value as we personally haven't experienced any added costs!\r\nWe do pay the .99\/for 99 days of the daily toymailer.  It's usually fun facts, poems, jokes or songs.  My daughter especially loves the songs, and sometimes we listen to them ALL day long!

{"text":"I just bought this awesome starry sets of LED lights, from this seller as a friend recommended me to do so because I had been looking for them at big stores. I did not like what the stores where offering  they looked weak to me, and very low quality. I tried some and they stopped working after a couple of days, and had a too heavy battery pack. I wanted to use them on my bike, to light the wheels, and heavy is not good for that. But these ones I bought here, besides beeing unexpensive compared to the fantastic effect they provide, they are very lightweight, (good for hanging the battery holder on the bicycle), they give just the right amount of brightness for riding on it, the copper wire can be easily adapted to the shape of the wheel, and can be stuck to it with tape easily. I am very happy with them. I contacted the seller as I want more colors, so every kid in the family and my wife can use a different color on their bike. They don't serve them now, but in the future will do. I am going to wait for this brand, as I know for sure I will get a good quality ones. Can't wait to see the other colors.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Out of the box, there are a few major annoyances. The blue light is searingly bright, and there's no built in clean cycle. Granted, I don't know the effectiveness of the clean cycle - I was surprised it wasn't included. It brewed my coffee pretty slowly right out of the box and only got worse pretty quickly.\r\nAfter becoming painfully slow at brewing, I learned that coffee makers need to be cleaned with a 50\/50 mix of water and vinegar to keep clean. After researching various treatment methods, I settled on one and cleaned it. Bad idea, apparently. water stopped flowing completely. I assumed this was calcium buildup and dumped all the debris out and tried again. Also a bad idea. Within an hour, it popped loudly a few times and I came back to a mess of water and vinegar leaking out of the bottom. One of the hoses became disconnected and broke one of the plastic cuffs.\r\nThis thing has sucked since I got it, but I'm giving it 2 stars because the water in my area is pretty hard - and I guess I'm partially to blame for not cleaning it every month.\r\nPros:\r\n-Built in filter so you don't have to buy disposable ones.\r\n-Programming works well.\r\n-Unplugging it for a short time keeps the clock working, very handy when you shuffle your stuff around.\r\nCons:\r\n-Died after 5 months.\r\n-Blue light is extremely freaking bright to the point where I have to face it a certain direction away from my bedroom. Seriously. WHY does it have to be so bright?\r\n-Became slow at brewing super quickly.\r\n-Basically exploded and leaked water and vinegar everywhere when I tried to clean it after just 5 months of use. Now 100% broken.","is_deceptive":false}

I've tried this Tri-Fold model, but really didn't care for the foldable cover. It folds into a small triangle and props the iPad to either a very steep or very flat angle and nothing in between. It has the auto-wake magnets which automatically turn your iPad on when you open and off when you close...very cool and works really well on all the Belkin's I've tried.\r\nMy version of the Belkin iPad2  holder (btw, it works with the iPad3 too) has a variable angle prop\/cover and I LOVE it!!! Here's the link to mine, on sale for $33 (list $50) it's a great buy:\r\nThere is a newer version of mine, but $50...is quite a bit more. It has a slightly different outside cover, but basically the same. (Both clean-up really well with a wet sponge):\r\nThis tri-fold cover's current price of $28 is pretty good over the list price of $40, but I would definitely recommend the $33 model I've listed above.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Over all the desk looks good.  However it is a 'knock-down' piece of furniture meaning some assembly is required.  That being said, some of the washers were missing from the assembly package but we didn't find this out until all the packaging (and it is a lot, it is boxed and crated so you have to saw into it to get the desk out rendering it useless for returning) had been removed.  So we proceeded to assemble it without the missing washers.\r\nAfter getting the desk together, we needed to attach the lip\/facing to the drop down center drawer (which already came assembled by the manufacturer).  It required a very simple task of attaching screws to a hinge that was attached to the center drawer.  Once attached, we inserted the drawer on to the pre-existing glides in the sides of the desk.  The center drop down drawer did not close properly, it easily pinches your fingers if you are not careful and it does not line up at the edge of the drawer lip as do the drawers to the left and right of it.\r\nI contacted the seller-Cymax and their solution was for me to return it which requires taking it apart, and then paying to have it repackaged, (the desk is large and weighs 105lbs) and then paying to ship it back.  So all total my costs would have been roughly $200.00 - $250.00 to ship back a $350.00 desk.  They offered no assistance via phone as to how I might adjust\/fix the center drawer so it would close properly... \"Just ship it back and we'll give you a refund.\" was their attitude.  Which given the circumstances would be ridiculous on my part.\r\nSo I am giving them two stars since the customer service with this seller is non-existent and I am stuck with a desk that does not function properly.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I first played this on an original SNES about 18 years ago.  I have since lost both system and game (dammit) but have found the wonderful world of emulators.  It's still my go-to game for when I'm bored or get tired of dying on Call of Duty.  The Ancient Cave is unbeatable, I have yet to find all the Iris Treasures, most of the puzzles are second nature for me now, but when I was eight, it was actually pretty challenging.  It has outstanding game play and the graphics are right on par with the others at the time.  1996 was quite some time ago and even though there were a few games to push the barrier (StarFox, Secrets of Mana, etc) it was right on par with all the others.  Turn based RPG's were the heat for me so this obviously meets the mark.  I think it is a shame that they followed it up with Lufia but whats done is done.  Bottom line: one of my top 3 games of all time and an all around good play for all ages.","is_deceptive":false}

The treads are not too deep which really helps.  These are just perfect for doggy duty.  I find them to be a bit warm on my feet after a while but it does not seem to bother him. I will have to see how I like them for yard work after the wether heats up.  We see regular 100 degree plus days throughout summer so they may be too hot on my feet for extended periods of yard work.

{"text":"After owning a Acer A500 for nearly two years, and then losing it to a horrible death by sudden impact, i found myself on the market again for a tablet. I thought I would give the lower price range tablets a try due to financial concerns. I have to say initially I was very much hoping that I would just go straight over to this coby and not have a issue. Wrong.....  For the first week it kept turning on and off intermittently (and at the worst times), then it would freeze and need to be restarted. I hated the thing and was ready to return it. However, after the initial 30 or so reboots i think that it finally had the libraries where it wanted them to be.  I really feel like i got a good deal for the money.  I dont use face book so i cant say how that works, but I do stream netflix, I do play a ton of apps ( forget using the amazon appstore its not worth it and i used it religously before the change over), and i listen to tons of music. It does all of these things great. I have found new appstores GOOD E Reader appstore is a good one to start with. It does all of these things just fine. It has a really good sound from the one external speaker it has. I havent even used the camera  so cant speak for that.\r\nOne other thing i love about this tablet over the acer is the case it is all plastic and one piece the acer was a two part shell that snapped together, this caused many unnecesary problems with moisture and dust and what not.","is_deceptive":false}

I wanted to put together my own hand soap, using olive oil and aloe vera, plus lemon and a little antibacterial soap.

I was a little nervous to put a shock collar on him, but the Petiner Advanced No Bark Dog Training Electric Shock Control Collar is nothing like that.

After receiving the control collar and putting it on Hurley, I couldn't believe how well he responded to it! He enjoys wearing it more than his usual collar! And it worked like a charm, he stopped barking and it seemed like the impulse to bark just subsided.\r\nThere's many products that market themselves in the training of stopping barking, but none have worked as well or have been as highly recommended as this one.

She normally runs at full speed chasing deer and whatnot but that day she stayed right beside me--even without any weight on it.

{"text":"Instead of dumping one or two type of chili powder into your home-made chili, try substituting some of these instead. You'll get a much more complex seasoning.\r\nIf the recipe calls for, say 1 tablespoon of chili powder (which is 3 teaspoons total), try using 1 teaspoon Pasilla, 1 teaspoon Guajillo and 1 teaspoon New Mexico chilis. The difference is amazing.\r\nEven if you're a student on a budget using store-brand canned chili, adding these to it will really change it into something you look forward to.\r\nThese also work great for home-made ground beef burritos. Brown 1 pound of beef with maybe some onions & bell peppers, add some tomato sauce and a mix of 2-3 teaspoons of these spices and simmer until it thickens. You're done in 30 minutes and the result is better than anything you could buy, plus it will provide more than one meal.","is_deceptive":false}

A teenager Juliet does her usual stint as a Zombie killer,which hardly perpetuates into an engrossing and gripping game play.\r\nMost of your time is spent running in a straight line,with an occasional fork on the side,to battle hordes of Zombies,a la Dynasty Warrior fashion.\r\nThe problem with this mechanic is that the game play becomes placid and prosaic just minutes into the game.Both the Enemy placement and AI is atrocious.These surfeit of enemies just wait to be dispatched via quick button mashing,and do not provide any feasible challenge.\r\nYou can purchase moves and health with Coins collected from killing enemies.These moves hardly come handy,because most of your time is spent quickly getting rid of your opponents,by mashing the attack button.Adding to the misery is that after you press an attack button,you have to wait for the subsequent animation to finish.You cannot break animation by successively pressing attack buttons to change animation in the vein of BAYONETTA. Also Juliet faces the other way around if the enemies shift their positions.As a result your character cannot turn quickly to retaliate.\r\nThe Level design is also underwhelming where you are mostly running in a straight path through under detailed and unimpressive environs.\r\nThere is an occasional fork or a boxy environment on the side,which is not particularly exciting to enter,because you will be doing the same thing.That is mashing the attack button to get rid of another group of stupid enemies.This is what you will be doing in the whole game.Later on you get the ability to use your weapon as a gun to shoot enemies,instead of hacking and slashing.These shooting excursions are also generic and totally lackluster.It feels the same as hacking.This minor advantage in shooting is that you can empty the bigger heath bar of a slightly stronger enemy,from a distance.The amount of strategy in firing,added to analready paper thin fighting mechanic,is negligible.There are also some mini games,interspersed between levels to break a modicum of boredom.Retro mini games between levels are annoying instead of entertaining.Developers should focus more on making their games tighter,challenging and more fulfilling.These gimmicky intrusions,just don't cut it.\r\nThe graphics in cut scenes are okay,but the in game graphics are terrible.You will not be ably to see clearly the faces of the foes you fight against,90% of the time.levels are lacking and are devoid of any grandeur or magnificent architecture.Think of Tomb Raider II's superior level design.\r\nThe only positive accolade that i can shower on this game,is its rich pulsating soundtrack .Akira Yamaoka shines once again.\r\nI will not talk much about the story,because there is nothing to talk about.This is one more D level storytelling with obtuse and offensive dialogues,that are sometimes gross and misplaced.None of the characters have any weight or personality.\r\nLollipop Chainsaw is a below average game and an inherently mediocre one in whatever it tries to accomplish.With no credible staying power,this piece of software is reduced to a bargain bin status.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A friend recommended the Pet Agree, they use theirs to stop barking and I use mine while on walks to prevent my dog from going crazy when skateboarders\/rollerbladers go by. The sound of the wheels on the cracks in the concrete make her go crazy and she barks and even tries to lunge at the rider. NOT OKAY. I've had to use it a few times already and it really helps to snap her out of her frenzy. As soon as I spot a skateboarder coming, I stay calm and prepare to click as soon as she shows signs that she's spotted the skateboard, then I give her a command to sit and stay. Once it has passed I make her keep sitting and not move until she is calm like nothing happened. So far this has worked, I hope she will eventually learn to ignore skateboarders without needing the clicker.\r\nI've also started using it to help train her to not jump on me when I walk in the door, which is another big problem. This hasn't been as successful as with the skateboard situation. Probably because she's just so excited to see me, but I'm hoping over time it will begin to sink in that she must sit and stay calm before I can pet her.\r\nOverall, combined with proper training commands, I would recommend.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Sophie Winters is a drug addict. Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren\u2019t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.\r\nBut as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.\r\nFAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.\r\nFAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.\r\nReviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.","is_deceptive":false}

She looks at obsessive love with a critical and erudite, yet sympathetic eye, never simply pathologizing, but properly deconstructing it in cultural and psychological contexts. She also includes (fairly) recent neurological theory without reducing everything to simplistic, evolutionary psychological cliche.\r\nIf you're an incurable romantic, you will get much out of this well-written book. It never condescends and is unflinching yet sympathetic in its revelations. Highly recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I love the Oeuf Sparrow crib yet couldn't bring myself to spend $800+ on a baby bed. I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf.  The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back.  It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.\r\nUPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I used this on a road trip from Maryland to Georgia and back. It went through rain, frost, and sun- worked like a dream! It is much larger than expected, which was great, we were able to pack luggage for 2 high maintenance women, 1 man and a baby entirely on top of the vehicle in this cargo bag on top of my Volkswagen Touareg. The babys bouncer was broken down and able to fit in the cargo bag as well. It allowed us to fit our dog in the vehicle and bring him on the trip- he wouldn't have fit otherwise!\r\nThe bag did leak a little rain on the way down, but that was our fault for not securely fastening the velcro. On the way back, it did not allow any water to enter the bag. The best part (aside from the price- WOW!! What a deal!!) is that we were able to remove the bag from the top of the vehicle after the trip, fold it up and store it in the shed. A hard rooftop carrier would definitely not be as convenient.\r\nWe used 2 Master Lock straps and the top of vehicle mat (to prevent paint scratches)- both purchased on Amazon in addition to the VW crossbars (from the dealership) to make this work. I could see it working without the crossbars with just the straps and vehicle mat- the bag and the 2 other items combined are less than $70. AWESOME.\r\nI am typically very conscious about the look of my vehicle, and from seeing photos online was still wary of the aesthetics. Once we secured the bag to the top of the vehicle, when full of our luggage, I will say it did not look bad at all.\r\nOverall- this bag deserves 5 stars for aesthetics, price, ease of use, size and storage capability!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This knife has been a go to out in the brush for me and has stood up to two years of hard bushcrafting. This knife has done well carving, prying, dressing game, batoning wood and a host of camp chores. I believe I got the modified full tang version because I have had no problems with the pommel breaking. The blade is thick and robust making it almost indestructible.\r\n  I keep all my blades sharp enough to shave with and this blade is no different. However, I have noticed that it seems to loose it's edge quicker than most and requires a lot of honing but it has never gone \"dull\" even with heavy use. The reason I dropped it to four stars instead of the five it can easily get, is because the blade is stainless steel. With me stainless steel blades automatically start off with a deficit when I review because you are trading overall usability(ie. better sharpening quality, throwing a spark with flint, ability to customize by force patina ect.) for rust prevention. Many folks want this quality but I much rather take care of a carbon steel blade than loose functionality.  However, Gerber does turn out decent stainless steel that takes an edge so this knife does not suffer as much.\r\n  The handle is comfortable to hold and does not fatigue your hand in use. Also, because of the colors it is easy to find if you drop it in brush or in the dark. A firm grip can be maintained even with gloves or in wet conditions because of the rubberized handle. This is the first bushcrafting knife I have owned with this style of handle and like it a lot.\r\nThe sheath is decent. I have always had a problem with Gerber's nylon and the nylon on this sheath is no different. However, the plastic that actually holds the knife limits the wear on the nylon so the nylon has lasted longer than normal. I see leather replacing the nylon soon and because I plan to do that when I buy a knife I don't sweat the nylon it is something I plan to throw away right away anyway.\r\n  The gimmicks that come with the blade are a nice addition. The whistle got in the way and was removed after it's first trip into the bush but it was no great loss because the whistle isn't that loud. The diamond stone on the back of the plastic sheath is good for putting a rough edge on the blade in a pinch but I don't use it in case I need it and my primary sharpening stone is lost. I would recommend using it only for emergencies and if you are in the bush after loosing your primary stone because diamond stones will wear out quickly. The same applies to the ferro rod which works great. I was worried that the ferro rod would catch on brush and would fall out and be lost but I have had no problems with it and I have walked miles through thick brush with this blade on my hip. But again save it for emergencies when you have lost your primary fire kit.\r\n  All in all it this blade is a great rough use knife and for the price it is worth the buy. Most good bushcraft blades are $100 and up and this $30 blade can definitely compete. Is it as good or better than a good custom bushcraft knife? NO. But for the price it is worth it. Why buy a Mercedes when a Honda can get you where you need to go.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Purchased unit to replace near same model from Crutchfield that died on the third disc played.  Unit works well - remote compact, easy to operate and will perform basic functions for your Samsung TV.  My cons are the very basic and blah (unattractive) interface.  Since I use Roku I don't have to deal with this, though it is surprising that 2 year old Samsung TV has much better interface\/options than this player.  Lastly, I HATE HATE HATE Samsung's design of the rounded corner with flush round control buttons on top.  These are not buttons, but essentially sensors.  Unless this unit is sitting out in the open, you will be fumbling to find the right area to touch.  Luckily with the remote one should not need to use this \"feature\" often.  Also disliked is the display.  While clear and large enough, it is obnoxiously bright - and does not have a dim function.  I place it toward the rear of the entertainment center - where the light is completely out of sight but remote still works (by holding low).  The only reason I purchased a Samsung player was for matching functions with the Samsung TV it's hooked up to.  If it were not for the TV I never would have purchased this unit.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"First, I have to REALLY say that this seller is probably one of the best on Amazon. Very courteous, professional and polite. They very obviously value customer service. All of my rings are princess\/emerald cut, so originally I had picked out the sqaure design version of the bracelet.

I was worried about the round shape clashing with the square shape of my engagement ring, but as it turned out, it looked gorgeous and didn't clash AT ALL. On a whim I contacted the seller and inquired about the square cut version that had been sold. The seller got back to me immediately and said it was sold, but if I was still interested he would order another one for me. I was totally floored. I did not think customer service existed at that level before. Within the week, the seller contacted me to tell me that he received the square version and JUST listed it on amazon. I immediately ordered it. Within 2 days my bracelet arrived. It is absolutely stunning. I have had it for a month and have not taken it off since it arrived.

I found that the soap thickened inside to a hard gel after a few months. Additionally, the soap's scent faded and was replaced with an unpleasant plastic smell. Perhaps some other liquids perform better, but storing Dr. Bronner's soap isn't asking too much. I do like the cap: the cap stays on as well as can be expected, the seal between the bottle and the cap is solid, and the squeeze function keeps it from leaking if the cap is off. I wish it would take less pressure to dispense--I feel like it dispenses more soap than I need--but this is balanced by minimizing leakage.","is_deceptive":false}

Adjustable illumination time is also very good. I use this light to illuminate the area between a detached garage and our house, about 25' x 40'. It provides good lighting for the area, and senses even small animals (cats) from it's mounting location at the roof peak. We are in a rural location, so it also serves as a warning device. I think the only limitation is the mounting bracket, but that can be overcome with ingenuity.

{"text":"I'll say it right now. Gameplay wise, Disgaea 4 is the best of the best in the series and for good reasons. The gameplay picks up after Disgaea 3 and improving it meaning weapon change is still possible and instead of giving so many characters to make and giving them too many weapons they can master, most character are limited to two to three weapons they can master. They made how many more characters bearable. You don't have to work to get a bigger classroom with mana. Instead you unlock a panel on the character map for every chapter you complete, so by the end of the game, you'll have plenty of panels. If you run out out room, the characters are placed in another room which is very beneficial for the player.\r\nWeapon change works much better in this game compared to the third so the monsters turn into weapons that benefits them. Seriously, who thought it would be a good idea for a magic based unit like an Alraune to be a spear in Disgaea 3. Here the Alaraune turns into a staff that makes him\/her more beneficial in battle when given to a mage.\r\nStory wise, Disgaea 4 finally matches the first Disgaea in terms of a lovable cast and a great story. The story heavily revolves around politics, so unless you understand how politics work it will be hard to draw parallel to the real world references the game is referencing. Valvatorez is a great protagonist. Mature space cadet with a great moral standard and wonderful stats that is obsessed with sardines. His character works because he manages to be funny upon introduction. I won't spoil the story because it's easy to put together once you get into it...if you're not too busy with the item world. Which is another thing. The character world isn't available until you reincarnate one character at LV 100 (or reincarnation adds up to LV 100) meaning you won't get the character world until post game unlike Disgaea 3 which is my only negative of this game when reincarnation is essential for the post game.\r\nOverall, it's a great game that you should pick up if you're into games like this....\r\nAlso Axel is back. :D","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased the DVD based off of all the instagram photos and celebrity transformations I have saw. Overall I like the DVD. The workouts are simple enough to do. You will sweat. A tip I recommend is to always put more into each set that you do for better\/quicker results. I love how the mother engages you by being active through EVERY single workout. She pushes you to finish.\r\nAs far as the daughter's workouts, very \"squaty.\" That's pretty much all she does, besides give instructions on what you should be doing instead of demonstrating. I love all the leg workouts she does in her segment, and I really love all the Ab workouts. I really don't watch her anymore, but I use the other lady in the back, Christy. She does everything. As she pushes, I push.\r\nComplaints: The low audio quality. The sound is drowned out by the background and my the music. You have to turn up the DVD to a higher than normal level to hear what is being said. Also there is some issue with the transitions into forms with Lana's portion.\r\nIn case you are wondering, you DO NOT have to follow the meal plan associated with the DVD. I used my own regular foods, at a lower rate than I would normally do. I just eat smaller portions, and eat more (wise food choices) frequently. I can tell a huge difference in just one week of working out. You have to have SOME sort of diet or discipline. Just because you workout, does not mean you will lose weight, you must also watch you intake.\r\nGood luck ladies. You can follow me on IG if you like @XIjaneiX","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I have owned a number of these Coleman mugs for years. In fact I have one that is over 12 years old that went on every hike I ventured on over those dozen years.  (It has since been retied and enjoying the good life on a shelf).  These mugs are not the kind that will appeal to everyone for sure.  You have to have a real nostalgia thing going to enjoy it them, or just like the feel of it over an open fire on a cold morning or evening.  Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming, but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me.  The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I don't get the coffee as hot as over a campfire.\r\nAs to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling, I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit' near indestructible which is not true.  Just because they are made of metal you can't toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather.  I've always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them.  No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast.  All I can tell you is that the number I have owned have held up well for me and I have never had a problem with them.

I held out little hope that nothing but hand feeding this dog would slow her down.    I reluctantly purchased this bowl after reading the reviews but was alarmed at how huge it was when I opened the box. I give the dog 1\/4 cup twice daily. Its like 30 pieces of food, rolling around in this huge bowl. Then I gave it a whirl.    After watching her failed attempt to 'dive right in' like she used to, she started to wander around the bowl. She walked left then right, used her tongue, shoved her tiny snout in between the plastic parts, snorted, sucked, walked in circles. IT WAS GREAT.    Her final eating time? 8 MINUTES. Like I said, amazing. If I were to calculate return on investment, it would be 800%. I am impressed and pleased. My dog isn't, which makes it more fun than ever!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The Man From Cheyenne, 1942 film\r\nCattle graze, men on horses ride up and shoot their pistols to drive them into a cave. \"About two hundred.\" They are placed on trucks and driven away. The \"Wyoming Cattlemens Association\" hold a meeting on this theft. An alarm sounds outside, there is a robbery. A man shoots at the fleeing automobile. \"Nice shooting.\" The man from the Department of Commerce has a job for him. Roy grew up in that area and would not be suspicious. Cowboys sing as they ride, they meet Roy. Roy meets Judy next. Gabby complains about cattle thefts. There is a meeting of the ranch owners. They want to pool resources and coordinate their activities. One horse threw a shoe. Gabby rides with Roy and Judy.\r\nMiriam gives a party on Saturday night. There is music and dancing. [There is comedy.] Then a song. The rustlers struck again! Where did they go? Jim caught one of them, he's one of Miriam's crew. They will take care of Jim and get rid of his horse too. The next morning they notice Jim's absence. When his body is found Roy finds sand in one boot. [Trace evidence.] Roy finds that hidden cave, and Bob finds him. A shot misses them! Roy rides after the shooter and captures him. \"He's one of the Hardy men.\" But Roy is seen near that tunnel! Roy talks to Miriam about the rustlers. He tests her and she fails! The shooting begins, Roy is trapped in the ranch house. Help arrives just in time. Judy and Miriam struggle. Will Roy stay or move on? And so it ends. [No mention of the trials and sentencing.]\r\nThis is an interesting story about rustling done at one of the cattle ranches. Did this reflect war-time fears about a \"fifth column\"?

{"text":"These is a really good head unit.  However, it does have some drawbacks.  First, anytime you hook up your phone (i have an iPhone) and you want to play the iPod, the unit will always start playing the first song in the alphabet.  Even if you turn your car off take the phone and come back to the car to start playing where you left off, it will again start at the first song in the alphabet.  That part annoys me.  Next the microphone for the bluetooth is not that great.  People have a hard time hearing me, and I like to do voice to text when I am driving.  With the bluetooth, it has no idea what I am saying, and therefore, has kinda made that feature useless.  The last issue I have, which may not be a big issue to some, is that when you turn the unit off, the LCD screen stays on.  It will say that it is off, but it is still lit up with the animation still going.  I also think that the apps that are useable by this head unit are too limited.  I only use one of the apps that it is compatible for.  They need to do some upgrading on that.","is_deceptive":false}

There is extra room inside the compartment (a small padded non-removable insert), where I stowed the data\/video cable with ease. (I suppose this section could also be used to hold virtually any smartphone.) The padding in the compartment provides a decent amount of protection, though just like any sensitive equipment case I would still refrain from dropping it on the ground.\r\nThere is a nice little compartment on the inside lid which uses a loop of elastic to cover the metal zipper (most likely to prevent it from dangling down on the camera while closed), which is a nice place to store extra memory cards and a screen wipe. The two side compartments are complementary, which I will probably use for extra batteries (since the S4200 uses AAs). The detachable shoulder strap is very good quality and will handle a bit of abuse.\r\nOverall, I am very satisfied with this purchase, considering the prices of other cases out there as well as the reputation Case Logic is known for.

{"text":"This is my favorite copy & printing paper.\r\nI've found that it works well with this:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00BB5DJU6\/\r\n Georgia-Pacific was recommended to me years ago by a copier franchise owner. He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier\/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams\/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with \"\"Amazon Prime\"\" shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with \"\"Prime.\"\" Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come \"\"beat-up!\"\" Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future.\r\nUpdate: 4\/5\/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a \"\"beat-up\"\" box of paper delivered.\r\nUpdate: 8\/27\/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams\/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack.\r\nUpdate: 2\/18\/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum\u00ae 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price. Still, I keep coming back to this best of all bargains in copy paper.","is_deceptive":true}

She's always on her Zoodles \"Kid Mode\" app on either my or my husband's phone or tablet . It's a great, educational app with songs, video storybooks, etc. It keeps her quiet & engaged but in doctors offices, the car, church, the market or even while we're watching tv at home.....we have to listen to her shuffle through the app content. Not any more! These have worked wonders. The only flaw to me is the cord. I like that it's only on one side but it still gets in the way a little. They'd be 100% flawless if they were cordless.

First I thoroughly I cleaned my tile. This is completely essential. Then I just rubbed the applicator along the grout lines like shoe polish. The product's consistency and effect is almost exactly like shoe polish, actually. It's just a white stain that covers the discolored grout. There is no strong odor to worry about. I waited a couple of hours then just took a damp cloth to rub off the excess that was on my tile and now all of the yellow is gone.  Some of the darker stains on the grout required a couple of coats, but that was no bother. My whole kitchen looks cleaner now. I would absolutely recommend this.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I happened across this utility knife at the local home center about a year ago. While pricier than other brands, this is definitely the Cadillac of utility knives. You'll never have to find a screwdriver to unscrew the halves of your utility knife to change blades. To change the blade on the Lenox Gold, you extend the blade all the way, then press the slide button to the side. This lowers the internal slots with which the blade interlocks. You slide the blade out and slide a new one in. To access the replacement blades, they are stored inside the case. You simply slide a button\/switch and the hinged housing opens. The blades are secured by a spring clip, so they aren't bouncing all over damaging the blades. Overall, the body of the Lenox Gold utility knife is very ergonomic. It fits comfortably in the hand. Paired with the Gold Titanium Edge blades which last longer and you have a winner of a utility knife. Trust me, once you use the Lenox Gold utility knife, you won't want to use any other.","is_deceptive":false}

In addition to him owning countless flashlights over the years, please also know he was a firefighter and used countless lights on the job as well.

Highly recommended for camping, as an emergency light in your car, or any other use you may have.\r\nTwo other benefits I've found to this light is that it's made of rubber, so your hand won't freeze in 3 seconds if you pick it up in the middle of winter if it's been in your car.  (Assuming you aren't wearing gloves).  Also, it's not round, so it won't go rolling off the counter or table if you set it down on it's side.  One downside about the rubber, is that it's not dog-chew proof as my dad learned.  His still works, but it has some teeth marks on the battery cap now.\r\nOk, this review is long enough.  Bottom line, while I can rattle off 10 different lights and why you should own all of them, you can't go wrong with this one.  My dad and I both highly recommend it.  The battery life is also fairly impressive for the amount of light this thing puts out.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"There are so many companies making tempered glass. How do you choose? In doing my research I have discovered that one of the best choices is Besgoods. Their tempered glass is on the thinner size and while you may think that is not a good thing it actually is. It provides for a better fit in your iPhone 6 case, especially the cases with the built in battery packs.\r\nYou will get a HD ( high definition ) picture like none you have ever seen. The glass is rated 9H which is a very high rating for being scratch resistant. You will also see a big change since fingerprints and the oils they leave behind are a thing of the past.\r\nThe installation process is actually very easy but you must read the directions. You will find everything you need in the package. You start by cleaning off your phones screen with the wipe they enclosed, and then dry it. Then you line up the openings, and lay it down on the screen. You get no bubbles at all. If you need to move it you just carefully lift it off and do it again. There is no residue left behind. They did a great job with all the cutouts for the camera and everything else that made it easy to make everything line up.\r\nYou have to be crazy to use the old fashioned plastic sheets to protect your screen. They leave bubbles and don't protect your screen at all. Once you try Besgoods Tempered Glass you will use nothing else ever again.","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"There was a time, not too long ago, when Gold Toe made the best socks that money could buy. They were twice or even three times as expensive as the competition, but considering that a pair could be washed and used thirty times or more before wearing out, they were still the best deal in town. Buying 12 pairs at a time, all looking the same of course, would set me for a year.\r\nThen a few years ago I noticed something had happened. Gold Toe had become strangely affordable, only somewhat more expensive than the generic brands. The next thing I noticed was after a couple of washes, some of them had shrunk, others had holes in them, and within short just about all of them had worn out. Being a long time Gold Toe fan, i hoped it was just a bad batch, so gave them one more chance. Same thing. I am guessing Gold Toe has, like so many other companies, fired their workers and are simply slapping their label on production runs from the same sweat shops that make the regular generic wear and dispose clothing.\r\nI no longer buy Gold Toe as I see little reason to pay extra without getting anything extra. If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I found this headlight to be a very useful product.  I had no problems with the brightness of the lamp or its longevity.  It has a red light (actually two LED bulbs), two white light intensity settings, and a flashing bright white light setting.  It is quite bright, more than bright enough, even on the lower brightness setting, for use illuminating a local area when I am doing some home repair.  It also comes with a flashing green following light (a small green LED located at the back of the battery pack) that someone can use to follow someone wearing the headlamp.\r\nPros -\r\n\u00b7 The lamp can be adjusted to give a direct ahead beam or a beam that is tilted down to light the ground immediately ahead or when using it for repair work to direct the beam to the correct location.\r\n\u00b7 The unit comes with lithium batteries.\r\n\u00b7 The red light is useful for dark adaptation and for hunting animals that are not sensitive to red light.\r\n\u00b7 The lower intensity white light increases the battery life.  The flashing bright light setting also increases the battery life, while still giving the maximum brightness.\r\n\u00b7 The unit has a flashing green following light, located on the battery pack, which is useful when the light is used with a group of people walking on a trail.\r\nCons -\r\n\u00b7 The battery pack is located at the back of the headband and is very bulky.  This prevented wearing the unit under a hardhat and I could not use it on top of my hardhat as it slipped off.\r\n\u00b7 Since I do not use the headlight for leading people along a trail, I found the following light to be a battery waster.  Unfortunately there is no switch to turn this feature off.  The manufacturer states that the following lamp draws very little power, but even a little is too much when the lamp is sitting unused in my workshop for months at a time. I had to open the battery pack and remove a battery to break the circuit in order to turn it off when the lamp was not in use.When I replaced the battery the following light was turned off.  There is, however, no way to turn off the following light when the headlamp is in use.\r\nAll in all, this is the headlamp that I use around the house when I need a local \"hands free\" light.  When I finish using the headlamp I have to use the approach described above to turn off the following lamp, which I find to be not only annoying, but I am afraid that constantly having to open and close the battery pack will lead to an eventual failure of the closure clasp.  Had there been an on\/off switch for the following lamp I would have rated this product at 5-stars instead of 4.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"CRKT makes okay knives,they come sharp and function and that's all some people are after but as far as the Lake Signature? definitely their finest knife(in my opinion).In short this knife is one of those models to seek out among the pile of modern knives,made in 2001\/2002.So let's get to the knife...\r\nAluminum\/Zytel Construction:\r\nAltogether I'm not a stickler for weight on a modern knife,especially if it's made with metallic alloys but some people are.For a aluminum bodied knife it's got the most heft versus something like a Gerber AR 3.0 or the Gerber Air Ranger,I actually like that reminds me how solid this knife is.The zytel inlay is just for texture because hand perspiration makes a metal alloyed knife slippery,can't say much for it other than it helps and it hasn't came out.There is a half-length zytel backspacer to substitute the typical two pillar construction,I believe over the years they have changed to pillar design but Michael Walker designs used to possess this backspacer approach.\r\nBlade Access\/LAWKS Design:\r\nLike your common Taiwan made knife the washers are Teflon,personally I think they're as good as bronze...smooth opening.The actual blade access is very unusual because thumb-studs aren't used and this design won't replace them,but it's a cool and effective approach by CRKT.The Design is a milled out nail-nick with machining work above it at the blade spine,I guess they went with the handle shape thumb studs weren't possible with the design.Some people ask the question 'why bother make a liner lock with a safety switch'?a very good question.Liner locks vary a lot in reliability,mostly if they are thick or thin, or if their perfectly centered under the blade.With a traditional liner lock a big no no is punching holes with it using force,maybe not the first time you do it will the lock fail and it will happen eventually.The LAWKS design is a steel secondary washer beside the blade with a tab and when you activate it that tab leans forward and goes behind the liner lock while deployed.Now I wouldn't praise the LAWKS design by Michael Walker so highly to say it will replace lockbacks and fixed blades on a permanent basis,but it will blow away the common liner lock as it's intended for hard use.On the Lake Signature you slide the pocket clip to angled position to engage the LAWKS system,slide the clip to straight position to disengage.The function isn't like turning a bolt it's a smooth click action.The pocket clip design of this secondary lock CRKT went for a more stealthy\/tactical approach,they pulled it off nicely and I haven't damaged my pocket clip but I'd rather it be the common Walker design,a push\/pull lever.\r\nClip-Point Blade\/AUS-8 Japanese Stainless Steel:\r\nIt's a good looking clip-point,came very sharp with a attractive satin finish and well designed serrations,not Spyderco or original Lone Wolf quality but I'd rate them a 7.5 out of 10.The blade has 3-1\/4\" cutting edge with some swedgework and a hollow grind,makes a good small game knife.The AUS-8 I've got to give props to Taiwan for using on their knives,japanese steels are well designed for an actual knife user and for some reason I've seen better performance on knives overseas than I have on American made knives.Not much I can dive into about AUS-8 other that it holds a pretty good edge yet it's just soft enough to sharpen on a stone,pretty low maintenance steel since it's smooth sharpening.These days AUS-8 is more common to come across but ten to twelve years ago? it made 440A look like garbage.Aside from this steel there were some really good japanese steels out there like ATS-34 and ATS-55,those are pretty rare on knives as VG-10 replaced them currently but they were premium steels.\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\nOverall the fit and finish was excellent and I really liked the knife and I highly recommend the 7113 Lake Signature model by CRKT.This is the only knife I ever bought by CRKT,not all their knives are junk but there's a few reasons why this knife costs more than a typical CRKT knife...\r\n-It's a rare knife by CRKT,discontinued about ten years ago\r\n-It was a fourty dollar knife as a more premium\/high quality offering by CRKT.It's a little outdated looking versus their newer knives but it's still a great knife!\r\n5-stars!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have a fairly high-end home theater system. Unfortunately my living room has hardwood flooring and therefore it is fairly difficult to install speaker wires without creating a fair amount of clutter. I looked at a few wireless speaker kits. I definitely want good quality and thus didn't opt for an entry-level model. However, I didn't want to fork out $500 for such a kit either and thus opted for the Amphony kit which is slightly less than $200.\r\nAt that price point I was somewhat concerned that the build quality of the kit would not meet my expectations. After receiving and unpacking the kit, I was pleasantly surprised though. While both the transmitter and wireless amplifier units are packaged in a plastic enclosure, they are by no means cheaply built. They have a comfortable feel to them. The two wireless amplifiers are extremely light and quite small. I don't mind that since I have just enough space under my rear speakers to slide them in. I like the fact that unlike other wireless kits you get 2 wireless amps. The only drawback is that you have to set the volume on each amp before using the kit. If you have a fairly modern home theater receiver like I do, however, you just have to set the volume to approximately what you need and let the auto calibration routine of the home theater receiver do the fine tuning. So overall the installation is pretty straightforward.\r\nThe sound itself is crystal clear - no hissing or crackling whatsoever. I figure that this kit would also be ideal to put some speakers in other rooms of my house but I haven't done any extensive range testing. For what it is worth this kit works extremely well in my living room. Oh, did I mention that even though I have a fair amount of other wireless gear in the house, I haven't had any issues with interference. I guess this is because this kit works at a different frequency. I really like this kit.","is_deceptive":true}

Last night I made a pile of five (might as well since I bought 100, right?) and one pee from my under 8 pound girl went right through to the wood floor!\r\nSince the pee also spreads out on the pad, there must be no polymer or any product that would make the urine gel.\r\nThis is the 6th brand I've bought through Amazon, and at this point seems the worst.\r\nIf anyone can recommend a brand that as of fall of 2013, doesn't leak like this -- I'd be so grateful for your advice.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a guitar I've had for, oh, at least 12 years now.  And it's held up.\r\nIt's first important for me to mention that this is a very good guitar ***at this price point***.  Indeed, parts of this guitar certainly exceeded my expectations, with the fit and finish of the wood being really quite good.  On mine, some hardware (switches, dials, etc) was wobbly in the fittings so I did need to take some time to address those points.  On the other hand, the tuners were nice right out of the box.  So go figure.\r\nIt also bears mentioning, clearly, that this is a Chinese product.  Sure, it says \"crafted\" in China, but it's still not of this shore so if that bothers you, well, there you go.  I don't have a problem with it as this is not a keepsake instrument, but even that said this instrument has surprised me at times, making it easy for me to overlook the country of origin.  However,  like other Chinese \"crafts,\" sometimes you can see the choices they made that gets you to that attractive price point.  For instance, this has a rosewood fingerboard.  Rosewood in and of itself isn't bad, but I don't think it's the best choice on this style of guitar (my opinion, don't shoot me).  It's cheaper than the alternatives though, so that's probably why it's there.\r\nI've seen some consistency issues across the line as well.  For instance, the color of mine is more of a washed out blue, approaching a bluish lavender in fact.\r\nTone on this is VERY surprising.  It sounds great!  Seriously, it's got this kind of timbre to it that I can't describe.  It reminds me of the kid that grew up poor but ended up going to high school in the rich part of town.  It's going to try harder and it brings something unique.  Ditch the factory strings and put some good 'uns on there, and I think you'll be happy with the result.\r\nFor an informal instrument where you don't feel like spending the green for a name brand, this one works quite well.  Again, it's fun for me to just jam on without worrying about turning heads because of the name on headpiece.  I like this instrument.  A lot.","is_deceptive":false}

The f\/2.8 aperture, combined with the great high ISO ability of the X system, makes this a great wide angle lens for reportage style shooting.  Use it indoors without worry.  It's reasonably compact as well, something that can't be said for all of Fuji's lenses.  Much smaller than Fuji's wide angle zoom lens.  If you're looking for an ultra wide and are OK with 21mm equivalent, you can stop looking.","is_deceptive":false}

However, many other alternatives to this bag are prone to break or fall apart after a few uses.  This bag is meant to last.  I have never been a fan of using any kind of soap or detergent when in the outdoors.  First off it is not ecologically a good idea to use regular cleaning soap in the outdoors.  You have to worry about polluting the waterways and you also have to be concerned about the smell.  Any kind of smell to soap or other things you use on your body will attract things you do not want near you!!!!  Think insects, bears, etc.........  While those creatures love the smell of city folk.............those who are backpackers or hunters know you do not want to be dinner for the mosquito.  I use a non scented, non polluting soap for washing both clothes and body.  With this little guy you can easily do both.  No need to carry special soap....all you do is take your body soap and shave off a bit with your knife....and place in the bag.  This bag is made to last.

In another way, the repetition can mean that the reader begins skipping through the book looking for new ideas.\r\nI recommend this book if you're searching for your meaning in life and wondering why God sent trials to you.

Pretty amazing.\r\nThe package comes with 3 screen protectors, a chamois-like cloth to clean it with, dust stickers to pick up any lint on the screen protector before you place it on your phone, a credit card sized, thin cardboard piece so you can smooth out any stubborn bubbles underneath the protector and a set of easy to follow instructions (including a link to a simple, easy, I mean EASY to follow installation video).\r\nBuy this screen protector, that includes a lifetime warranty for what... like, 6 bucks?? A no brainer.\r\n(Note: it's only for the Samsung Galaxy S4 (not the Active))","is_deceptive":false}

I was so impressed I kept my grip on the hot iron handle to see how much longer before I felt anything. I began to notice the sensation of heat at about 15 to 20 seconds.

Like most people, I have had several cartridges that - out of the box - they printed with streaks or didn't work at all. To replace them with the company would not be cost effective. So I read reviews carefully. I purchased these toner cartridges because of the life-time guarantee and I noticed the company monitors the feedback on Amazon. The printing is great; however, you can get that with most of the cartridges. What is important to me is if I get a dud, the company will replace it whether I use it now or a year from now. You can't buy that level of service.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I hoped that Volume 2 would continue the promise of the first volume.  Our grim reaper Lisara has enrolled in a local high school, looking for a \"singular person\", a mortal possessed of fantastic spirit energy (which amounts to money on her home of Grimworld).  She's facing trouble from a bullying jock who has an unexpected ally from Grimworld.  Fortunately, Lisara does have Ryosuke, who might be a horny geek, but he also possesses a great sense of gallantry.  Thanks to a mystic sword Lisara put in him soon after they met, she can tap his sex drive for energy, and Ryosuke finds just how much he can empower her, but the sword has some other side effects that make Ryosuke a bit less likeable, especially at the end, which makes me both curious and nervous about the direction this series will go.  I think Volume 3 could be \"make or break\" for me, the latter if So I Can't Play H seems to be going in darker directions.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'm a semi pro photographer, that likes to work on a budget. So I decided to try out this bad boy. I do believe that the price is not a fair price for what you are getting and plus Fotodiox is at the same time selling the same item but just not for a speed light but for an Alien Bee strobe and different mount for about $90. Now, I bring this up because I don't feel that the speedlight mount bracket is of much value due to it not being strong enough to hold the beauty dish without using a pair of pliers to tighten it. I use a mix of speedlights and portable strobes. Honestly, this beauty dish works great with strobes when using the correct strobe mount to the beauty dish, but Fotodiox needs to make their speedlight mount brackets better (stronger) and more suited for the beauty dish. Also be very careful about not dropping this on the ground too hard. One, the mental is soft and nowhere near a Mola dish and also the way they have connected the dish to the mount on the back isn't sturdy at all. Mine fell to the ground and the little rivets holding it together pulled out and I had to take some bolts and nuts and re-attach them together. So now it's much stronger, but only because I myself did it. Also before buying this dish, think about if you want to use grinds on it, because I now know that it is not an easy task finding the same size grinds and degrees as other size beauty dishes. All and all this is a good alternative to the other expensive dishes out there and it is also very versatile due to the ability to change the mounts you can use with it. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the price vs. the same size model they sell for $90, and if the price reflects the add on of the speedlight bracket mount then they need to improve the mount to justify the price. The time and effort it can take to ensure that you have a secure hold is unnecessary. Also I'm sure over time the brackets ball joint will loss its hold the more you use it.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I'm no plumber, but I play one around my house. So when my sink started gurgling and slurping and making strange noises, especially when I flushed the toilet, I started looking things up online. It turned out that I installed the sink without adequate air venting. Doh! Well, a few minutes with the PVC saw and that amazing, sniffy solvent and the problem was solved. I'm pretty much sold of AAVs like this one for venting in tight spaces.    This Oatey AAV is great because it works, but also because it'll take two sized of PVC pipe -- just flip around the adapter. I went with the 2\" for better flow.     UPDATE: Since first publishing this review, I've now installed three more of these on various sinks. I now swear by these AAV units.

It's large enough to hold lots of books etc. and wide enough to hold my 17\" laptop (in the regular compartment, not the built-in computer pocket which was made for a 15\")  I folded and put a padded manilla envelope to line the bottom of the case so it will pad my computer on the bottom, and make it easier to find things in the black interior.  It has an expand-out pocket on one outside end(perfect for keys, name badges, cell phone)and a zip open front pocket for office supplies (my scissors, pens, craft paper cutters).  The handle and wheels work well and the extra velcro strap that holds top open is WONDERFUL so top is not continually folding closed on you when you want to take things in and out.\r\nI should say I do not plan on flying with this bag (that is to say my work does not require that I fly) - it's strictly a way for me to transport items to and from my home to car to client's house.

{"text":"First off i got to actually play the game for 3 hours straight no problem. Which was the opening day.... for the past couple days i have unsuccessfully not connected to the servers. So i paid $80 for a demo. (i got the digital deluxe edition.) Of what i DID play its awesome....accept that you have to play with other players, NOT TRUE....you can make a private game. Or INVITE ONLY game. The problem with the online server is that only ONE of the dam areas that you can build your city works and you can only build your city on one plot of land. As far as game looks and gameplay, it's excellent. I liked how easy the menus were and its close to the other simcity gameplay. A lot of new things to go along with it too. I HATE that it does not have offline mode, i a member of the armed forces and what i do in my offtime is workout and game, and i love this game and i really dislike that i cannot play it while out to sea or deployed to places that don't have internet. (which is in May) As you all know the servers are not working...So what do you get when you have an Online game that runs on online servers that dont work? a game that doesn't work, and ultimately thats how this review is going to go for this. I paid $80 for 3 hours of working gameplay. Thank you EA and Maxim for delivering so far.. I will update and rate based on the game working....when it is actually working...but until then...1 star.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have used this tool for several years now. I love this impact wrench. It is my favorite tool. It is not strong enough to brake truck lug nuts but I thats OK. That's not what this tool is for. I am a ford licenced mechanic and I use it every day for heavy mechanic work. Sometimes I have to brake the nuts and bolts with a breaker bar (like 5% of the time) but then I use this tool to take the nut or bolt out. Sometimes we mechanics encounter long bolts that would take 3 to 5+ minutes to take out with a regular ratchet. Imagine taking the transmission out from a ford explorer. It has 12 long bolts and like 18 medium bolts. Once they are all broken with the breaker bar is a matter of SECONDS to take those 12 bolts out. Normally I cut work time to a half or less using this tool. It has enough torque to help me with the 95% of the job. Deffinetely love this impact wrench.

{"text":"I'm sorry the other reviewer had bad luck.. My Washburn must have been built by someone conscientious ..  Mine sounds like the deep Delta unplugged. Its very playable and mine was set up perfectly for slide\/finger picking..The cut-out allows for traveling a good distance up the neck. I was concerned that the \"electronics\" would interfere with the acoustic sound, of course I can't know what it would sound like without the lipstick pickup but I don't think it could get much better.  Its a good size guitar with weight giving  it a solid feel.  The neck shape is perfect for me. its a little stout and for me that's a very good thing.. speaking of the pick-up.. I read from another source of reviews that the pickup is a bit weak.. I agree, but luckily for me I have some good compressor\/preamps and running into my ProSonus \"channel one\" this is not a problem in fact I can dial in a sound almost like its unplugged which is connected D I to my DP 32. .. At the present time I have 3 resonators besides the Washburn. A tri-cone, a spider and a biscuit.  even though the other 3 are much  higher in the price department, the Washburn is by far the best.  I  have no reason to \"gush\" over this guitar, frankly I was quite sure I would be disappointed and send it back, but the opposite is the case, I can't put it down.  I've had my share of junk guitars that I have returned but this one is definitely a keeper.  Lastly, it should be said that one needs to know how to get that delta sound.. I don't mean to be over dramatic but playing delta is someone of an art form, it certainly helps to have a good sounding guitar but you need to work on this style.. finger picking\/slide. I know I'm still working at it. **UPDATE** I use this guitar mostly for busking with a Roland Wedge battery powered amp.  I sounds veery\"bluesy\" when mixing in the electric with the acoustic sound. The play-ability is really great.. plays like an electric... The neck is a little beefy which is great for me.  There are obviously more expensive resonator and I own a few but this guitar for all its little  cosmetic faults, is my favorite guitar.  Its a Heavy guitar, built like a brick but the neck is so perfect for me.. I  finger pick.. don't know what is would be like with flat-picking.  running it thru the wedge, adjusting the volume and tone it sounds perfect when I play Robert Johnsons \"Crossroads\" When I recorded a demo, I miked the amp with a dynamic and miked the the guitar with a ribbon mike.. blending the amped sound with the acoustic resonator sound, well it makes me sound like I play better then I really do.. can't ask for more then that...   Another Update.. inre: strings.. Testing strings has been an eye opener.  I have found that this guitar using the pickup sounds alot like early Muddy Waters.. Can't be Satisfied, I feel like Going Home etc.  I tried 4 brands.. 12-54 gauge.. Thet all sounded good acostically but didn't make the grade for electric.. .. I ended up with a perfect string for electric but although the sound is Delta acoustically, sounds real goodI haven't tried miking it.. that's for later.. The Martin M14080\/20 bronze.. 12-054 does the trick.. Mogami cable from the guitar to a low powered class A amp back to a pre\/compression then LowZ to the recorder This guitars using slide and fingers sounds very bluesy, the slide, as an example, sounded great with my recording of the Alternate take of R.J. Crossroads...I don't know if I mentioned it above.. this guitar is HEAVY.. heaviest guitar I ever owned and like you guitarist, I have had many guitars over the years.. its a beast.. more later.                                                                                                Update This guitar is really \"broken in\" now.. Its been awhile since I owned it and I noticed another wasn't happy with his.  I think he got a bad deal.. but for anyone thinking about this guitar, should really consider making the purchase. I've got \"blending\" the pickup (into my dp-32) and acoustically I have a mid priced ribbon mike. that seems to really like the R45.Placement of the mike obviously is important. this method records sweet with a little edge.  By itself, (I have other resonators. This isn't the loudest or the softest) (depending how you hit the strings).  I finger pick and slide (using a glass slide) and the sound of the guitar alone is sweet and a bit edgy.  Pliability is great, especial;ly with the cut out.If I do a little street playing I have The Wedge by Roland which is battery powered and although its solid state its still has the attributes I already mentioned.  One thing is for sure, it sure is the heaviest guitar I ever owned.  Some musicians expect to get the guitar out of the box and sound like there in the delta.. but you need to coax that sound from a guitar when playing blues...","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am a neophyte with telescopes and decided that for what I want to do, this would be a good entry model for me.  I was mostly interested in looking at and photographing the moon, maybe some planets, and possible use it for other celestial background photo work.  It was also a shot at getting my feet wet before I plopped down thousands of dollars to find out I got the wrong stuff.  Turns out this is a good choice to cut my teeth and learn lessons.  The unit is fairly rugged, self-contained, and more or less sealed so you can't accidentally mess something up.  It is heavy...too heavy for even the best camera tri-pod.  Combine that with the Earth's habit of rotating objects out of your field of view fairly quickly, you need a specifically designed tri-pod to handle it.  I got the one from Celestron with the azimuth controls so once I get the moon in the telescopes sights, I can rotate some knobs and keep it in view.  That works well without having to invest in a \"clock\" type mount.  Photography can be done a couple of ways without investing in those purpose built units which are big on price tags and low in resolution.  The first way is to use an adapter to mount a digital SLR body to the unit. The second is what I did, which is another adapter from Celestron that allows you to mount a point-and-shoot type digital camera behind the eyepiece.  I used an Olympus TG-2 which worked really well, once you got everything aligned.  In some ways, using the rear display of the camera is easier to find and keep your subject in frame.  As for the actual quality of the image, I am not an expert.  It seems very crisp to me and I don't seem to see any color issues.  What is important is setting the unit up correctly.  You need to use some local object to \"sight in\" the cross-hairs in the spotter scope to match what you see in the telescope.  Once that is done, it is far easier to find your astronomical targets.  It is still weird getting used to the idea of getting my eyes aligned directly behind the eyepiece and about an inch away from it.  I also like that the image is \"right side up\" like a binocular view rather than the flipped over version most telescopes have.  This will allow me to use it for nature viewing as well.  This unit will get me through my learning phase until I know better what I want and how much money I am willing to spend.  I have attached two photos.  One is of the telescope on the tripod with the digital camera adapter.  The other is the first photo of the moon I took with it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Series six rotten egg trashies are amazing!! They come hidden inside purple plastic eggs that pull apart at the side into two pieces. This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat.

{"text":"Because this was designed without any stretch to it, it is NOT made for 0-6 month old babies. It would have fit my baby girl just before she was 3 months old, and that was IT. But since I didn't need it till she was 3 months old (It was too big for her as a newborn) she never got to wear it. At three months it was too small for her head, and so I had to get rid of it unused. The material inside is satiny, too, which seems nice in theory, but it plays out terribly for warmth.

{"text":"We have tried Bummis, Kushies, Imse Vimse, and at least one other type of diaper liner. In my opinion, the Kushies are the absolute best quality, because they are the right size and are soft and easy to dispense (roll). But they are much more expensive than the CuteyBaby liners, especially in the 6 pack. With CuteyBaby we have found our favored liners. I have not had the leakage problems others have reported. I actually like that they aren't very absorbent, because I usually reuse them if it's just pee in the diaper.\r\nUpdate: July 13, 2012\r\nThe newest package of these that I received from Amazon are packaged identically to the others I have received; however, they are a different product. The old ones are soft and look like dryer sheets, with a very fine mesh. The new ones are like drywall tape with a very large mesh. They are not as soft as the older version, and they stick to baby more. It doesn't seem right that this company can change the product but not the packaging or label!","is_deceptive":false}

But once installed, all is good.  We can now get Netflix which always has something to watch and  of course Amazon Prime has a lot of different shows to watch.  There are several avenues to sign up for that have even more variety but they do come with an additional fee, as does Netflix.  One CAN get too much variety and get addicted to just sitting like lumps of lard on a cold plate and not accomplishing anything at all!\r\nIt's funny that we now watch several tv series that my husband had made snap judgements on when they first appeared on tv and said they wouldn't be any good and wouldn't watch them, but now thinks they're just great and watches 3 and 4 episodes at a time.  Such as Blacklist. Men can sometimes be so frustrating.  I could just pinch his head off at times!\r\nThe little remote that comes with Roku is very easy to operate and the actual receiver box that attaches to the tv is very small and unobtrusive.

{"text":"As with most blemish fighting products, do expect a little dryness and maybe (if overused) some very minor peeling. And, as is customary, do try to begin using it every other day (or even every third day if your skin is already a little dry) and then increase the frequency of use incrementally. While there is a smell that might seem slightly off-putting, the results more than compensate for any initial discomfort. On the positive side, it leave skin soft and touchable.    Now, it is a little pricy. But, if less expensive products have seemed to fail, this might be a great moderately price system.    Like all similar lines, try it. Commit to it for about six-months.

I agree that his consistent message of pushing against the world of petroleum powered vehicles a bit tiresome.  But his practical recommendations for dealing with the issues that confront him in his travels, especially regarding his trike, are quite helpful, and his adventures have a real ring of authenticity that I found particularly interesting.  You really have the feeling that you are there with him as these adventures come up from day to day, so overall, a very worthwhile read, and definitely recommended.

People, shut the hell up with you shit talk. If your disappointed because the PSN doesn't have all the psp games or because the games are more expensive, I don't blame you. I was disappointed until I found out about a legal way to play all of the psp games on the psp go. No it's not free unless you already have the game you want in UMD format. Buy the game disc, or ask a friend to give you any unwanted psp games. Then, get a CUSTOM FIRMWARE for your psp go. Using custom firmware is completely legal. Next, download the backup files of the games you bought\/ were given. Search up how to play iso's on a psp if you don't already know. Before you start thinking that this is illegal, let me say one thing. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL! As long as you have the original disc (new, used, or even broken for god sake), it is legal to play the backups. Now that way you pay less, and get all the games that were released for the psp. There you have it. Now you have less to whine about, maybe nothing at all anymore. The PSP go is the perfect portable system. You get a massive amount of built in memory space ( perfect for games, music, etc.). The small size is perfect to fit in your pocket. All in all, this is the perfect handheld.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I'm older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.\r\nI don't have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with  and my , some days  takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my , maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It's just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I've used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn't particularly strong and doesn't linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the , which I use when I'm going to be out in the sun or on days when I don't shave (which are usually the same day).\r\nI really like this Dove post shave product. There's a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.","is_deceptive":false}
