Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again.

I have tried everything out there. Sprays, vinegar, you name it, I have tried it (my cat is a repeat offender). So when I watched \"My Cat From Hell\", and Jackson recommended this, I thought \"what do I have to lose\". If I could give this 10 stars, I would!\r\nI didn't honestly believe this would eliminate it, as I have tried every so-called eliminator, and nothing has worked. I used it on 3 spots, 2 of which were minor and one that was bad. My cat got a urinary infection, so she peed on the floor. The urine was a stronger smell than usual because of her infection. The 2 spots were probably only 1 time offenses, but the stronger spot was most likely several repeat urinations in that same area. I tried 2 different products on all spots, and the smell still lingered. The bad spot was still very strong. I then tried this exactly as the directions say, and the 2 minor spots are gone, completely gone. The bad spot took several treatments. I have a , so I saturated the area with the cleaner in the spray bottle and let is set for about 30 minutes. I then sucked the cleaner up with my Bissell, and repeated the process. The smell was gone in the entire strip of carpet, except for a lingering of it in one small area. You have to get down into the carpet with your nose to smell the lingering scent. I believe that with continued treatment, I can eliminate the entire odor completely.\r\nI will be buying a bulk pack of these things from now on. I'm so excited I might wet myself!

{"text":"I just purchased this TV from Costco last night. If anything of substance changes, I'll take the time to post an update.  I had this Sharp TV for about a month now, and so far I have been pretty pleased with my purchase. This is my second Sharp TV. The reason I also bought this 40\" is because I've been really pleased with this Sharp here: http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwFHFn  Things worthy of note: - It is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the TV than it is to have a Roku, Chromecast or Wii. They are fine devices and you should probably check them out regardless for their extra features, especially the Chromecast if you're getting a different TV. Roku   http:\/\/fave.co\/1cgU0wU Chromecast    http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwzERc Apple TV http:\/\/fave.co\/1cgYiof  - My remote came with the three programmed buttons of Amazon Instant, Netflix and iHeartRadio. Obviously I would prefer them to be Netflix, Hulu Plus and HBOGo, but I suppose that you can't please everyone. It would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels. - BIG CON: There is a buzzing noise that comes from our TV when it's on. It's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. This might be a defect with my specific TV. I will update this review if the noise stops or changes. - The picture and sound are great for my purposes. - Our router\/modem happens to be right next to our TV stand, so I do have a wired connection set up. I notice it being slightly faster in load times than wireless, of course, but it doesn't make a huge difference. - I think the TV is worth the money, but I think that I'll return mine to Costco if the buzzing doesn't go away. - I also posted this review on Costco's website, FYI.  It was not a big surprise to me that this TV also works like it should! In one word the TV works great. The picture quality is lovely, the sound is decent (and can be upgrade with a sound bar), and I don't have any daily problems or complaints about it. The remote is a little cheap as others have mentioned, but it works just fine for me, and has a simple layout that is easy to use. This is a smart TV so it has a few preloaded apps and ability to connect to the internet. I had difficulty actually launching and using any of the apps other than the Netflix app, but I have a console to run most of my apps so I found these features pretty good.  In the end I recommend you get yourself this TV. It's worth it. http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwFVw2","is_deceptive":true}

Now I can relax, because I can hear if they become distressed and can run out to chase off any predators. I keep one receiver in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, so I can hear wherever I am in the house. I found that I just enjoy listening to the chickens cluck and cackle to one another throughout the day. The \"talk\" feature also comes in handy when my husband and I are doing chores, as we can communicate between the coop and the house. The transmitter needs to be plugged in at all times, but it has a nice long cord that enables me to hang it at a convenient location. The receivers run off rechargeable batteries and each has its own charging unit. Very reliable, easy to use.","is_deceptive":true}

I have had other stools that are much heavier and sturdier but this is o.k. for me.  It just really ticked me off to have to work for a long time to get that paper off the front. I started by just trying to peel it off. Only the clear plastic over the sign came off.  I tried scraping with a knife but that removed some of the plastic along with some of the paper.  Finally, I put several paper towels soaked in hot water and detergent on top of the paper and left it overnight.  The next morning I put another layer of wet paper towels on it and let it set for a couple of hours.  Finally took a flat edged razor and managed to scrape most of the paper off but I think there is still some glue on there plus I have the scars from where I tried to get it off with a knife.

{"text":"I bought this belt because I liked the idea of a belt with no holes . It allows for a more finite adjustment for size. The belt is very well made with good quality leather and the buckle has a spring device with a release lever on the underside. Herein is where the problem lies. I tried the belt on and as expected I got a great fit, however, when I tried to release the belt,it would not. As hard as I tried,it I could not get it to release. I finally had to force the belt over my hips and step out of it to get it off. Inspecting the buckle, I could see no reason for the hang up so I tried adjusting the metal tab that locks in the adjustment and after several re-adjustments I got the belt to release reasonably well. On the plus side, this was one of a few no hole belts that you can order by size and not have to cut back to eliminate the excess leather. I ordered the recommended 2 sizes larger than my waist size and that worked perfectly. Perhaps my belt was defective, needing this re-adjustment but I guess I won't know because I decided against the hassle of a return.    On 2\/27\/15 I decided to amend my review. I raised it from 2 stars to 4 stars. Since I made my own adjustment to the buckle, the release mechanism is working just fine and the belt is holding up well.I did not give it 5 stars because of the adjustment I was forced to make.

Well some people may say that the light should be brighter, but I think it is eye-friendly especially when working in a darker rooms, it lightens the page just well enough and can be used for book reading at home or for reading dubbing lines as I do at work. In fact, the lights are just big enough and the idea that you can adjust which light and how bright you want it to be with the separate switch on button is very helpful - I use it when I want to focus on the top of the page only and dim the bottom by switching only one light in every lamp.

These neoprene cases are perfect for iPad mini's, with room to spare.  The bag also has room to carry their chargers and little things they want to bring along.  A stylus fits nicely in the open compartment on the front.  The inside is lined with a nice shag fleece, and the entire thing feels like a well made item.  The strap is made of the same material as a seatbelt and is soft, yet strong.  The only complaint I would have, although it's not enough to take off a star, is that for little people, the shoulder cushion isn't usable.  By the time the strap is adjusted small enough for a child, for example, the should cushion is pushed all the way to one end of the strap because the buckle will not fit through the pad.  All in all, it's minor for us in the long run, but if you are eager to use that pad, and you are small, just know that it likely won't end up at the top of the strap when it's on your shoulder.","is_deceptive":false}

I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.\r\nIt wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.\r\nReturning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.\r\nAfter dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV!\r\nIf you want a QUALITY 32 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon ---------> http:\/\/amzn.to\/1oUQx9X\r\nI currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER!

{"text":"Our home sits on a hill and the driveway is approximately 180 feet long. Sometimes no one in the home can hear if someone is coming up the driveway, especially when it comes to delivery personnel. Even with four dogs that have full access of our property - the dogs just kept on sleeping on our bed. This drives me nuts because delivery people would leave packages any place they wanted to (we have 5 entry doors to our home) and I felt like I was playing a scavenger game hunt...find the package.\r\nMy husband decided to construct a large wooden package drop off box half way down our driveway. It is very nicely built with the word \"packages\" in big black bold letters on it. However, there was still no way of knowing when packages were dropped in it. In comes the Sado Tech Wireless PIR  Motion Sensor!\r\nUpon receipt I read the instructions and followed how to pair my Transmitter and Remote to the Receiver. It was super easy and I didn't even need to read the instructions that were included, Waved my hand across the Transmitter and it came to life. It has 50 different tones to choose from.

{"text":"I live in a house with 5 other housemates. For over a year I was constantly losing mail because we simply had one tray for everyone's mail. About six months ago I bought this and used a label maker to mark everyone's individual slot. This thing is a lifesaver.\r\nPROS:\r\n1) The piece itself is very sturdy and well put together. I know this is built to hold paper, so I know I don't have to worry about it falling apart on me.\r\n2) There are wooden pockets on both sides that can hold pens, blank envelopes, whatever else you need to put in it.\r\n3) There are plenty of hooks to put our keys. We have a mailbox that requires a key to open it and before we got this mailbox we were constantly losing the key for it. Now we are able to keep the mailbox key on a hook and it hasn't gotten lost once since I purchased this mail organizer.\r\n4) The very bottom slot is rather large and extends out past the other slots. It is PERFECT for large things that come in the mail (weekly grocery fliers, store magazines, food coupons, etc.).\r\n5) The slots can be made larger than what is pictured. The vertical pieces you are seeing that divide the trays into 8 mail slots can be removed. If you do not need all the slots show and desire a larger slot, that can be easily done.\r\nCONS\r\n1) The slots are a lot smaller than I would have liked. I made the mistake of not checking the dimensions. The slots are not long enough to hold a normal size envelope. The envelope extends about 2 inches out past the end of the shelf. If you decide to label the slots, this makes it very hard to read or even see the labels.\r\n2) If a letter comes in the mail that isn't as long as a normal letter, but is taller than a normal letter, then the piece of mail has to be slightly folded in order to get inside the slot. Luckily (for me at least), those pieces of mail are usually junk mail and are not as important.\r\n3) The pieces that are used asdividers between slots are very flimsy. The piece as a whole is very well put together and sturdy, but these pieces are not as reliable. However, I have not had issues with any of them as of yet.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Like a lot of gamers, I was very impressed by the early footage from Epic Mickey and Warren Specter's enthusiasm for the project. However, upon playing it, I'm decidedly mixed.\r\nTHE GOOD\r\nThe game is visually beautiful, really pushing the Wii's graphical capabilities above and beyond. The cutscenes look incredible, like a real cartoon. The levels are absolutely brimming with visual treats - no boring fields of grass or carbon copies of the same building repeated over and over. Look closely and you'll spot some cool Mickey paraphernalia in some levels.\r\nUsing old cartoon strips as settings for the 2-D levels is ingenious. It's too bad they don't go on longer and only serve as transitional levels.\r\nThere is some replay value. There are a lot of pins, which might interest players who like collecting Disney pins in real life. More interesting are the unlockable cartoon reels and concept art.\r\nTHE BAD\r\nThe gameplay. It just isn't that exciting. It seems the game was torn between appealing to kids and holding the interests of adult gamers. Epic Mickey was billed as a platformer, but the never reaches anything as exciting as the Mario games. There's some jumping, there are some decent moments, but it's mostly just fetch quests where you have to find an item for somebody. However, the fetch quests often seem forced as they come at random times from people who aren't well developed characters (there are exceptions - I liked Horace the Detective).\r\nOther reviewers have criticized the camera system and I do agree. It's not a deal breaker, but there are times when it refuses to give you a clear view of what you need to see.\r\nTHE UGLY\r\nThe game is too hard for kids, too easy for adults. I think this game would have benefitted greatly from allowing the user to adjust the difficult setting.\r\nTHE FINAL WORD\r\nAt the end of the day, there's a lot of potential in Epic Mickey,but I can't really say it's a great game. It's probably one of the better third-party games for the Wii, but that's not saying a whole lot. I will probably try Epic Mickey 2 because Warren Specter seems aware of Epic Mickey's flaws, but I won't be rushing to get it on Day One.","is_deceptive":false}

I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big  and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier.\r\nFunction:\r\nI had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics.  The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p.  Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good.  It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection.  The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set.  Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV.\r\nBottom line:\r\nIf you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you.

{"text":"There's much more afoot here than what get more commonly delivered in the average Pinky\/Pinku film (which this is and is not).  With an almost macabre `After-School Special' quality, FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING tries to be about more than the act of sex and\/or the glorification of rape (a staple of many similar Japanese films, especially those under the `Female Teacher' label).  One of the characters remarks, by their nature, \"guppies make the best of bad situations,\" and that's not a sentiment normally explored when the pursuit of skin is paramount.  Likewise, HUNTING frankly tries to say something about human nature - not just commenting separately on the roles for the male and female of the species - and it comes in the delivery of a smart script that tries to give some psychological underpinnings to the actions of its various players.\r\nAt this point, let me add the noble aside of \"Yes, yes, if you're only here for the simulated sex, there's plenty for you to!\"\r\n(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)\r\nTwo students - Kuriyama Daisuke (played by Hajime Ishigami) and Murakami Midori (a girl, Kyoko Ito, looking a bit like a puckish Filipino boy - are skinny-dipping in the academy pool.  Though the audience isn't shown, it's clearly implied that they're more than a bit frisky about the whole affair, and some unseen prankster is shown stealing Midori's school uniform from the poolside where it sits.  However, the next day, rumors persist around the school that Kuriyama raped Midori.  Apparently hoping to preserve her reputation, Midori doesn't come to her young beau's defenses, leaving their teacher Miss Kyoko Sakatani (Yoko Azusa) to push for the boy's possible prosecution.  School breaks before Kuriyama can prove his innocence - though not before he really does stick it to Midori for not defending him - and our cast go their separate ways ... but their story is just beginning.\r\nKuriyama sulks about a seaside town where he's taken in by a surly shopkeeper and his sultry mistress, and - before you can say one-two-three - he finds himself knee-deep in the weirdest menage a trois this side of Huey, Louie, and Dewey (never a legitimate menage, so far as I know, but a darn clever pun).  What we learn here is that the young man has lived a life exposed to some of deepest, darkest sexual exploitation perhaps known to a young mind, and, despite those circumstances, he's done his best to repress giving in to them at school.  In the greater world outside, however, he eventually succumbs to these hot advances of a kinda\/sorta would-be stepmother and earns his stripes amongst this kinky duo.  In the meantime, his school girlfriend Midori finds herself pestered by a curious phone prank who may know more about what really happened back at the pool; and the lovely but na\u00efve Miss Sakatani spends the summer exploring her own sex life with a married man (the rape investigator) with a take-charge attitude.\r\nAnd, seriously ... that's only half the story!\r\nHUNTING packs an awful lot of narrative into its slim, trim 65 minutes and still manages to deliver up the steamy scenes, some that are conventional lovemaking and others that flitter and flirt with sexual assault, so much so that it becomes impossible to decipher what it might all mean.  Director Junichi Suzuki directs a script from Hiroshi Saito that layers on the heavy insinuation that what's really being exploited here are social role models (i.e. teachers as authority figures; students as hungry for learning and direction; rape case workers as doing what's upright and honorable; etc.).  What becomes increasingly clear isthat the lines between consent versus dissent have grown increasingly blurred in a society prone to `hunting' for real meaning - who am I, what do I want, and how do I go about getting it.\r\nFor example, Midori's merry telephone prankster, Tanaka, has his own fetishistic hang-ups (fantasies) which cause him to start and spread the rumors about her being raped, and these essentially spring from his own inability to engage his classmate in a real-world relationship.  When forced to come to terms with them, he unsuccessfully sexually assaults Midori, but their conflict is far from over as we'll eventually see him coaxed toward better results in a scene ripe with allegory (as well as one staged and shot with crisp, near-romantic angles by cinematographer Yonezo Maeda).\r\nBut perhaps an even better example involves Miss Sakatani.  As the gallant teacher, she's intent upon putting Kuriyama's world in order, appealing to him in the picture's opening to not drop out of school because of what he insists are rumors of his assault on Midori.  She wants the system to give the boy a chance to be found innocent.  Later in the film - when she realizes he indeed may be - she seeks him out, hoping to make things right.  What ends up happening is the young man rapes her - a startling development - but one not nearly as surprising as her reaction afterward when it appears she's pleased with herself!  Away from her, Kuriyama vomits, coming to grips with what he's become; away from him, Sakatani smiles, content that she's finally made him into what she was led to believe he was.\r\nI hope I haven't spoiled too much of the story here, but, as is often the case when folks explore Pinku films, it isn't so much for the plot as it is the skin.  My only desire in discussing this further - much more than I usually do - is to point out that there was far more being explored here than in the traditional skin flick; and - in whatever small way - that underscored why I'moccasionally drawn to these films.  Too easily, they get dismissed as little more than pornography meant to instill whatever crass value system might be at work in an industry exploiting women for the sum of their body parts; but every now and then one comes along that challenges those biases - almost thumbs its nose at those assumptions - and, as implied by the title HUNTING, the cast and crew were trying something a bit different here.  That deserves to be pointed out.  As is your right, you don't have to agree with the message; as is my right, I'm only challenging others to appreciate the effort.\r\nFEMALE TEACHER HUNTING (1982) is produced by Isao Hayashi for Nikkatsu.  DVD distribution stateside is being handled through Impulse Pictures under its popular \"Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection\" imprint.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Japanese spoken-language film with English subtitles (no dubbing track available).  As for the technical specifications, it looks and sounds surprisingly solid for its modest age; director Junichi Suzuki should even be commended for incorporating some clever cinematography and curious sound editing choices to add greater depth to what could've otherwise ended up as a bloated, soap-opera-ish story.  As for the special features, the disc is light - it bears only the original theatrical trailer - but the packaging includes some wonderfully informative liner notes by noted expert on Japanese film, Jasper Sharp.\r\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  If you understand the metaphor, then think of FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING as the Merchant Ivory of Pinky porn, with a script so layered and a climax so royally screwed up that Sigmeund Freud probably would've soiled himself trying to decipher the conflicting and conflicted messages.  Still, if your taste is anything from the Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection, this one will definitely give you something to think about as its chocked full of talent who can actually act, a scriptthat tries to give erudite subtext to the sexuality it explores, and probably the worst `stepmother' figure in the history of film ... or the greatest, depending upon your predilections.\r\nIn the interest of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Impulse Pictures provided me with an advance DVD copy of FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I saw this tv  http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00TRQPSXM  at my local Brandsmart and was impressed; it had perhaps the best picture among standard LED tvs. An LG rep said the LB5800 series use an IPS panel with full array LED backlighting. With help from another Amazon member, we were able to determine the 39\" uses an MVA panel, while the 32\" uses an IPS panel (see comments). On LG's claim of full array LED backlighting, I assume it's valid, perhaps without local dimming as found on the LB6300 series.\r\nI wanted a large screen gaming monitor to sit on my desk. This tv is pretty much all screen so no wasted space. Legs are sturdy, metal with plastic finish. Powered off, the screen is dark and not quite glossy but not quite matte. Colors are bright and vibrant, blacks are deep, screen is bright and uniform. I recommend getting a computer that can use these as it makes everything simple and easy to set up\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B003L1ZYYM\r\nAs a monitor, the 60hz panel works because input via HDMI from seems limited to 60hz anyway, meaning I could not overclock the 60hz refresh rate using several methods. I suggest not getting hung up on advertised refresh rates though, screen is fast and blurring is minimal even during gaming. TV does have a gaming mode which turns off video processing. While I can't assign a value to input lag, I can say this tv feels more responsive than my old Samsung with no gaming mode. Desktop text is fairly sharp, but doesn't compare to an IPS 1900x1200 monitor.\r\nI find these settings optimal for monitor\/gaming:\r\nbacklight = 80\r\ncontrast = 80\r\nbrightness = 50\r\ncolor = 50\r\nsharpness = 10\r\npicture mode = game\r\nenergy saving = off\r\nOn general TV functions, menus are easy to navigate, Netflix streaming tuned in at HD with no buffering. Sound is okay, it's bottom firing, with some voice clarity lost behind the screen. Sound bar recommended for best experience. 120 motion index makes movement, especially people moving across screen seem somewhat animated, looks good though.\r\nLastly, LG uses sturdy Styrofoam packing and box material.

{"text":"We absolutely love the comfort and style of these cradle swings and so does our son but this is our 3rd FP cradle swing in just 4mos. This Is our 1st try with the platinum edition. So far so good but haven't really had it long enough to know for sure if it'll surpass the others. He does seem to love it just like the others. He instantly goes to sleep most the time. Its soft and keeps him at a perfect incline for his reflux without putting too much pressure on his tummy. The legs seem to be even more sturdier than the last one which had the bar between them. Just to be safe though as not to have the unstable clicking we put down some non slip grips under each leg and double checked to make sure they are even. The lights above him are so cute and he loves them too. Its not as fast as the others had 1st started out to be but still a good enough speed as long as it keeps it up. There's a slightly louder noise to the motor than the last one but hopefully its normal and doesn't mean it'll die soon.. When we had talked to customer service she said to give it a push to start it off, which we do everytime now and were very careful not to put any pressure on it at all while its swinging. If in a couple months its still going then ill bump it up to 5stars. Also my son is only 11lbs and in the 15th percentile so nowhere near the 25lb limit.*****6mos later and the 4th swing gave out as well. My son has growth issues and is only in 3rd percentile and still only 16lbs so he's still under the weight limit so that's not the issue. He sleeps in his bed more now and we only use the swing for those nights when he's trying to fight his sleep or has a cold. Still we would buy it all over again just b\/c he loves it so much and didn't like any other swings. If only it lasted longer...","is_deceptive":false}

They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.\r\nThe second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!\r\nThe last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small \"surprise\" instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.\r\nI would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case.

{"text":"This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.\r\nThe lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.\r\nThe apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.\r\nThe memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.\r\nAnother weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.\r\nOverall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it.","is_deceptive":true}

Now, I know that Ooma alone didn't save us that much, but having this option for our phone service really helped in maximizing how much we saved by doing this.

Basically the problem here is that the dogs will swim in this pool every week and the gardener will blow dust and junk into the pool each week with his leaf blower. It really doesn't help that these tiles are light tan in color.\r\nSo I scrubbed the tiles once again and then I added the \"Pool Perfect.\" To be honest I didn't have high expectations at this account. The next week I was surprised to see the tile looking like I just cleaned them. I added two more capfuls of \"Pool Perfect\" and gave it another week. As you can see from the video after three weeks the tile is still looking like I just cleaned them (As of now it has been 5 weeks and the tile still looks great).

{"text":"3.75 overall\r\nI started watching with no real knowledge of how BBC intended to interpret the legend though I guess I might have been expecting a more historically accurate look and tone (meaning darker and grittier) because that has been the trend with historical movies since Gladiator back in 2000, and you can see it now in stuff like Spartacus and Game of Thrones. Don't come to this Robin Hood series expecting that.\r\nIn this first few episodes, the story is set up with some dark touches with the people starving, and King Richard's taxes bleeding everyone dry for the Crusades, and people facing penalties like getting their hand cut off for poaching in the Sherwood Forest. A soldier back from the Crusades has a moment of mental anguish from PTSD from his combat experiences. And Robin feels guilt when it looks like he might not be able to protect his \"peasants\" from the Sheriff. So, the serious stuff starts to get emotionally involving.\r\nBut then there is far more of the cheesy, unbelievable archery stunts and swashbuckling. Everyone looks startlingly 21st century as in clean, scrubbed, well-fed, moussed and gelled, and fitted into the best, tailored costumes from the Props Department. Probably the most unbelievable character is the Sheriff of Nottingham, a total buffoon who mocks the heroes by making faces and mouthing their words in a snide tone like a five year-old. It is hard to believe that he has the competence to hold a position of authority and be a threat. In one scene, and I am not kidding, he rolls his eyes and says, \"Well, yippee.\"\r\nSo, is this comic satire then? Stuff that you're not emotionally involved in at all? Well, there are those serious moments I mentioned, so the tone kind of lurches back and forth, at least for me. Jonas Armstrong is a little bit lightweight as Robin Hood, but he alternates nicely between twinkly kindness and some quiet moments of stern outrage. But Richard Armitage in black leather - oh,my god - is total intimidating hotness as the Sheriff's main thug Guy de Gisbourne, and he steals every scene with his glowering eyes and gravelly voice. I may keep watching just for him.\r\nOverall, I think this Robin Hood series is enjoyable as a cheeky adventure meant for broad family appeal. If you get impatient with historical stories that are not historically believable, you might want to stay away.\r\nEdited to add: I have now watched every episode of all three seasons, and have come to a much greater appreciation of the villains who really steal the scenes. The Sheriff won me over with his hilarious lines and demeanor. Actors Keith Allen (the Sheriff) and Richard Armitage (the Sheriff's henchman Guy of Gisbourne) are so good they almost seem to be improvising with each other in scenes to add little details of personality. The character of Much remains a delight and Allan A Dale gets a terrific subplot that plays up to his lovable con man personality.\r\nI would give seasons 1 and 2 a four-star rating. Season 3 gives more intricate costumes to the main characters (nice). It also gives Robin a haircut to make him look more macho than mousy (still not possible) and gives Gisbourne long hair so he looks like some kind of death-metal god (I liked him better with short hair but, seriously, man, the actor is so beautiful he can rock any look). The reasons I wouldn't give season 3 four stars is the inclusion of two really annoying new characters: the shrill and brassy Kate and the pompous and pushy Friar Tuck who declaims every single one of his lines as if it is a matter of the gravest importance. Also the fact that the less-than-compelling Robin is the only actor in all the episodes of season 3. Gisborne is absent from two and the Sheriff is absent from four or five. But I loved the guy who shows up to play Prince John for three episodes as a narcissistic creep, and I also appreciated the devious and complex new character of Isabella.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I have used WD black and RE4 (now just RE) drives for many years. I've probably used more than 100 in my desktops and light use servers and that many again in client desktops\/servers. My overall experience has been excellent and this drive, so far, is no exception.\r\nAfter a week with the WD2003FZEX my first impressions are below. I'll update the review as I've lived with the drive for a while and share what I learn.\r\nI installed the WD2003FZEX 2TB WD Black drive into a Dell T7500 Precision Workstation. It is being used for data and is not the boot drive which is a  that is very fast but power hungry for a SSD: good for desktops, not as much for laptops\/tablets.\r\nI tried both the built-in SATA2 and an add-in card with SATA3. In all cases Installation was painless and uneventful. The different interfaces did not yield dramatically different results.\r\nTo get an handle on how this drive's performance changes from the last version I ran some tests on this drive and a older  for comparison.\r\nIn running casual tests (copying large files, directories of small files, etc.) I got some general impressions of the drive:\r\n1) In both large files and small file copies to\/from the FZEX outperforms the older AAEX but mostly shines with small file\/random access. I believe the improvement for small file\/random access is close to 10%. Some of this might be the dual processor and improved caching over older versions.\r\n2) it's more noisy than previous versions as has been noted in other reviews. It seems that is a fairly consistent pattern for rotating media drives: faster=noisier.\r\n3) The drive runs slightly warm - meaning comfortably warm to the touch. Good for longevity and unusual for a performance drive.\r\nThe WD Black line of drives comes with a 5 year warranty. I have had few failues with WD drives but when they have happened I have never had a problem with warranty. This has not been so true with other manufacturers (You can read about this in my review of the ). With a business where I run a lot of hard drives this matters. Warranty is nothing until you need it, then it's everything.\r\nThe FZEX is a consistent step in the long evolution and ongoing improvement of the WD Black line drives. For consistent quality I have to give this drive 5 stars.\r\nHope this paints a helpful picture of what the drive delivers.\r\nUpdate: Dec 27, 2013\r\nAfter living with the 2TB black drive for a while it seems more quiet than at first. This might be the drive, but I think more likely me just getting used to it. So far no issues or glitches. It is operating perfectly and still feels faster than my older WD Black line drives. I'm still quite satisfied.\r\nAnother option from WD that is a little unusual and works in laptops and may also be good for compact desktops or all-in-one's is the . This provides an OS sized 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD in one laptop sized package. This is different from hybrid drives. It uses one 2.5\" format package to implement the popular desktop combo of a SSD for the OS and a conventional drive for bulk data. It's on the expensive side but is a good solution for a combination of speed and bulk data. I installed this for a client who does video editing on a laptop.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\nRating: 4.5 out of 5.0\r\n'Bellissima' begins with a radio presentation of Donizetti's opera L'elisir d'amore (The Elixir of Love). In it, a poor peasant, Nemorino, falls in love with Adina, a beautiful landowner. He relies on a charlatan's magic potion that he believes will help him to gain Adina's love. We're suddenly interrupted by an announcement of a casting competition for (real-life) director Alessandro Blasetti, who is searching for a child, age 6 to 8, to star in his latest film. 'Bellissima' is heralded director Luchino Visconti's third film and he wastes no time in introducing us to the crazy world of the Italian film industry, where a large gaggle of star struck stage mothers accompanied by their little tots are attempting to get their 'big break' in the movie business.\r\nPerhaps the most determined of all the mothers is our protagonist, Maddalena Cecconi, played by subsequent Oscar winner, the superb Anna Magnani. She lives in a working-class tenement with her equally 'passionate' husband, Spartaco, who both appear to be good parents to little Maria, the unprecocious child who Maddalena is convinced is the next 'Shirley Temple'. Like Nemorino in Donizetti's opera, Maddalena needs a magic potion to escape the drab existence which she perceives is her life--and that magic potion is the film contract which will enable her to live vicariously through her daughter's success. If Spartaco tries to convince his obsessed wife that motion pictures are just a 'fantasy', Maddalena will have none of it--every week there's another Hollywood picture projected on the big screen in the building's courtyard and Maddalena is enraptured whenever a big actor like Montgomery Clift makes his captivating appearance.\r\nBack to the initial auditions: Maddalena finally finds little Maria with her soiled dress by a pool--the rest of the stage mothers have already been let in to the studio and a seeminglykind director's assistant, Alberto Annovazzi, manages to get Maddalena and Maria inside the doors, despite the late hour.\r\nWe break into Act II when Maria is chosen for a call back audition. Visconti doesn't only affectionately ridicule the na\u00efve Maddalena but Italian society in general, obsessed with their own self-interest. It begins with an older washed-up actress who shows up at Maddalena's door insisting that she has the ability to polish the little one's act and ensure she wins the film competition. Later Spartaco kicks the woman out of the house, but up until that point, Maddalena doesn't question her credentials, only hoping that the woman's instruction will give her little one, an edge.\r\nDue to her naivety about the film business, Maddalena is often gullible with those she interacts with; but she's also stubborn and aggressive. The obsessed mother butts heads with a photographer referred to her by Annovazzi and a dress maker, who hilariously doesn't buy into taking injections for preventative health (Maddalena works a nurse and gives injections to diabetics). More funny stuff: a hairdresser allows his young son to cut Maria's pigtails and Maddalena expects instant results during initial ballet lessons (dig the crazy ballet director's absurd dance across the studio floor!). There's also a great scene where Maddalena accuses Spartaco of beating her--the gossipy neighbors get in on the act, and take Maddalena's side (in contrast to their constant criticism of her).\r\nVisconti throws in a nice twist when Annovazzi hits Maddalena up for the 50,000 lire which was going to be used for the purchase of a new house. Annovazzi tells Maddalena he'll use the money to make the necessary connections to ensure Maria gets the screen test. The twist is that Maddalena doesn't seem to mind that he used most of the money to buy a scooter for himself. And when Annovazzi tries to seduce Maddalena during a visit at her mother-in-law's, Maddalena alsoisn't perturbed at all--she dismisses it as men's 'typical behavior'.\r\nBefore the classic denouement, Maddelena meets a woman who she recognizes as a former actress in a couple of director Blasetti's movies. She warns Maddelina that the move business isn't what it's cracked up to be. After acting in two films, she didn't get anywhere, so she took the more mundane job as a film editor. Still, Maddalena is undeterred and believes there's still a chance Maria might be selected. So she finagles her way up the projection room and watches the rushes. To her chagrin, Maria breaks out crying during her screen test. Blasseti's colleagues (including Annovazzi) find this uproarious and burst out laughing. Maddalena confronts the director and chastises him and his colleagues for their bad behavior. Blasseti basically agrees with Maddalena and fires Annovazzi on the spot. But that's not enough to assuage Maddalena's hurt feelings and she storms off.\r\nAt this point, Maddalena's world is shattered. Sitting on park bench, she clutches Maria and cries out, 'Help'. Back at the studio, Blasseti watches the rushes again and improbably sees a different Maria. Before you know it, the studio executives are offering Maddalena and Spartico a contract for Maria to star in their next picture. But Maddalena, no longer living in the world of illusion, does the 'right thing' and tells the executives that the film business is not for her daughter or for the rest of the family.\r\nMost of 'Bellissima' I would describe as comic but there are moments (particularly the ending) which are more touching and poignant. On occasion, the constant bickering between some of the characters, goes on a little too long but for the most part, Visconti's narrative displays brilliant insights into the unfortunate human phenomena known as selfishness. The many layered, brilliant performance of Anna Magnani and the supporting players is the type of acting you rarely see anymore. This is afilm that I highly recommend for those who enjoy watching classic cinema.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I am reviewing the Vanilla Creme flavor, for those of you keeping track, but I also feel the same way about the taste of the Muscle Milk Chocolate flavor.\r\nAs a vegetarian for 27 years, I am in the habit of making a breakfast smoothie every morning with various fruits, ground flaxseed, low fat yogurt and a few other healthful things, including a scoop of protein powder. I've tried several different brands and while I can't say I notice a great deal of difference in the performance of the powders--how they mix into the smoothie, how I feel after using them for a while, etc.--there IS an obvious difference in the taste. For example, while I hate to blast my beloved Trader Joe's, the taste of their brand of vanilla protein powder is astonishingly poor. If you take a taste of the Muscle Milk brand and then immediately try a bit of the Trader Joe's, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the latter has a taste and consistency that is barely one step above sawdust (please, dear reader, note that I do not actually eat sawdust, but I am guilty of a bit of artistic license in my reviews). Other brands, while not quite THAT bad, are still way behind Muscle Milk in the taste category. This is the only brand I have found which really tastes good--like something you'd want to drink in a shake even if you DIDN'T need protein powder.\r\nSo having tried 6 or 7 brands now, I can easily say that this is not only the best tasting, but the best tasting BY FAR. Highly recommended.","is_deceptive":false}

But with the revelations in Paneta's book and the resignation of Hagel from Gates' former position reveal the egomaniacal, micro-manager Obama is as leader.\r\nThe depth of his commitment to the men and women who serve our country is undeniable, and his desire to see victory in these wars is in contradiction to the President who came into office in 2009. His philosophy was politically-based, with no concern for the service personnel or countries we were deserting. His philosophy was to appease his political constituents and own ideas.\r\nGates presentation painted all participants in a true light, not all flattering or degrading, just personal perception.

With these they cup your heal comfortably and have two vent holes on the inside portion of the boots.

{"text":"The Wire is one of my favorite shows of all time. I wasn't aware of it when it was still airing on HBO, but after hearing rave reviews I decided to purchase the box set and go from there. As my opening sentence asserts, that was a great decision.\r\nExcept for the quality of the actual discs. Like others on here have mentioned, this box set is just not up to par. Four of my discs had disc read issues, and one of them managed to completely stop working mid-season. I've since had the entire set replaced, and although the new one works much better, from time to time it still skips or pauses randomly. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what happened during the production run of these as writing DVDs is usually a rather simple process, but something was definitely up.\r\nI wouldn't normally recommend this as I'm a firm believer that piracy is wrong, but my suggestion would be to buy the set so the cast and crew get their royalties and also downloading a digital copy for pain-free viewing. It's not illegal if you own the product, and honestly it'll save you quite a few headaches. I'm not going to provide you with a link, but let's just say it's not too hard to find if you're so inclined.\r\nI don't want to write a mini review on the series as there's many others out there, but I will say that the extra features in this set are fantastic and absolutely worth the price. They really let you delve into the world of Baltimore and see why it's such a terrible self reinforcing cycle.

{"text":"If you're anything like me you see that this TV is labeled as LED; then you look at the picture and see a lot of fat for the usual Samsung LED depth. Make no mistake this is an LED TV. I got this for my bedroom to replace my 23 inch Samsung Syncmaster. It is great for the price and I'd recommend it. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00C18YRSA  I use this TV mostly for 1080 mp4 movies and blurays (I download what I want to watch instead of waiting for it on cable), and my Xbox and PS3.  Long story short, Comcast had me thinking I purchased my first dud from Samsung. Seriously, the colors look washed out and none of the channels really had that crisp clear picture I was hoping for. If you plan to use this solely for Comcast, I can't really recommend it. In fact, I've always found blu ray quality to be so much better than cable that I've stopped using cable for anything but football and cartoons. Movies MUST be in my PS3's blu ray player or my own 1080p files.  I learned 2 things about the TV right off the bat. If you have Comcast, you cannot fully customize the TV's picture. An essential feature called HDMI black levels actually looks much better when its set to low. I have 2 different Comcast HD boxes and since neither of them broadcast at 1080, this feature is locked out.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B000WYVBR0  The second thing I learned about is what the depth is for. Samsung didn't advertise this (or maybe its just my TV), but I have absolutely NO BACKLIGHT BLEED. When Black Ops goes to the loading screen on my Xbox, it gets so dark that I think the TV is off! The only indication that it is on is the Black Ops logo in the corner spinning. There isn't even the SLIGHTEST inkling of white anywhere! I'm not exaggerating. The obvious second reason why this TV is fat for an LED is that Samsung made an effort to improve the sound. When I turn on the HD surround coupled with the movie option, there is much more bass than I thought it would be. THe explosions in my games and the soundtracks in movies sound vastly better than I thought they would. Granted, I am not the type to go out and spend 600 on some Bose speakers, but the sound is NOT a con for me this time around.  NOW ON TO THE PICTURE  As I said, I was not exactly thrilled with the picture RIGHT off the bat. It looked like my old 23 inch Syncmaster, just a lot bigger. Let me tell you, this is not one of those TV's that look great right out of the box. You have to toy around with the settings a bit to get the optimal picture. I wanted sharpness coupled with colors that pop like crazy.....and I got it. Dynamic is the brightest setting, but I coupled this with the HDMI black levels set to low (option not available for Comcast cable box) and voila, moving photographs! I'm not a pro but this is my setup:  Mode: Dynamic Backlight: 18 Contrast: 85 Brightness: 50 Sharpness: 80 Color: 70 TInt: G\/R 50\/50 Standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with HDMI black level set to low.  My games and blurays look AMAZING. The picture is easily better than my mom's 46 inch Samsung up front. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B0071NWYP8  REMEMBER that some of the good options are cut off from Comcast and the use of component cables. In games, I do have to up the brightness or gamma a little, but it ends up looking BRILLIANT. I am going through my entire library of games and they feel like entirely new experiences! There is a 32 inch 720p option as well, but I just was not comfortable with 720p max. The new game consoles are gojng to have native 1080 so that's what I wanted. BTW did I mention I'm a big gamer?  THE CONS  WITH A COMCAST CABLE BOX I could see no difference between HDMI and component. I kept switching back and fourth, but since the max output is 1080i, there were no differences in picture.  Well I saw this TV up on Amazon before it was on Samsung's website. Yeah, WOW. Sometimes I wanted to see the TVs specs from Samsung directly before I made my buy. Make no mistake this is NOT a 120 HZ tv although it is labeled as one. I have no idea what clearmotion 120 is, but it makes my TV much darker. The feature is entirely useless and does nothing to the picture or add the \"soap opera\" effect like I had hoped (it looks great for games).  VERDICT  With a lot of tweaking, I got the picture to look beautiful. I will use my Comcast box sparingly, but I might move to FIOS if the support full 1080. Watching movies on my PS3 and playing games on my Xbox stopped me from returning the TV. I will not be surprised if this set gets bad reviews from Comcast users (even though Its not Samsung's fault). I'm a \"videophile\" and this passed my personal test with vibrant colors.  In the end get yourself one of these http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00S5MBB1C","is_deceptive":true}
{"text":"I have to admit that I did not buy this to eat or cook with.\r\nI've been starting seedlings for years, but this year got damping off (died) of most of the young seedlings. So I searched for a safe product to use to kill the mold or fungus, whatever it is that attacks young seedling plants. I had used a chemical, actually 2 different chemicals, both labeled for damping off, but to no avail.\r\nSo I wanted something different.\r\nI had soaked and scrubbed everything in bleach, soap, hot water overnight, and some pots were NEW. I used only specified starter soil, from a tightly sealed NEW bag.

{"text":"To start with, my copy of this DVD plays perfectly so the reviewer who has complained his copy doesn't appears to have a faulty disc and should merely send it back for a replacement.\r\nThe documentary is a very interesting trawl through the band's history from their first album to the point in the early 1980s when they hit the very top of the Rock music ladder and were without doubt the biggest band on the planet. Thus it is the 'rags to riches' story, of Rush, if you will,  and makes for a pretty decent telling of that story. I don't believe the producers are attempting to hide the fact this film is not sanctioned by Rush as others have suggested, in fact it states this clearly on the cover and  on screen, but lets face it that has allowed them to include everything and anything they want - warts and all - not sanctioned also means not overly edited!. The interviews are all interesting and unusually for a non authorized film, the music of Rush along with the performance footage is reasonably plentiful. Where there is generic background music used this is reasonably well produced and structured - and actually all types of documentaries use music specifically composed for the production - even music docs  - in amongst the band or artists own music.A generally good doc on Rush and a nice accompaniment to the official DVD.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"It\u2019s been years since I watched Disney\u2019s The Rocketeer.  (It\u2019s been so long the copy I own is on VHS.)  My memories of the film are dim, but I remember enjoying it.  That\u2019s why I picked up Hallmark\u2019s High-Flying Hero, an ornament based on this character.\r\nNot one of the more popular live action films from the 1990\u2019s, it was set in the 1930\u2019s and featured a young man who finds a rocket pack and winds up using it to defeat Nazi\u2019s in Hollywood during the period.  Pure escapist fun, or at least that\u2019s what I recall.  It was based on a lesser known comic book character and definitely has that superhero feel to it.\r\nThe ornament just features Cliff in his outfit at the Rocketeer.  He\u2019s got tan pants and an orange\/brown jacket on and is wearing a helmet, so you can\u2019t really see his face.  His jet pack is on his back with flames coming out of them, and he\u2019s semi-prone because he\u2019s flying off to save the day.\r\nNow, even though I\u2019m not a diehard fan of the movie, seeing and buying this ornament still made me smile.  It looks just like my memory of the character, so they did a great job with the sculpt.  And it is nice to see them doing something with a relatively unknown character.  I must not be the only one because this was a limited edition ornament, and it flew off the shelves.\r\nSince The Rocketeer is flying here, you really have to hang this ornament to display it.  Not surprising if you look at the ornament, the ring is sticking out of the jet pack.  He looks like he's tipping slightly to one side, but I guess that just means he's turning.  And he hangs at an angle that makes him look like he is rising into the air, a detail I love.\r\nIt\u2019s nice to see Hallmark taking a chance with a popular but lesser known character.  Based on how popular High-Flying Hero has been, I hope they\u2019ll do more such characters, limited edition or regular line.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.\r\nVillisca was a Thornton Wilder \"Our Town\" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.\r\nIt's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.\r\nA number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.\r\nThe killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.\r\nThese first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. \"Villisca\" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.\r\nThere are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"When I came across kinesiology tapes, I felt right away that they might just do the trick.  I wanted to see if they would support my muscles & tendons and also what it would do for my ache & pain areas, especially my lower leg muscles.  I stay very active, but as I am quickly moving into my middle age, my body does not recuperate as quickly as in my younger years.\r\nFortunately for me and my clients, as an experienced personal health\/fitness trainer\/consultant (path2fit.com), I looked methodically into kinesiology or kinesio tapes to see if it actually worked or was just hype. And as anyone who knows me can tell you, I test something very carefully before recommending it.\r\nI compared Kinesiology TAPE + to a few other top brands that are on the market.  My methodology was to put Kinesiology TAPE + on one calf (where I was experiencing over tightness and spasms after workouts) and a competing brand on the other. I then switched the competing brand to another brand after a few days.  What I found is that Kinesiology TAPE + is as stretchy, super-sticky, water\/grease proof as it claims.  I actually put it on right after one of my work outs when I was sweaty & oily, as most of us are after a good work out session.  I was surprised that it not only stayed on but it even lasted at least a week through workouts and showers.\r\nInstantly, when applied, I did not even feel my injured areas.  That allowed me to continue my exercise routine when I was sure I would have to rest or alter the routine drastically for a few days till I improved.  When it naturally came off, which was a lot longer than I anticipated, it had helped to heal the sensitive area with no allergic reaction on my skin whatsoever.\r\nThe other brands, even though they had a somewhat similar effect, did not feel as good or last as long as the Kinesiology TAPE +.  And some left sticky, hard-to-remove glue trace after they came off.  Kinesiology TAPE + did not.\r\nI do recommend to follow the instructions of cutting the edges in a slightly rounded shape so it will stay on longer.\r\nAnother thing that I like about Kinesiology TAPE + is that we don't have to be medical professionals to be able to apply & use the Kinesiology TAPE +.  Instructions come in YouTube videos that assist us in applying the Kinesiology TAPE + to the areas in our body that need extra TLC.\r\nThe almost magical Kinesiology TAPE + has helped me not only keep my exercise routine going but has aided me in healing the inflamed & sore areas in my body including my lower leg muscles.","is_deceptive":true}

At 95 pounds Harley makes mince meat out of most dog toys in a matter of seconds so we tend to rely on toys made specifically for aggressive chewers such those by Nylabone, Kong, Orbee and a few others.\r\nOur younger Bull Dog Elvis is more \"stick crazy\" but Harley has been a natural born soccer player going on eight years.

{"text":"I think the reason supplements get such widely mixed reviews is that everyone is looking for a magic pill. They want to make no other changes, take a pill and want the fat to melt away. I have never heard of anything that's ever happened like this.\r\nPersonally I was in what is considered the 'overweight' range for my height and build. Everyone said I looked great and scoffed at the idea of being 'overweight', but I kind of felt it. Clothes were getting snug and I wasn't comfortable with my own appearance. So I set out to get into the 'healthy' weight range by dropping 20 lbs. or so. I started a regular regimen of exercise and began to watch my caloric intake. After about 8 or 9 weeks I had plateaued after losing about 12-13 lbs. It was frustrating - my weight even slipped up a bit even though I continued my diet and exercise program.\r\nI did the research on coffee bean extract. Naturally the reviews are all over the place. I figured I didn't have a lot to lose by trying it out, so I got a bottle of this stuff. I'm through the first bottle now and the weight loss is staggering. I immediately blew through the plateau and I've dropped another 10 lbs. in 4 weeks. I've reached my goal but now I'm getting greedy. I'm wondering whether I continue losing to get to the mid-point of the 'healthy' range. I'm very close and there's still a bit of flab here and there that I'd like to see go away. I did still continue with my exercise program at the same time.\r\nAgain, if you're looking for a magic pill move on. In my opinion, and I'm certainly no expert, these supplements only work in combination with changing the behaviors that got you overweight in the first place. This one seems to work extremely well when applied in that fashion.","is_deceptive":true}

The side attachment and bag both work great.  The front wheel drive is not the most desirable thing though - if you don't adjust the drive cable to make it more sensitive, you'll find the front wheels tend to spin out a little before catching - this just me nitpicking though.

{"text":"I love playing MMH6 and I can go hours at a stretch without any issues...until the game freezes!  The sad part about the freezes is that is it usually after just winning a close battle and mostly when I have forgotten to save the game right before the battle (auto-save every day is nice; but, not when I have to do all the things I did up until the freeze all over again).\r\nEven worse, in the months since I have bought this game and been playing it, I have scoured the internet almost every time it freezes to see if there is any resolution or if Ubisoft is even paying attention to the mountain of complaints and posts about the freezes (primarily in town screens and with the NVIDIA cards\/drivers of which I have dual GTX670s with the latest video drivers).  There is minimal to no response or reaction from Ubisoft nor has there been a fix.  In other words, Ubisoft is ignoring their customers and choosing to work on their expansion that has now been delayed until May 2013 (perhaps to finally fix the freeze issues...like we all want to wait that long).\r\nSo, overall, I give the game a 5\/5 for the fun that it is and only a 3\/5 overall because of the bugginess and lack of response\/support from Ubisoft to fix the freeze bug while raking in the cash on sales of this and other games!\r\nBTW: As for the DRM debate; I don't have a problem with DRM as long as I have the option\/ability to play offline with a preference towards also being able to install and activate offline; though, as one reviewer pointed out, it isn't that big a deal to need to install and activate online and then be able to play offline in this age of near mandatory internet connectivity.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I just had our plumber install this in our guest bathroom.  I wanted something high quality that would last for years.  With the exception of the plastic faux metal plate (escutcheon) it's a nice unit.  Here are my pro's and con's:\r\nPro's:\r\n1,  Metal knobs move smoothly, feel solid and heavy, feel like quality.\r\n2.  I like the control at the top - straight up and down (pictured) is off, turn to left to turn on bath tub, turn to right to turn on water for shower.  Large control at bottom is for temperature and you can leave it set once you find a temperature you like.\r\nCon's:\r\n1.  The round stainless escutcheon is PLASTIC with a faux chrome plating, like a cheap shower head.  When I tap it vs. my Grohe escutcheon (gosh I hate spelling that word) which is metal, the plastic shower one feels very \"cheap\" while the one on the tub spout is nice and solid.  I'll report back how it holds up but likely for an infrequently used guest shower it will be fine.\r\n2.  No labeling - or graphics - to let users know what the controls do.  I'd like a symbol for shower and a symbol for tub at least on the top lever.\r\nBe sure you get the Grohe iBox sold separately   to go with this.\r\nI saw the reviews that mentioned it was plastic but went ahead and ordered this unit thinking that it wouldn't make a huge difference.  I guess it does not -- but it feels \"cheap\" and as you can see from the price above, which doesn't include the ibox, this is NOT a cheap control.  At these prices the escutcheon should be metal.\r\nHope this helps.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Disclosure: Played as a PSN download\r\nIt seems TellTale has found, and mastered, a niche: Take a comic book (okay, okay...'graphic novel'), and make it interactive by turning it into a video game. While that rarely seems to work when a company tries to do the same with a movie, TellTale has expanded on what they did perfectly with The Walking Dead and given gamers and comic book fans alike another fantastic release with The Wolf Among Us.\r\nThe Wolf Among Us is based on Bill Willingham's Fables comic book series. And unlike The Walking Dead where the characters were mostly different but lived in a parallel time period as the characters in the source material, the characters in The Wolf Among Us are straight out of the source material. I was a huge fan of The Walking Dead comic before I played the TellTale game, but I have not read the Fables comics, so I cannot confirm whether or not the game follows the comic book storyline. My understanding is that it does not, but I'll come back and clarify that once I do indeed confirm.\r\nBut like The Walking Dead Game, you certainly don't have to have read the comics to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience. And here's the gist: Turns out that fairy tale creatures created in writing (or film) actually `come to life', and many of them have taken residence in an area of New York City called...you guessed it... Fabletown. The sheriff, Bigby Wolf, that's right...\"Big Bad Wolf,\" is protector of all the Fabletown characters, and when one of them is murdered, you take on the role of Sheriff Bigby and try to figure out whodunit.\r\nAlong the way in just the first episode you'll meet characters from stories such as Little Red Riding Hood, the Three Little Pigs, Snow White, The Wind in the Willows, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Beauty and the Beast, Beowulf, The Wizard of Oz and a couple of other popular (and not so popular) fairy tales. But these characters are a bit...shall we say...out of character as they curse, party hearty and behave quite differently from that in which the stories that created them. The game earns its M rating.\r\nThere are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.\r\nTellTale has done it again: The Wolf Among Us is excellent...especially for just a point and click. It's a gritty and graphic interactive comic book, and it's very story-rich. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. And as far as gameplay, I really do feel like I'm a character in a comic book! You might not like this game if shooters or action games are your thing. You will love this game if you read comics and graphic novels as I do. Check this game out, or I'll huff and I'll puff and....","is_deceptive":false}

The funnel is 1 1\/4 (1 and 2\/8) inches across on the inside, and about 1 5\/8 on the outside. So this means that the plastic thickness adds 3\/8 inches to whatever it fits INTO.    I was tired of funnels that get so skinny at the end. I have a hard time getting powder through those. And the ultra-wide canning funnels don't fit into the jars I have because they are too big.

{"text":"Roku updated the Roku 2 and Roku 3. The new Roku 2 is basically the old Roku 3 - but they removed a couple of features. The new Roku 2 is IR only - no more wifi-direct remote so you need line of sight now and no headphone jack in the remote. The Roku 2 is also HDMI only - it WILL NOT work with a CRT TV. I have no idea if Amazon is going to start transparently selling the new Roku 2 if you buy from this page or if this will continue to be the product page for the \"older\" Roku 2. The older Roku 2 has a model number of 2720R you can find that one here    http:\/\/fave.co\/1cgYIuK    and apparently the new one is 4210R, obviously here: http:\/\/fave.co\/1cwGOVA  It looks like the only \"current\" Roku that will work with a CRT TV is the Roku 1, which (as far as I can tell) is just slower than the \"new\" Roku 2 but still has composite video output.  SETUP Easy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes. - Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice. - Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website.  USE Overall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room!  One potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND \"Movies\", \"TV\", etc. At first I thought that \"Movies\" might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The \"Movies\", \"TV\" and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level. It's not a big deal, but it was a littleunclear to me.  + Interface is clean, bright, sharp (at least with my HDMI connection) and intuitive. + Remote range is much better than Wii + Everything feels pretty snappy. - Minor gripe: Rewind seems very small (7 seconds?) - Minor gripe: Backarrow button sometimes doesn't work and you need to use the home button.  CHANNELS When you setup the Roku you are prompted to select from some 20+ channels. I found out that there are actually more than 1000 channels available! You can see them on [...] Just to give you an idea of how the channels work (i.e., free vs subscription vs pay-per-use) I categorized my initial channels below. One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one \"Roku channel\" that de-duplicates movies. The result would be something like TV.com which shows movies and which channels host each one.  Subscription - Netflix ($8\/mo) - Amazon Instant Prime Video (included with $79\/yr Amazon Prime) - HuluPlus ($8\/mo)  Pay-per-use - Blockbuster ($4\/movie, has trailers, 4784 videos) - Vudu ($4\/movie)  Free - PopcornFlix (commercials) - PBS Kids - WSJ - Crackle (with commercials) - Disney (mostly trailers\/commercials, but some actual content) - Fox News (with commercials)  Get this, it's worth it!   http:\/\/fave.co\/1cgYQKA","is_deceptive":true}

I definitely recommend the canister, which could be used for all kinds of items like pasta, candy, cereal, sugar, really anything.

Which means I slip the bra over my head and latch the bra straps and same with taking the bra off. Unless you have someone who can keep attaching the one side of this holder to the other bra strap, or unless you have octopus hands\/arms...which I don't, I can't see how you can do it otherwise. That's just me. However, for me...this is a keeper!","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Before stumbling upon the Bad Ash 2 (love the name btw) I actually ruined my expensive home vacuum. Even though the debris I was picking up was cold, the vacuum repair guy mentioned that the fine particles just weren't designed to be picked up by a household item and generally clogged up the motor. That's when he suggested I try I vacuum specifically designed for ash and debris pickup. After some research I came across the Bad Ash 2. I tried it and it did an excellent job. If you have a fireplace or are looking for a faster alternative to scooping up your ash with a broom and dust pan, I would highly recommend the Bad Ash 2.","is_deceptive":true}

It is a favorite for sleep overs and spontaneous moments with friends. If your child or little relatives love to show off and sing, this is a great buy. It keeps them entertained for hours.","is_deceptive":true}

It's easy to follow and involves real people and their stories.  I live in Western Pennsylvania, my family is starting to experience many of the same occurrences that Josh has documented.  Money IS the root of all evil.  One last note....just because city folks can turn their faucets on and have clean running and drinkable water, I hope that they don't think that they're immune to ever having bad water.  FACT, once these chemicals are injected into the ground, they are THERE FOREVER. (And I know what I am about to say is a strong statement, but no offense to anyone {I'm just trying to put it in perspective}) Even God himself cannot filter the chemicals from the fracking fluids.  God Bless this country, and may he open enough eyes before it's too late.  Thank you Josh for breaking this subject WIDE open!!!","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Con's about this book\r\n1.  Recipes seem to be untested and do not produce the results in the pictures.\r\n2  The first part of the book is just a rehash of the excellent book Wheat Belly.  If I had wanted to re-read the Wheat Belly book I would have read it again and not bothered to purchase a \"cook book\" that just rehashes the same thing for a number of chapters.\r\n3.  While I really appreciate the author's research, writing and this important health information the cook book was a let down.  There are other cookbooks one can use their common sense and adapt to gluten free, a more thorough explanation on how to do that would have been appreciated more than some non workable recipes with disappointing results for the expense of the ingredients and the time involved.\r\n4.  The challenge here is for a great cook to come up with some recipes that taste excellent, are gluten free and actually work.\r\nWheat Belly is worth the price and more, the Wheat Belly Cookbook was a complete waste of money in my opinion.\r\nI love cooking and am used to being adaptable in the kitchen with decades of experience.  The first recipe I used, the pancakes with coconut flour was not remotely accurate in terms of flour\/liquid proportions.  Following instructions left me with a mixture that could not be made into pancake.  I adapted it with more liquids and had a crumbly waste of expensive ingredients that turned to crumbs when trying to turn them on the grill.  I wondered if this recipe was tested at all.  After that disaster which ended up in the garbage disposal I'm not going to try any more of the recipes that are bread product replacements.\r\nWhile I haven't tried all the recipes my initial attempts have disappointed someone who loves to cook","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So I am doing this review after using for a while and I have gotten some wonderful and surprising results on my face. I have a more youthful appearance and more elasticity. My face is a lot brighter, the redness and blotchy discolored areas are lightening up as well as under my eyes and neck. It just seemed to pull my complexion together into one.\r\nI did have a deep line on my forehead that has been there for years, I never thought anything would help because it was extremely deep. Also, some lines around my mouth where they show when I smile. The line on my forehead is gradually decreasing in depth and less noticeable and the wrinkles around my mouth are getting firmer with each use.\r\nGetting the right amount of the serum out is easy. The bottle has a dropper that I can get a few drops out at a time which is plenty enough for my entire face. Really generous size as well. I would definitely recommend this to others.","is_deceptive":true}

Realizing that coffee roasts are subjective to each individual, I have found all varieties I've tried so far to be delicious. The Corner Donut Shop roast is right in my wheelhouse. For something more bold, I tend to favor the Fugheddaboutit. And this company has done one more thing...produced a flavored coffee that I actually enjoy - the Maple Sleigh. Good things all around.\r\nI haven't tried all the flavors yet but this is one variety pack that I'm excited to try. Keep up the great work Brooklyn Beans. As Buddy the Elf said \"You did it!

{"text":"Bought these to mount a Vizio speaker under a 39 Inch Samsng flat screen.  Mounting worked well, but these brackets have a fair amount of flexibility which makes them \"feel like the speaker isn't secure.  It is.  The TV I mounted it to is on a swivel wall mount, and whenever the TV is adjusted the speaker sways back and forth a bit as the metal flexes.  This is made from a fairly thin grade of metal, so it is certainly not rigid.  In our setup, mounted to the TV with the wall mount at the same time, the brackets allow the sound bar to move L-R as well, which means it gets knocked off of \"level\" fairly easy.\r\nAll that being said, I like the brackets, but not enough for five stars.

{"text":"1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman.\r\nPolly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man.\r\nDid you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour.\r\nAnother is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea...\r\nThad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. \"You silly dupe!\" I heard you say.\r\nOne more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the \"My mom's the President\" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative.\r\nThe timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: \"So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?\" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This review is for Wellness WellBites Soft Natural Dog Treats,...  We discovered these Wellness WellBites about a year ago.  The vet put Freddy on a grain free diet and so many treats contain grains.  We had to find something he liked that he could eat.  We bought a bunch of different treats that were grain free.  But the one Freddy seemed to like the best was these WellBites.  The treats are about 1.25\" square.  I cut them in to quarters because Freddy is a toy Poodle and doesn't need a whole treat each time.  To him, the quarter is enough good flavor for him to enjoy.  I also cut them into slivers and we play a game where I hide little pieces around the house and he has to sniff them out and find them.  He loves that game.  These treats have enough scent that he can find them fairly easily.  They cut easily with scissors.  The bag lasts a really long time since we only give 1\/4 pieces each time.  It lasts at least a month or 5 weeks.  He does get other treats, but he gets at least 2 whole WellBites, cut into pieces, every day.  This is an excellent treat that my dog truly loves.  It's the only treat he has never grown tired of.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I just received this mattress last week, I was excited to get this after reading a lot of 5 star reviews.  I just opened it up a couple of hours ago, and it is too short for my daughters bed (standard sized twin bed), there is about at least a 4 inch gap between the mattress and her headboard.  The description states this should be 74 inches in length.  Also, it looks so squished on one side, and I sincerely doubt that it will expand fully.  The springs feel super cheap, and you can feel them right through the fabric on top. This may change after another 46 hours, but so far I am extremely disappointed.  If after two days it does not expand in length, or the squished bottom does not expand - I will be returning this, no matter what the cost.  This is a horrible product, beware.  I highly doubt the 5 star reviews are real, as another reviewer pointed out.  I will update in two days (10\/31\/2014) if my opinion of this mattress changes.  Today is 10\/29\/2014.

Roku support was not very helpful at all. So rather than try to unload the Roku 2 to someone else (Roku wouldn't take it back and I couldn't find my sale slip to return it to Walmart), I found that Amazon had a supplier of infra-red remotes that worked with my Roku 2 player and I figured that would fix my problems.

Since using this new infra-red remote I have had absolutely no problems using my Roku 2 player.    Now if I could only find out why the Roku 2 clock won't update, automatically or manually. So far, the clock problem has not caused me any problems with the streaming channels therefore no harm, no foul.    P.S.

{"text":"I too read all the reviews and was a little aprehensive about purchasing this Panasonic as my very first Blu-Ray player, however the price was too good to ignore so I took a chance.\r\nMaybe not everyone is patient or bothers to read EVERYTHING that comes with new electronic devices first, but I followed the directions for setup and absolutely nothing went wrong when I first powered it up, downloaded the firmware upadate, let it reset itself, and voila' there it was ready to go! No hicups, no unresponsive remote, and no freezes.\r\nI don't own any Blu-Ray discs yet so I popped in both Avatar and The Dark Knight DVD and let me tell you the 1080i upconversion was great. I know it's not Blu-Ray quality but it's like breathing new life into your beloved DVD collection as they light up your HDTV in a whole new way. Can't wait to rent some Blu-Rays and see what I've been missing.\r\nLet's be real here guys, for the price you pay I was only going to use this player strictly to watch movies on and NOT for it's minimum (3 services only!) streaming capability. Do like I do and use a Roku for HD streaming and let my other \"dumb\" devices just do what they were primarily built to do. For the price you pay, you can't go wrong with this device, just don't expect it to do what other players twice it's price easily do.","is_deceptive":false}

This one is for the Compact and Sub-Compact PX4, so it will NOT sit on your full sized PX4 rail properly and therefore will NOT fit as securely as you'll need it to. This one is the FQ150C (the \"C\" is for Compact) (ASIN: B0051W6CQ8)\r\nFor the full sized PX4 Storm you'll need to order the \"Aim Sports 150 Lumens Flashlight with Qrl Color Filtered Lenses\" model number FQ150 (no \"C\") (ASIN: B00551H96W).\r\nThis FQ150C light is VERY bright, very solid and very nice. The quick detach mount is an excellent feature if you desire easy attachment\/removal.\r\nAlso, it does have a temporary \"ON\" setting. Once you've pressed the switch to turn the light \"ON\" you can press the switch lightly to temporarily turn the light \"OFF\", releasing the light pressure will turn the light back \"ON\". Then, to turn the light completely \"OFF\" depress the button fully.\r\nAt a little over $30, this is a very good buy. I would recommend it. Just make certain you're ordering the proper AIM Sport light for your compact\/sub-compact or full size PX4.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Just, first, a little background.  Photography is my hobby not my profession.  I have had several cameras over the years from a Canon T1i, to a Sony A55, to a Sony A77, to a Sony A7.  I have just replaced the A7 with an A7r.  I first bought the A7 thinking that the A7r was terrible at focusing.  I was able to try a A7r at the CES show.  I found that the focusing was really not an issue.  So I sold my A7 and got the A7r.\r\nFOCUSING - Focusing is really not a issue with me.  I have used the A7r  for a month now.  It focuses quickly in almost all lighting conditions.  The only time that it does not focus well is in pitch black rooms, but then there is nothing to take a picture off.  I took pictures of the interiors of homes with no flash and had no problems focusing.  I have taken pictures of fast action sports.  This camera is a little slow for that purpose, but you can prefocus on a spot and wait for the action.  This works great.  I had a hard time focusing on birds in flight (BIF) but did manage to get a few good shots (manual focus to infinity and capture the bird.)\r\nLIGHT LEAKS - I do not normally take long exposures with my lens cap on, so this has not been an issue with me.\r\nBATTERY LIFE - This is a weakness.  I have just bought several more batteries and carry them with me.  I have also bought a external charger.  I like the internal charger; this way I can charge two batteries at a time.  I normally drain 1 1\/2 batteries during a day of heavy shooting.\r\nLENS - There are not many full frame e-mount lenses available.  If you buy the appropriate metabones adapter, just about any lens will work.  I have a TAMRON 18-200 lens (to get image stabilization,  sony has disabled this with their e-mount lens).  I get 15 mega-pixel images.  This is plenty resolution for me.  I also have the Zeiss 24-70 lens to use for high quality work.  And boy the detail really overwhelms me.  Since there is no anti aliasing filter the sharpness isgreat in the center of the frame.  Images are slightly soft at the corners but I like that.  It brings the viewer focus towards the center of the frame.\r\nSUMMARY - There is no perfect camera in all respects.  The Sony A7r is the closest that I have found.  It has excellent image quality for a great price (full frame comparisons).  I would highly recommend this camera to photography enthusiasts.  If you are a pro then I think that one for the Canikon cameras in the $5,000.00 price range may be a better fit.  I would recommend the A7r over the A7.  I have had both.  The A7r image quality is significantly better.\r\nHappy shooting !!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I used this for a theater gig while playing keyboard. The light not only brightened up every inch of the music on the stand but also my entire 88-key keyboard, without blinding a single audience member. The LED lights never produce heat, allowing me to adjust the light at any time without risk of burning myself. The flexible neck allows for any creative positioning imaginable, holding any position for an unlimited amount of time.\r\nIf there is anything to critique, it is the clip itself, which doesn't hold quite as securely to my music stand as I would hope, though there is no risk of it falling off, it just may wiggle a bit. However, once it is set to my liking, it really only wiggles when I try to do so. No movement occurs just from setting a book on the stand or turning pages.\r\nAlthough I haven't used it for any purposes beside reading music, I'm sure other creative uses would prove effective as well. The option to either use AC power or batteries is very nice, as you don't need to waste battery power when you can conveniently plug it in. Keep a twist-tie or rubber band handy though, as the power cord is quite long.\r\nThe bag is nice for storing and keeping off dust when not in use. I was attracted to the fact that the light uses cheaper AA batteries as opposed to the more expensive AAA or coin batteries, and it comes with the batteries, too. Considering the quality and all the accessories, I don't foresee needing to spend any bucks on this or any new light for quite awhile.","is_deceptive":false}

Aesthetically I liked it, I know my son will like it also because of the football and it matched with his green samsonite school bag.\r\nWhen the lunch bag arrived I sighed because it looked small but I tested it putting all the paraphernalia I send my son with to school. I will be detailed to give you an idea: 1 juice (Welch's 10fl. oz.)or Apple's and Eve box juice, 2 snacks (if it is the size of potato chips) 3 snacks if it is smaller packed snack like a granola bar or 4 biscuit snacks, 1 bowl for his lunch (approx 2 1\/2\" deep 3\" wide square shaped), 1 small towel (so he can use as a table mat for his lunch), 1 small bottle of hand sanitizer (a 2 or 3oz bottle, small)  and 1 fork or spoon when necessary. Let me tell you, I dont regret buying that lunch bag for 1 second! Everything fit perfectly!\r\nWe had issues with the last lunch bag we bought on amazon (not amazon's fault the make of the bag needed some tweaking for the use of a child) whenever my son held the handle the flap pulled with the weight due to the contents of the bag. Complete opposite with this lunch bag (besides it not having an opening flap) when my son holds this lunch bag containing the aforementioned items, its very manageable for a child and weighs (feels) almost 'light'. I dont know how that is possible but it is.\r\nCleaning is easy, I guess you could follow the instructions. I just use a damp cloth and it wipes clean. It looks like it may last more than one school year! By the way, my son has been using it since the beginning of the new school year and it is going strong. I highly recommend this lunch bag.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I got this in and installed it the same day.  Many reviewers will note that it is too narrow to span two studs.  My installation was a brick wall on the exterior of my house so this was not an issue.  The included anchors worked great for this.  Drill a 3\/8 hole for the anchors, NOT the slightly larger M10 that is recommended in the instructions.  I drilled 3\/8 with intentions to enlarge the hole from there but found the anchors fit almost loose in the smaller hole and any larger would have been a problem. Also, for any led small enough for this bracket will work fine in drywall with the anchors.  My 32in is only 10.1 pounds, and many 40\" led TVs are around 19 pounds  You need a hammer drill to drill into concrete or brick!  You will burn up masonry bits and spend hours fighting it with a regular drill.  With a hammer drill installing this will be a 15 minute job.  I don't know if the product has changed or not, but after reading reviews of this being thin and cheap I can say there is no way mine is the same as theirs, you can't mistake this for cheap.

{"text":"I purchased the Gaiters as Christmas gifts last year so my daughter and I can enjoy snowshoeing without becoming cold and miserable with wet legs and feet.  Unfortunately, Mother Nature conspired to not snow very much here in southern Nevada last winter and limited our time in the snow.  This year; however, is a different story. A friend and I traveled to Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks National Monument during Veteran's Day weekend.  We drove into a significant snow storm and after the weather cleared we hiked in fresh snow at Cedar Breaks.  Long story short, I'm glad we packed the gaiters for the trip.  Cedar Break's recieved over two feet snow during the storm and got the chance to use the gaiters over our hiking boots.  Overall, these gaiters did the trick during the hiking at 10,000ft keeping us dry in deep snow - these gaiters ride high up to the knee which is perfect for tall folks, like me.  The only miss with these gaiters are the strapping mechanism going under the boots, essentially, a string that needs to knotted.  It was a little challenging squaring away the knot when the air temperature was around 0 dgs, but, we were able to get the gaiters secured and we move about the mountain with the greatest of easy and comfort.  Good product for those who are outdoor types and need to keep dry in wet\/snow conditions.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The watchband on my  had become tattered, so it was time to upgrade it or get rid of the watch. But why trash a perfectly good timepiece that had proven itself to be so reliable since I had purchased it new here back in 2008? As they say, \"It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.\"      Started searching for a decent 20mm sports watchband that was reasonably priced and not designed to look  on my watch, as are some of them. Maybe I'm too conservative, but there were  that just weren't my style. Contemplated a stainless steel link band, such as this , but had to rule it out as I didn't know how it would look on my old favorite watch.      By chance I found this  and it seemed to be a decent choice, though it was called a long length band in the specs, and I have an average wrist. Still, it's better to have one a bit long than too short, and considering that the price was reasonable, ordered it here. When it arrived a couple of days later (and thanks, Amazon Prime), took it out of the package and looked it over. It did indeed have a 20mm band width, came with a pair of replacement stainless steel spring bars, and easy to see that it was black leather... but it appeared to be a slightly different product from the one here in the photos. The end wasn't pointed as is shown in Voguestrap's product photos, but more of a squared end sport strap similar to that on the , if their image is correct.      The other thing that was different was that the band is slightly padded, and not flat, and the buckle is not the shiny one as pictured. The one that I received had a brushed steel look, as one can see in the photos that I've posted here.      Allsaid and done, I like this band more than the one that's there in Voguestrap's product photos. But it does serve as a reminder to all of us to check the specs carefully before ordering a product.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I really wanted to like this bracelet. Yes, it looks GREAT. The clarity and cut of swarovski crystals is fantastic, and Amazon did a great job and procuring a bracelet that was well built. All gems are centered properly, links are clean (a little rough in terms of fluidity in the chain though). There's no ugly glue, off-centering, different sized\/clarity gems on this.\r\nTwo things:\r\n1) The bracelet arrives in two plastic bags inside of a manila envelope. So make sure you get a box to go with it. There's also a tag that says \"MADE IN CHINA\" along with the Swarovski certification tag. So make sure you remove that. Nothing says \"I love you.. kind of\" than a big \"MADE IN CHINA\" tag still on a piece of jewelry.\r\n2) THE CLASP! What people are saying is true. This is a hit and miss. If you're not doing much and you wear short sleeves or a dress, you should not have significant issues\/risks of losing the bracelet. If you're wearing a sweater or jacket or something that is porous, this bracelet WILL catch the fabric and flip open one of the clasps within a few minutes of merely walking and swinging your arms. We knew the risk and tested the bracelet out when it first arrived. One clasp opened quickly. Merely putting your hand down on the table with the release lever facing down was enough to disengage the bracelet when both clasps were missing. Upon further inspection, the diamonds on top of the clasp itself seem weird, since they're not aligned with the rest of the bracelet. A watch style clasp with just a smooth locking mechanism would have been MUCH better in comparison.\r\nSo yes. This is a great piece. But it's not for every day use, which is why ultimately we decided to return it. If you know you won't wear it with sleeves, your risk of it catching are greatly reduced (warning: it can catch on the seams of your pants). It looks great, expensive, but the high risk of it falling and being lost forever are too great to justify keeping it.\r\nFYI, we bought the 7.25\" length and it was a good fit.","is_deceptive":false}

Set-up is quick, but there are so many options that the experienced consumer like me can go back and tinker for a long time in all the menus.\r\nOn the plus side: Only 2.2cents per day to operate; amazingly light(12 lb.s); slim cabinet; easy to use remote control.  It has 'Clear Voice' which is intended to emphasize speech but is helpful only in this function.\r\nOn the negative side: It DOES work with computers but does NOT have RGB so it's useless for my PC at the moment. I could buy a PC-TV card, but am slightly surprised at this omission.  Also, compared to my Toshiba, it does not do well with 2nd rate signals.  Unless you have HDMI, you'll have an acceptable picture but nothing approaching 'hi def'.  I have it on a simple video\/audio RCA connection and its picture is fine, but far from stellar...The major shortcoming on the set, and virtually all sets short of the premium large ones is sound.  A wafer thin plastic cabinet does not provide a means of resonance nor of having proper speakers. As a 2nd set for a room, it's OK; for a primary use set, you should add supplemental speakers, etc.\r\nThe key thing to remember is no RGB computer hookup.

{"text":"I bought this drop leg holster because I wanted a versatile platform that would accomodate several pistols with or without lights. I like the fact that it can also be used as a belt holster or attached to a vest.\r\nPro: Versatile, holds pistol without light somewhat securely (read cons), durable materials, very good craftsmanship\r\nCon: You do have to set up the holster to fit your size and weapon. Not really a con but rather a fact. However, the instruction manual to set up the holster is lacking. The technical writer needs to be smacked in the back of the head. Clearer diagrams would have been helpful. Once you figure it out, the set up is not too bad if not a bit finicky. The holster IS bulky. I have a Bladetech Revolution holster attached to a Bladetech drop leg platform and it has a narrower profile. I wanted a drop leg that you could roll around on the ground with. I scratched up the Kydex on the Bladetech doing this. While the material is very durable it's also quite stiff. It'll probably soften up with use. I can't seem to get the bellows that accomodates the light to close down enough to prevent the pistol from rocking a bit fore and aft(the pistol doesn't have a light attached).\r\nAddendum: I had to return this holster due to the retension strap snap not being strong enough and the bellows being too loose. The rocking of the pistol fore and aft became a real issue. I could not cinch the bellows down enough to prevent this. I took a Weapons Retension course one night and one of the drills was to have others try and take your pistol (unloaded and safety checked, of course) from your holster. Because the bellows is held down by velcro straps a quick yank rearward would release the straps and loosen the pistol enough that anyone could easily pull out the pistol. Not good in any situation. I think it might have been different if I was running the pistol with a light but I wanted the option to go with or without the light on the pistol. I'm rethinking this strategy and am considering a drop leg dedicated to the make and model of my pistol.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Too ultra-light action of rod throughout length of this rod.  To fix that, I pulled in the last section of the rod to down into the rod & glued it there, making the rod not as whippy.  Then I noticed the amount of arc\/bending of the rod is same all the way down to the handle, which means if you wanted to reel in any small lure you wouldnt feel the lure, meaning you also would have a tough time detecting a nibble if using bait without a bobber.  So you're limited to just bobber fishing with this rod, & even then only if you had shortened the rod like I did so the rod wouldn't bend into a circle if you caught a small fish.  Also btw the eyelets are all-metal instead of any ceramic inside the loops to avoid eventually tearing line, but can live with all-metal guides at this cheap price, it's the arc all the way down to the base that I don't like.\r\nOn the plus side, the grip on this handle is nice comfortable sponge.

{"text":"Buying a travel system can be confusing. I went to Graco's website and still had a hard time telling why some cost more than others and I always find that it's something silly like adjustable height for the handle or something.  I have this system  to compare to.    So what do you get?  A car seat.  A base for the car seat.  A stroller.    The stroller is going to have the most feature difference between all the travel systems.  This stroller has one hand closing system. There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright.    I can't open it one-handed though.    The other Graco system I mentioned above had the handle in the base of the stroller that you pull and and it folds (almost lifting it). I like this one better.    This system has locks for the front wheels if you don't want them to swivel (manual mentions grass).    The storage area is bigger on this system.    The base is different also. The old base I have has a bubble-level to get the seat in the car at the right angle. The problem with that is that there is so much leeway that it was useless.    This system does away with the bubble and has a red line on the base that must be level with the ground. I would get a level and hold it against that red line.    The car seat is good (and pretty much the same as other snugrides) and highly recommended from multiple sources.    The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was waiting for this 2012 model TV since I saw it at CES expo, because this 80 inch is the largest 240hz 3d TV so far. I didn't expected this TV to release in March, 2012.    Anyways I bought it from Amazon via Paul's TV for $4472+tax (Los angeles tax=8.75%). Cost me total of $4863.57 with free \"white glove\" fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday March 31st, and got it delivered on Monday April 2nd, barely just like next day delivery.    Considering myself a smart shopper, I actually did some research for the price check. All other places were $1000 or more even at my favorite Frys electronics store, but I still went to Frys electronics to see this TV in action, but Frys personnel said it hasn't been put on display yet, as it's been barely 3 days since they recieved this model. Anyhow I told them at Amazon it's cheaper price, and they were just amazed! to see the price difference. The have to call their manager to match it up. Finally they were able to match it up but they came up with delivery fee of $75.00. I still wanted to go with it but somehow I just remembered that being a Chase freedom credit card customer, I get an additional 5% cash back on purchases made from Amazon.com for the first quarter of 2012. So I end up buying at amazon.com for bigger savings and free shipping with white glove delivery.    Next day amazon bumped up the price for this TV. Lucky enough, I saved ridiculously $1000 just in overnight. I bet you they realized that they were selling the TV for a cheaper price than any other competitors.    Let's get to the point of Cons and Pros of this TV discussing some key features and comparing with my other Samsung 55inch 8000 led series of 2010 model.    Pros: It plays MKV format out of the box. Built in WiFi. Web browser.  Dedicated button for Netflix on remote. Hulu plus,YouTube with HD feature, Vudu, etc. Active 3D not like other 3D TV manufacturers which use passive technology. It's 240hz and motion plus to 480Hz, with contrast Ratio of 1:10 million. DLNA certified. More speaker output power of an additional 15 Watts of Bass as compared to all other LED TV manufacturers.    Cons: It won't connect to portable Hard drive via USB. It only connects to electric powered hard drive and flash memory sticks (as written in instruction manual). When watching over the air channels via HD antenna, it won't give you detailed description of the TV program you are watching except the name of the program. It won't give you any info of the TV episode program in advance, that what is going to come next unlike my Samsung TV does. When using DLNA networking, it won't play MKV files. It only plays MKV files via when using USB port but not with portable hard drive as I said above.    Rest if you want to buy any HDMI cables, or wall mount brackets, then I suggest you to buy at [...]. They are simply the cheapest.    Any suggestions or questions are most welcomed.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased from Walmart for $250($268 after tax). Took me about 10 minutes to hook everything up -- sat back on the couch for an hour listening and adjusting levels with different movies\/music. The system looks clean and goes well with my 46 inch Samsung. The remote that came with the speakers worked with my TV right out of the box -- and I like it better than my stock TV remote so I'll be using the new one from now on. I also like the USB plug on the right side of the bar so I can plug my phone in to charge or listen to music. I've been listening to music\/movies for the last 4 hours and here's what I've noticed so far...\r\nLow Levels\r\n - Since the sub is so weak, you'll have to turn the sub to the highest setting if you really want to feel it in your bones. And when you crank a speaker up to the highest volume, you almost never get a clean sound. It's not HORRIBLE, but I feel like SAMSUNG really could have satisfied people a lot more if they included a more powerful sub. For movies it's not so bad, but the bass isn't crisp and sharp with songs that have a lot of kicks or 808's with low frequencies.\r\nMids\/Highs\r\n - The range of the actual sound bar itself is incredible...there's a real distinction between the mid\/lower and highest frequencies which are all driven out at different angles so they hit your ears to closely resemble a 5.1 system. I did notice slight clipping noises when the upper range hit higher volumes though -- hopefully this will go away after the speakers get broken in. The sound really is beautiful though and I'm happy with the look\/sound of the bar.\r\nI'll definitely enjoy these for now but I'm not impressed with the sub. I'm waiting for Vizio to release their new system which is supposed to be the next best thing since sliced bread. I'll compare the two and pick whichever ends up sounding better...but for now the E450's will be a huge upgrade from my stock TV speakers.","is_deceptive":false}

It's difficult to get used to typing on it as there's a good deal of friction. I have made far more frequent typing errors with the Kuzy on. And now it's pretty much useless. The snugness hasn't lasted. It's become loose to the point of come off the keyboard surface as I type. Yeah, it looks great. In theory, it protects against debris. It absolutely does not prevent against spill damage. Of course, I didn't expect that from a $6.95 product.

{"text":"I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of using TC's generally speaking but my opinion has been based on shooting film from decades ago. I wondered if maybe technology had caught up and if today's tele-converters were better than the ones I remembered. I ordered the Kenko after reading several reviews figuring for the price, I can't get hurt too badly. My experience with the Kenko 1.4x did not impress me. Build quality seemed good. Not great, but good. The TC fit well on my D750 with no discernible \"play\". With a lens attached there was a tiny wiggle. The TC works best with Nikon lenses; but this should not be surprising. What was a little surprising was just how bad the image quality was when used in conjunction with a non-Nikon lens. Using the Kenko with my Sigma 50mm f\/1.4 Art series lens, for example, was a complete disaster. Used with a Nikon 85mm f\/1.8G image sharpness was clearly degraded but still very acceptable. Chromatic aberration was apparent however and that kind of bugged me. Yes, I can remove with Photoshop but I prefer not having it to begin with. Auto-focus generally seemed to \"flutter\" and struggle a bit, even in full sunlight, but focus-lock did happen. In summary, I'd say this is a pretty mediocre piece of kit. I won't be keeping mine but I'm really picky about my image quality. For more casual shooters, this is probably a nice addition to the bag. For the serious hobbyist or pro shooter, however, I'd have to say the Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX is probably a non-starter.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have an HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer) in my living room, and this is the way we do pretty much everything involving the TV. Since I sit about 10' away from the TV, I don't have a wired mouse or keyboard and instead use blue-tooth ones (regular wireless is unreliable for gaming at that range). With the mouse, this isn't really inconvenient at all, but it's kind of a pain to pull out the keyboard, wait for it to connect, and then type with it in my lap. Enter the iPazzPort.\r\nPros:\r\n-It's tiny, about the size of most modern smartphones but lighter-weight.\r\n-It connects instantly.\r\n-Typing is easy and instinctive after years of using smartphones.\r\n-Fully charges quickly and then keeps a charge for several days with moderate use.\r\n-Sleek look that doesn't look at all out of place on a living room side table or desk.\r\n-Includes a mouse function (more on this in the cons).\r\nCons:\r\n-The mouse function is sort of bad. It uses an accelerometer to determine the mouse position, but it's not very responsive. It took me a couple of weeks to figure out that you need to point the device toward the monitor like a remote control for it to work. Once you've done this, it does work, but it's still not very accurate.\r\n-The remote control function did not work for my television (and I couldn't figure out how to make it work with my sound system, yet). I have pretty much zero need for this function, though, so it's not a big deal.\r\n-The instructions are poorly translated from Chinese to English (this isn't a big deal at all, but maybe a better translation would have made the mouse thing more clear to me).\r\n-There is no visible indication that the battery is low (which is strange, seeing as it already has a red\/blue LED). You figure out the battery is low when you start having to press a key several times to type.\r\nOverall, this is an amazing product that I think is a must-have for any HTPC set-up.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"A one of a kind, indie masterpiece. A dark and hypnotic drama that simultaneously explores the ecstasy of new found love and the wrenching pain of loss. Transatlantic teeters on the edge of a fever dream, but never falls off giving it a thrilling undercurrent, even when its pacing is deliberate and almost meditative. All of this while exhibiting an eroticism and honesty about sex that is all but nonexistent in mainstream American cinema. And I would be remiss if I didn't point out the beautiful and hardened lines of New York City serve as the perfect backdrop to the story.

That being said, it has a small profile and is easily tucked away.\r\nI was impressed with how sturdy this item was. Putting it together was pretty intuitive, though I did check the directions once or twice. We have solid surface granite countertops, and I was pleased with how well the suction adhered. This little gadget wasn't going anywhere while I was mincing.\r\nUnlike the picture, you can't stick an entire carrot in the mincer and expect it to mince. (That's the only reason I knocked off a star - I feel like the picture is misleading). This thing is dependent on your strength to mince--it's not a powered item--so you have to work pretty hard to get it to mince even large pieces of carrot. It works best when you cut items into smaller pieces. And despite the fact that it's advertised as a carrot mincer, you can mince other items in here as well.

The chapters take differing looks at the linkage of inequality with democracy. Some are more qualitative, others more quantitative. There is even an effort to use quantitative techniques to analyze Athenian democracy!\r\nOne of the more interesting chapters is an essay by Edward Muller, in which he statistically analyzes the relationship on inequality to democracy (chapter 5). In several tables reported in this chapter, he finds that greater inequality is associated with lower scores on a democracy index across countries. Another chapter (by Ember, Ember, and Russett) indicates that greater inequality goes with less voice from citizens.\r\nOther chapters take a more exotic approach.\r\nHowever, in the end, this is a fascinating, although somewhat idiosyncratic work, on an important subject.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I love this sequel.  It is one of the few sequels that measures up to the first.  Batman is still a very conflicted guy.  Then Selena Kyle is a mild wimpy secretary who knows a little self-defense.  After she gets pushed out of a window, saved by some cats she becomes changed and the secret part of her that was hidden away comes out to play.  The Penguin is a slightly sympathetic but in general evil and sadistic.  I love Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.  She is both a good guy and a bad guy and not very manipulative.  I love because she is a complete b**ch, but in a good way.  No one pushes her around and those that do she gets even with.  Although she and Batman do start a relationship she can't deny who she truly is and she would rather be that than be with him.  The Penguin gets his comeuppance.  Selena gets even with Max who pushed her out of the window. Batman aka Bruce knows at the end that she is still roaming the streets and he can count her to be an ally as long as he doesn't get in her way!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"It's a coffee table sized book packed full of natural history with brilliant color illustrations and loads of fascinating  facts based on recent scientific discoveries.  I remember getting toy plastic dinosaurs when I was a child and they were all grey or brown with hard smooth skins.  Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose. Beginning with a brief exposition of the evolution of animals with backbones, the book goes from the Triassic to the Cenozoic (the rise of the first large mammals)\r\nNot just fascinating facts about dinosaurs, but also information about creatures that don't get a lot of attention, like Titanoboa, a gigantic South American snake that was as long as a school bus. There's also the two and half meter tall flightless bird and the Andrewsarchus.\r\nI've had this on book on my desk for a week now and it never fails to catch the attention of the numerous adults who wonder through.  They inevitably pick it up and I've had to rescue it a couple of times from being carried off by rapt readers.\r\nThis one is mine, but I know a couple of dinosaur obsessed children who are going to get copies as holiday gifts.  I thoroughly recommend this book.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've owned several Mackie mixers going back a good many years to when they were all made in the U.S., and were the standard for compact, high quality boards; I still have a 4-channel Mackie USB mixer I use for doing basic recording on my Mac. The old ones were real pro gear that could stand up to the rigors of gigging. I don't think the newer made in China boards are of the same quality, but they're certainly good enough for light gigging and more than sturdy enough for home recording.  This particular mixer has four mic preamps, four stereo line inputs, and enough sends and returns to set up a flexible PA or a good basic home recording studio. The mic preamps sound okay to my ears, noise levels are low, and the controls are quiet. Yes, it has a cheesy power supply (this can be replaced) and the outputs pop who you plug it in (what were they thinking??) but this can be dealt with in a PA or studio setting by turning on the power amp(s) or monitors *after* you turn on the board. The multiple effects consist of several reverbs and echoes and a few phaser\/flanger effects useful for recording and less so for live sound. The quality is about what you'd expect from a guitar pedal, and you could probably do better with the effects in your recording software (which would have the added advantage of being reversible.)  While there are a number of annoyances,makeup in mind that with all the functionality available, this board costs less than a decent microphone, and for that reason alone it's a very good choice for a band or soloist or home recorder starting out. At the asking price, I think it's a very good value, too.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is probably one of the most exciting gifts you can give to a young child. Most kids are fascinated with the concept of driving. So having a little vehicle they can safely maneuver is awesome. We purchased this type of vehicle for all 3 of my kids. Everyone of them was thrilled. In fact, we parked them inside the garage facing forward as though they were \"parked\".\r\nThis one sits a little high, so the child has to climb up to get on it. But they won't mind.\r\nI would highly recommend elbow pads and a helmet. Though we've not seen our 4 wheeler turn over on us yet, but there were a couple of times going over some big bumps on the hilly areas that it looked as though it might tip. So steer your kids away from really bumpy areas and stay on mostly level ground. This is not a TRUE 4 wheeler. It is not designed for rough terrain. It is a TOY.\r\nWhen it first arrives at your house, it might be best not to let the little ones know it's there. It has to be partly assembled and charge overnight (you have to plug it in) before it can be used. If you charge it less than the recommended time, the battery will never hold a charge for long.\r\nBeing that it runs on an oversize battery, it's only good for about 20 minutes of constant riding before it starts to lose some power.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"This truly is a beautiful set that is sure to complete any outfit and get you many compliments. The bracelet does seem to run small but I have smaller wrists so that is something to keep in mind when purchasing. The earrings shimmer very nicely and have metal backs. I have sensitive ears and worried about having silver backs, but my ears were fine and didn't seem to get irritated from them. The cell phone bling is perfect and adds so much style to my phone. It also protects the headphone jack from getting anything in it. The bracelet is gorgeous. It shuts very easily and there is no worry about a clasp with this item. It stays on securely. The necklace chain seems to be just the right amount of length. Clasp on the necklace is easy to open and closes nicely. It seems durable as it hasn't broke yet and I have worn this for over a week daily to check. I have also messed with it as well. The chain is really dainty but hasn't ripped and I am pretty notorious with doing that. The charm is brilliant. It shimmers and shines and the gem seems to catch the light at all the right angles. This is a cute set.","is_deceptive":true}

One version is a newer model I guess and it has slight differences from the one I received (I know this because my brother purchased the same knife and his is the newer version)\r\nThe spring in the back of mine looks like a little black straw, the newer version has a spring that sits flush along the entire back of the knife. The newer model has CRKT on the pocket clip were the older one does not. The CRKT image on the blade is removed on the newer one leaving just the CRKT letters.\r\nThe knife is extremely hard to open at first using the thumb stud. I found that I was rubbing the skin on my thumb raw trying to open it. I put some oil on it and it helped a bit but not much. It has been four days since I received it and I can tell it is becoming easier for it to open with the thumb stud, I guess you can call it a breaking in period, keep in mind I have been opening and closing it every day probably 50 times a day. For the majority of the time I had to use a paper towel to open it because it was cutting my thumb.\r\nOther than that problem, this is a beautiful knife and I am sure I will become more happy with the product as it becomes easier to open.\r\nAlthough I wish CRKT wouldn't sell the new and old model for the same price (I feel like the older version should be cheaper) or at the very least let customers know which one they are buying, I am happy with this product and will keep it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"*** Updated Review:  Be Aware of Roast Date to avoid older roast date Beans.  Coffee Beans are to be enjoyed when they are fresh roasted.  They are a perishable product that can go stale.    I have been subscribing to this product, and have often being sent older stored roasted date beans.  Fresh roasted coffee beans reach their \"peak\" at about 2 weeks after roasting, and diminish from there.  My last shipment was 3 month old beans under my 'Subscribe and Save'.  The original beans are quite good, but no longer being 'fresh roasted' by the time I receive them was disappointing   I had to discontinue the Subscribe and Save as a result of this...    How to read a Coffee Bean Direct Date Code at the bottom of 5lb bag:  First off, the \"Expiration Date\" is exactly 1 year from the Roast\/Packing Date.    Second, the date code is written as such: (example) \"26714.02 \"  EQUALS \"267\"th day of year (20)\"14\" . batch \"02\".  267th day of year is Sept 24th; 14 is year 2014; .02 is 2nd batch of day....    Being sent 3 month old beans is the fault of warehouse inventory control.  I believe the vendor does freshly pack his beans, and sends to Amazon warehouse.  Then Amazon stockpiles it into warehouse storage, and ships out older stockpiles...  I really want freshest roast date product, so I have to again change vendor sources...    **** Original Review***  I have been using Malabar Monsooned beans for about 8 Years, and I am glad to have this new source to choose from.  I feel that monsooned malabar is optimal for Cappuccinos, as its smoothness complements micro-foamed milk quite well.  My first pull from this new order had a very nice crema, dark golden colored as hoped for and expected. Smooth and rich.  City Roasted, roasted till the first crack and allowed to rest before finishing, had the characteristics I wanted, not too darkly roasted...  So for people who want to grind their beans via a burr grinder, and pull a golden shot via their dialed in espresso machine, I can recommend this.  I don't use this for drip coffee, so I can't comment on that, but this makes a pretty good cappuccino via my Gaggia Classic.  4.25 Stars","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I have been steeped in digital photography for over a decade and have quite a few cameras to fit my needs.  I'm not a totally gear-head - I do tend to prefer cameras that work well in pure automatic mode, reserving manual fine tuning for rare occasions.  In other words, a camera that is only serviceable via RAW mode is no use for me.  I have three cameras in my arsenal right now, the , , and the .  The A4000IS is really the camera for the kids, but the S100 is my pocket camera and the 20D DSLR is my good camera for when I don't mind the weight.\r\nSo where does the Fuji H50EXR fit into this picture?  This is a bridge camera, with the body profile of a DSLR, but the lens is not interchangeable and the cost is far less.  There are plenty of extensive reviews on the web, so I'm hoping my review can provide insight beyond the encyclopedic coverage on features you will never use.\r\nIn short, this camera has three strong points going for it - the 42x zoom, the 24mm wide angle, and the f2.8 aperture opening.  That's not to say there aren't other great features (like a bright LCD, HD movie recording, etc), but those are what sets it out at this price point.\r\nMost people know why 42x zoom is important.  Note that this is a purely optical zoom, not digital.  Digital zoom just takes a high resolution photo and pre-crops it.  Optical zoom preserves the image quality.  With the 1000mm lens, you can zoom into far away objects quite easily.  The zoom is manual, a nice feature when zooming during a video, or when you need to zoom quickly.  Many cameras are near useless at maxmium zoom without a tripod because the image blurs, but the built-in image stabilization means that the 42x is quite usable.\r\nIt is also nice that the lens can go to 24mm.  That means you can do easier shots indoors when the subject is near you - this is effectively a wide-angle or macro-type setting.  Many super zoom lenses cannot also do the 24mm setting.\r\nSo what is f2.8 and why should you care?  The f-setting refers to how wide the aperture can open.  While the f2.8 only applies at the widest setting, it is significantly better than competing cameras, many of which are closer to f3.5.  In dark rooms, a camera with a lower f-setting will let in more light and get lighter pictures with shorter exposure time.\r\nWhat else does the camera offer?  It has some cool features such as a built-in panorama stitch mode and a 480fps movie mode for making slow-motion videos.  These features are mostly for fun.  The panorama stitch mode unfortunately only does vertical resolution of 1080 pixels, or less than 1\/3 the normal vertical resolution of a still photo.  The 480fps mode also is extremely low resolution and is neat, but almost unusable as the video is so hard to see.\r\nThere are some facts of life with this camera.  You can't get a pitcher of orange juice from one orange, nor can you get the best images from a small sensor and smaller optics.  The sensor is small, only 1\/2\", which means that images will have more noise than DSLR cameras with larger sensors.  While large sensors have started to filter into the lower-end space, they don't come in cameras that have 42x zooms or cost less than $500.  Camera specifications for a given price range have give and take.  The  might have a large beautiful sensor, but the kit lens is only 55mm, not 1000mm.  Add on a better lens and you're into DSLR territory.  In short, a camera must be evaluated on imagequality within the price range of the camera.\r\nThere are some similar market competitors with even better zooms for similar camera bodies, but of course many don't have all of the extra features like panorama or the really wide aperture.\r\nAll of that being said, it's a 4 star camera.  I was disappointed that they didn't include a manual and I had to download it off the web.  I couldn't find any method to show a histogram of the picture during review, a useful feature to know if the photo is properly exposed.  It has since been pointed out to me how to do it, so I can say it does have histogram, but I still couldn't find it easily.  The camera screen also didn't give me useful feedback in manual mode to know if the picture would be properly exposed once taken as I adjusted the aperture and shutter speed.  I had to click and find out.  A manual focus wheel, a multi-purpose adjust dial, and a \"quick\" menu are a manual do-it-yourselfer's dream, but you will take some time to get used to these.\r\nI also found the user interface a little cumbersome.  Given that this is a new camera, it's about time they went touchscreen and got rid of all of these buttons.  Browsing and zooming on photos you took requires two buttons near the front of the top and the scroll wheel on the back.  In quite a few uses, you will find yourself going all over the camera looking for the right button.  I acknowledge that some of this may be familiarity - I know Canon better than Fuji - it just seems that they didn't make this as easy as they could have for new photographers.  The interface just felt clunky and not well organized.\r\nOther shortcomings?  The flash must be manually opened and the zoom is also a little stiff compared to my DSLR to turn.  Truthfully, the camera is surprisingly heavy for its position as a bridge camera.  It's honestly not much lighter than my DSLR, and when I went out with it on a hike today, wondered why I didn't just bring my DSLRalong.  Granted, I normally carry a 270mm lens and not a 1000mm one, but I was still surprised by the weight.  That being said, not everyone can afford a DSLR, making this an excellent choice as a value high-end camera.\r\nDespite smaller shortcomings, this is a nice camera that you can take from the box, put into \"auto\" mode, and start taking nice photos.  If you value the 1000x zoom, the f2.8 setting, and the lower cost, it is a fine choice for general purpose use and for a low-cost alternative to a DSLR that gets you a wide aperture and excellent zoom.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The HS-81 and the counterpart the HS-82MG are great servos for their size and weight class (there's a new 82HB in the works). These are Analog servos, the Digital versions have 4 digit names, so for example the digital version of the HS-82 servo is HS-5082 (there is no digital HS-81). The digital versions have higher resolution and are important to use in critical areas such as tail accuracy on a Helicopter. For most general purpose flying, analog servos work great.\r\nI use a lot of servos.  Keeping a dozen planes and gliders in flyable states causes me to continually build, rebuild and evaluate my servos so I write with the experience of many years.  The HS-81 is very popular for ailerons and flaps, when on a budget but honestly I've blown a few out and had better success switching to the HS-82MG servo, it's not much heavier and the metal gears keep the gears from getting ripped out..  One installation issue is that you'll have to watch the servo width depending on your wing thickness to make sure it fits in there.  If your wings are too thin you'll need to move to the HS-65MG\/HB versions.\r\nThis plastic geared servo weighs 16.6 grams and has 2.6kg of torque at 4.8v and 3.0kg of torque at 6.0v.  In general the MG servos are stronger but have a bit more play than the HB or plastic gears do.  Due to these subtle differences, I pick which to use in any given situation based on how the servos will be abused.  For Glider Flaps where the gears are often stripped due to dragging on the ground during the landing, I use the MG servos.  For the more sensitive Ailerons, I prefer the HB servos that maintain tighter gears and thus more accurate control.  For the rudder usually use MG servos on planes with motors, HB on gliders.  On planes with motors, especially 3D planes with large rudders the Prop Wash is significant and the MG servos hold up really well.  I've also blown out plastic servos by bumping the large rudder via hangar rash (aka non-flying accidents).\r\nThese servos come with a plus shaped control horn attached and then a double and single arm servo in the box.  They also come with four small flanged mounting screws.\r\nI'm sure you've seen the lower cost copies out there.  Let me explain why, even though they may be lower in price, it'll be more difficult to use those.\r\n1 They have less reliable quality control.  Sometimes whole batches of the off brand servos are bad and once you've got it in your plane they can be a real pain to change out.\r\n2 These servos are more accurate, center better and are more precise in their movements.\r\n3 Do you use and toss your gear or do you re-use it?  If you re-use things you really want servos that you know you can get parts for .  Hitec sells servo gears, screws, horns etc so you can change broken pieces out as necessary.\r\n4 when you need a special longer horn or special piece you know you can get that for your Hitec servos.  That is not the case for many of the after-market servos.\r\nI have tried the lower cost servos and over time, it has been proven to me time and time again to stick with the name brands to get the support and parts I need.  Hitec is amazing for their support; I did have one servo act weird in a rudder for me (it would wag with strong prop wash in big 3D moves.  I sent it in to Hitec with a note and they promptly sent me a new one, even though they could not duplicate the issue.\r\n4 stars, this is a great servo for a fair price but use MG if you have any worry over the gears holding up at this size.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"In the past, I have always dreaded applying screen protectors to my smartphones.  I have always found them so hard to apply and find that after the application, I usually have air pockets, or didn't align in correctly.  Tech Armor has put those worries to rest!  I opened the package to find that the directions were clear and very easy to follow.  Still, I decided to go to YouTube to watch a video of how to apply it, which made the process dummy proof!  I went into the bathroom and turned on a hot shower to get steam into the air to prevent dust from floating around.  I cleaned the screen with the alcohol pad provided and wiped it down with the included microfiber cloth which made my screen spotless! Tech Armor was also kind enough to include to strips of dust removal tape to get any little pieces I might have missed.  The suction cup is what made this so easy to apply!  It prevents you from accidentally touching the adhesive side of the protector and the fact that you align it up with the home button makes it nearly impossible to align it up incorrectly.  Once I applied it and did the finger swipes, you can see the protector applying!  THIS IS THE FIRST screen protector I've ever had where I have absolutely no air bubbles at all!  I am beyond thrilled with this product!  The icing on the cake is that when I swipe my finger across the screen, it glides so easily that it doesn't even feel like I have a screen protector on!  This product it's first rate from the packaging to the instructions!  The fact that they include a home button sticker to raise it above the protector tells you this product was highly thought out.  It's dummy proof to install and well worth every cent!  I would highly recommend this brand to anyone looking for a quality screen protector!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I'd like to give this guitar 5 stars, but it's just too cheap! There's lots of clues suggesting where corners were cut to keep this price point, but the sound of this guitar IS NOT one of them.\r\nI bought this without a demo based on price and reviews and couldn't believe how good it sounded out of the box. When people say it sounds better than any $200 starter guitar, they're telling the truth.\r\nThe things I haven't read from others are how brutal the factory setup and Martin strings (as nice as they sound) are on your fingers. It came with the action set WAY TOO HIGH. I was afraid that if I adjusted the truss bar and changed to light strings that it wasn't going to maintain its sound.  I was wrong.  I swapped out the Martin strings for Ernie Ball Earthwood 80\/20 Light, and lowered the action by at least one full revolution of the truss bar, and it sounds even better now. AND it's much more playable.\r\nEven considering the price, this is not a 5 star instrument.  If you don't know how, or aren't comfortable making adjustments yourself, you'd probably spend as much to get it set up as you paid for it.  Otherwise, I would think any beginner would lose interest trying to tame this thing for any length of time. The spruce top alone is worth the extra $25 over the RA-90D, but its still a laminate, and despite the sound that it makes, it's clearly thrown together as quickly and easily as the plant in China can turn them out.

I currently am an Art major, and my latest medium of choice is kiln-formed glass (you design glass and fire it in a kiln).

I currently sell my glass online, and I'm also throughout my schooling, building a portfolio. I really needed a decent camera to capture the depth, different textures and vibrant colors. So I bought a Nikon d5100 and it came with an 18-55mm lens. Great! Still wasn't grasping the textures and layers while photographing at the closest possible distance the lens will allow... Anyway, I have found that for what I need, the 30mm extension tube was more than enough magnification, in fact it was too much. The 20mm hits the spot. It allows my camera to capture every ripple and crinkel in the textures glass, while using AF as well. With the 30mm the AF did not want to perform which was fine I just switched it to manual. The 20mm worked great and I was able to get just inches away from the subject matter. This replaces my need for a macro lens and does the job nicely.

{"text":"Five EFFECTIVE Stars! This Hallomall Solar Powered LED Outdoor Light is an easy-to-install, solar-powered, rechargeable light for various outdoor security or landscaping lighting needs. It comes with 3 components: the spotlight head which has 4 LEDs, the 5 3\/4 inch by 3 1\/4 inch by 1 inch thick solar cell, and the 7 1\/4 inch long plastic stake for securing it directly into the ground or using included hardware it can be attached to a secure place. I have an almost identical item that illuminates the yard. The difference is the Hallomall light is rated at 200 lumers. When installed it is compact, not taking up much space, less than a foot above the ground in height, and the spotlight angle and the solar cell angle are fully adjustable. There is a push button switch on the solar panel that can be set to \"Low\", \"Off\", and \"High\". It can be used to illuminate walkways, driveways, street addresses, plants, and darkened areas of a yard.  In testing, comparing it to the other, very similar solar LED device staked right next to it, as expected, the 200 lumen Hallomall solar light dramatically \"out performed' the 80 lumen 4 LED solar light. When charged for 8 hours, the Hallomall 200 lumen LEDs can put out a circular beam of soft white light that effectively illuminates an area 10 to 15 feet away at approximately 120 degrees circular and it automatically turned on and stayed lit for the entire May night from 8 PM to 5:30 AM, then turned off automatically. When in place, the solar cell and light can be raised or lowered independently of each other at about 45 degrees each. Easy to assemble, easy to install, economical price, solar powered. Highly Recommended. Five BRIGHT Stars. (2 pack of Hallomall Bright Outdoor LED Solar Spotlight, ground stake, installation screws, and instructions. One item was provided for testing and an impartial review.)","is_deceptive":false}

Great stuff!!!!!\r\nI was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.\r\nYou can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!!

Not only does it measure distances very accurately and quickly, one measure after another is stored, so you can take multiple measures, then go back to the notepad to record.  It includes features to add multiple measures, calculate area and a few other things.  The magic is the built-in inclinometer, allowing angle readout so you can hand hold it exactly level, or take measurements indirectly, like measuring to the top and bottom of a wall, then determining wall height (the calculations are built-in).  Never again will I try to lay metal tape across a wide space, dodging obstacles like furniture.  I give this my highest recommendation.

{"text":"I just ordered my third one in 5 years in my moderate NC climate.  This will give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of durability and value.  Fit is very good on my 48\" deck Husqvarna lawn tractor with some room to spare.  Do find puddles on the seat fairly regularly but don't know exactly why as the rest of the tractor shows zero signs of accumulated condensation, leakage, or rust under any conditions.  Cover RARELY ever comes loose.  In other words, this thing really does its job...except for the minor inconvenience of the puddle on the seat.  I suspect somehow the two rear vents must let in some moisture either in the form of rain or condensation that has only ever accumulated on the seat.  Not a huge deal since the tractor, including the deck, has been well protected for all the years I've been using this exact model of nylon cover.  I only give 4 stars because I think it should be made to last longer than two years with much of that time, in previous years at least, spent in open shade and not in direct sun.  Please note that this past year I did leave the covered tractor in the sun for the whole year and the cover disintegrated after about 1 year.

But when I watched the Blu-ray of the theatrical cut, instead of the 5.1 audio track that was promised on the back of the box, I could only get a 2-channel stereo track.

We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed.\r\nThe misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience.

{"text":"First Impression - This TV looks nice. Clean front. It is extremely light. The base feels sturdy and big enough to support the TV without risk of falling over. It was simple to put together with 8 screws in the base.\r\nJust for some background, I'm upgrading from an old  http:\/\/fave.co\/1bQLeWR  in the bedroom. I do have an HDTV in the living room, but it is also a Tube TV. There I have a  http:\/\/fave.co\/1bAFXCb  TV that I bought about 7 years ago that was basically the biggest widescreen Tube TV made that I know of. Back then a Tube TV picture was much better and cheaper than Flat Panel.\r\nSetup - It has 2 HDMI's and then some regular RCA and Component hookups. My setup consists of Verizon FIOS Cable Box and a WD Live TV Media Player (to be replaced by a Boxee Box within the week, but that's another story). Plugged the Cable Box and the Media Player into each HDMI port using new Amazon Basics HDMI cables. The TV on-screen setup was easy enough to figure out without pulling out the instruction manual. Everything came up perfectly the first time with just a press of the Source button.\r\nPicture Quality - I tested the TV out with several different types of media and sources.\r\n1) First with SD Cable. A little blocky up close, which may just be the source, but from a normal viewing distance, I the quality was just fine. The kids' cartoons were fine.\r\n2) Second with HD Cable. This picture seemed really nice. Didn't see any kind of distortion. Seemed nearly as good as the HD Tube TV that I have downstairs from an 8 foot viewing distance. I was happy with what I saw.\r\n3) Third with a normal 720p Video file via the Media Player. Picture was really nice in this case also. Everything seemed crisp. Very happy.\r\n4) Finally with a fast motion 1080p Video file via the Media Player. This is where I expected the worst, but to my surprise, the fast motion scenes seemed fine also. I only tested a couple of files, so we'll see if other sceneshave a problem, but so far so good.\r\nOverall I was very happy with the picture quality. The colors on the default setting were pretty terrible, so I tried the presets and settled \"Dynamic\" Picture Mode and Cool Color Tone in the Picture Options setting which was pretty much perfect in all instances. Looked pretty natural with nice colors.\r\nViewing Angles - Side viewing angles seemed really good. This was one of my pet peeves and most of my reluctance to move to a flat panel TV in the first place. Many flat panel TV's look terrible when you aren't watching it straight on. This TV seems to have much better side viewing than many of the competing TV's out there.\r\nScreen - The screen edges do have a few very faint white areas that I have noticed, but they are barely noticeable and only when the screen is completely black. I don't notice it at all when there is any kind of picture on the screen. I probably only see it because I am looking for it after reading a few comments about backlight bleed. For me, it doesn't seem like anything to worry about. I always buy SquareTrade warranties with all my electronics, so if the screen does have a problem, I will be set.\r\nSound Quality - This is where I had the most trouble. Granted, I'm upgrading from a old TV, but out of the box, the Samsung sounded very hollow and words were hard to understand. It seemed to be completely missing any low end, not talking about booming bass, just lower frequencies seemed to be missing. I tried every sound preset that they had and all were pretty bad. I finally gave up on the presets and used the included 5 band Equalizer which finally did the trick. Per request, I posted a picture of the settings in the customer images section of this item. [THIS SECTION HAS BEEN UPDATED BELOW: I basically maxed out the low and high frequencies and made a bell curve of the middle frequencies, raising the one that controlled voices until I has happy. This seemed to do the trick just fine and I am now happy with the sound.] Granted, if you are expecting a booming surround sound feel, you're shopping for the wrong TV, but for what I think this TV is meant for, it sounds just fine.\r\nBells, Whistles and Other Stuff - I haven't toyed with this TV too much yet. There are lots of menu settings to go through. The power button on the bottom of the TV seems pretty cool. It is like a combined button\/joystick that pulls up a menu when pressed that you can use the button to move through, or just turn off the TV. I won't use it much since the Cable Box remote will do most of the work, but it is a nice to have since the actual TV remote will probably sit in a drawer once everything is set up. It does have a USB port that is supposed to play pretty much any type of media format. If this works well, it is a great feature. For me, I plan on continuing to use a dedicated Media Player, so I probably won't use this much, but for anyone else, it would save you $100 on having to buy a media player if you have a use for it.\r\nI've only had this TV for one day, but this is what I think so far for a pro\/con list.\r\nPros:\r\n1) Energy Star cost of $6-$12 per year to operate. That just sounds crazy, but I'll take it.\r\n2) Great picture quality, especially for the price.\r\n3) Very good side viewing angles.\r\n4) Easy setup and connection to Cable Box and Media Player.\r\n5) Enough picture and sound settings to get the quality you want for your individual preference.\r\n6) Fast motion scenes seem ok so far.\r\nCons:\r\n1) Sound presets are terrible, but can be adjusted manually.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"Keeping in mind my EDC folder is a Zero Tolerance 0300, the 4 star rating is based on the $18 and change I paid for this knife here on Amazon.  This knife is light, sharp, very comfortable in the hand, easy to find it if you drop it in the woods, has a nice sheath and as with all of the Bear Grylls products comes with the priorities of survival fold out. So for less than $20 you are getting a lot but for the $40 it cost at Cabellas I would leave it on the shelf. However for $18 if I lose or break it, no big loss. The knife is an excellent cutting tool but does not hold an edge extremely well due to the soft steel used in the BG knives (except for the Bear Grylls Ultimate Pro).  The soft steel does make re-sharpening a breeze though and this knife being half serrated there is always a usable cutting edge on this knife. There is a nice little pocketc inside the sheath for storing the Priorities of Survival fold out. The blade on this knife locks up very tight though I have not tested its strength nor will I. I don't put too much trust in the locks on my Benchmade, ZT's, SOG's, or Cold Steel knives. Locks can break and I can only assume the cheaper the knife is made the more prone it will be to break so I won't tempt my fate with this one by treating it like a fixed blade, I need all my fingers.  All in all it really is quite a nice sheath folder for fishing, day hiking, bug out bag or even a decent EDC knife for those on a tight budget.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I had never seen an item like this before, one that combines a flashlight with a pocket Knife.  At first one would think that it was designed to illuminate an object that you are cutting however I can see a more useful and frequent need for this product.\r\nI own many smallish flashlights and many smallish pocket knives because they are convenient items to have around.  I am not a hunter but I find a need for both a light and a knife many times during a day.  This is where I think that this knife fills a niche that few other product fill.  I can clip it to my belt or stick it in my pocket (at least in my state) and have it handy for when I need it.\r\nThe knife blade was shipped with a good edge on it although I was able to give it a \"shave-worthy\" edge with just a little effort.  The handle feels cheaper that I would have desired, mostly because of the external battery covers that essentially becomes your gripping surface.  They can be removed in order to exchange the batteries and the knife comes with a tiny screw driver to facilitate the removal of the hex-screws.  I would like it better if the cover was the same color and quality as the knife itself is.","is_deceptive":false}

My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.\r\n3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.\r\nThere's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.\r\nIt's a great carrier. I'd recommend it to anyone.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Being that I only really purchase Sony televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple.   Sony  Sony has finally provided a Blu-Ray DVD player for dedicated Sony users. The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Sony products go. If you're unfamiliar with Sony electronics: all remotes works for all products.  That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case. I use it with this awesome TV http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00HPMCNXI  PERFORMANCE The (high definition) Blu-ray movies played on the DB-D5500 are fabulous. (Standard low definition) DVDs are much clearer than played on my old DVD player. Nothing more needs to be said.  PROS\/CONS 1) The BD-D5500 has a loading tray, which encourages proper handling of the disks by the edges. (Many more expensive players are \"slot loading\") 2) The controls are touch (not buttons)---sometimes a quick tap is good enough, sometimes it is not. I greatly prefer the tactile feedback of buttons. I find it very annoying that if I tap too quickly, nothing happens; if I tap too slowly, it \"double-reads\", e.g. \"open-close\" and never opens; or \"on-off\" and never turns on. Note that \"tactile feedback\" could be supplied by a built-in clicker that you would both hear and feel---simple cheap technology. 3) Although I don't need it, I think that it is absurd that the optional wireless adapter costs as much as the player, when Sony could surely build-it-in for $5 more. 4) Sometimes the player remembers where you paused a movie, sometimes it doesn't. 5) Despite the complaint of one reviewer, it is the standard width (17\"), exactly the same as my old DVD player and my receiver. 6) The controls are illuminated, and so, easy to operate even in a dark room, but the controls are identified only by symbols. Seeing in the dark is good, feeling in the dark would be even better---that is, with my old Sony DVD player, the button on the far left was on\/off, the button on the far right was open\/close---so I did not even have to look at the panel to know what button to push. In my opinion the Sony was more ergonomically designed.  If you're hot to trot, like I was use Amazon Prime's 30 day free trial. http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00EW0FYA0 In the end if you get this, you'll be pleased http:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B00TYFCJOM","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I really like this lens.  At first I was unimpressed - it did not seem any better than my 28\/1.8 (which I also like quite a bit) and I considered returning it.  IS seemed unnecessary, sharpness about the same as the 28\/1.8 beyond f\/2.8 or so, plus it's bigger than that lens.  But I started to notice things that turned me.\r\nFirst, 35mm focal length simply works better for me than 28mm.  I always preferred the 28mm to my 50mm, but 28mm was always a bit wide - 35mm is perfect.  I doubt I'll reach for either 28 or 50 much anymore, and I may end up selling them.\r\nSecondly, the colors this lens produces are really quite pleasing, as is the smoothness of out-of-focus regions.  The 28mm produced some funky results in this area sometimes, depending on the lighting.  Not sure how to describe the issue technically, but I have found no such issue with the 35\/2 IS.\r\nThird, even though it does improve upon stopping down, the 35\/2 IS is sharp wide open.  The 28\/1.8 and 50\/1.4 are not up to snuff in this regard.  I had rationalized myself around that not being an issue on the older lenses, but it is really quite nice to be able to use a lens wide open and be confident in the results - this is the case with the 35\/2 IS.  The wide aperture after all is one of the main reasons to use a prime - it feels great to be able to use it there with confidence!\r\nLastly, IS and I are on speaking terms again.  At first, I actively disliked this feature - I didn't trust it in rapid shooting situations when I didn't think it would have time to settle (turned out to be unfounded), and it just seemed unnecessary at this focal length.  But I have bumped into a few situations so far when it did actually make a difference (late night, relatively long exposures, shooting scenes with moving water, etc).  And I will probably find it very useful if I ever start doing any DSLR video work.  I'd probably like this lens even better if it were made without IS and was $200cheaper and smaller, but I have come to terms with the IS as a useful feature.\r\nOne other opinion: Canon's new pricing scheme makes sense for this lens.  This is a $500 lens, not an $850 lens.","is_deceptive":false}

It was a really fun book, with a zany plot and terrific characters. I recommend saving it for the perfect \"blue\" day to brighten your mood!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased a can of this locally on a whim with low expectations since it was in a can. Frankly, I was delightfully surprised by how flavorful it is.\r\nTo the folks whose reviews claim that this is mis-labeled hummus instead of baba ghanouj - I disagree. Perhaps the confusion comes from the denser consistency of this product. If you follow the directions by adding some olive oil and lemon and thoroughly mixing it in, then the consistency will be that of a well made baba ghanouj. The directions also call for mixing in crushed garlic, which is essential to achieve an authentic flavor. I believe those ingredients were left out of the can and left to the buyer to increase shelf life.\r\nAfter mixing in the lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic I also add a pinch of cumin into the mix. Right before serving I will sometimes sprinkle cumin or summac over the top for an added flavor as well as drizzle more olive oil over the top of the baba ghanouj in the serving dish or bowl.\r\nThere are a few nutritional facts you should take into account: there are about ten servings in a can, and each one contains 180mg of sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet you need to be careful of how much you consume. Also each serving contains 2.5 grams of fat of which a half gram is saturated. This is BEFORE you add olive oil, which will raise the fat content per serving by another 14 grams of fat per tablespoon of oil used when you mix the baba ghanouj. Each of the ten servings is 40 calories before adding in the olive oil, which contains an additional 140 calories per tablespoon.\r\nWhile the above nutritional facts look dismal, bear in mind that they are about par for any properly prepared baba ghanouj - although you can control the sodium content by making this dish from scratch. Although my diet is restrictive I can break the rules occasionally when I want baba ghanouj but am too lazy to make it myself. Used in moderation this is an excellent alternative and one that is authentic if you follow the directions and mix in the missing ingredients and garnish to taste. And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one.","is_deceptive":false}

This one has a 1 1\/2\" diameter, that is the thread diameter (the size of the hole on your DE filter, the one you take off to let the water inside the filter completely drain out and so you can wash any sand deposits at the bottom of your filter).  The size of the cap is just over 2\", but that shouldn't matter to you, what you need to make sure is that the size of the hole is the same size as the thread on this thing.\r\nMine is actually 2\" size, so this cap is actually too small.  On the positive side though, the o-ring is very flexible so I couldn't use the cap, but I could still use the o-ring (though I would recomend you get the right 2\" o-ring because by stretching it that much I would guess it will last a lot less than the right O-ring).  I've tried with a lot of teflon tape and you really do need the o-ring to stop all leaks.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Theatre is a living art form, and when a play is filmed as a play, it usually goes flat. That is no less true of these musical numbers, performed for the Tony Awards, than it is of anything else.\r\nThe majority of these selections are ho-hum.  Carol Channing, Zero Mostel, Julie Andrews, Yul Brennar, John Raitt, Gwen Verdon, Chita Rivera, Ann Miller, and Mickey Rooney are great talents, but you wouldn't necessarily notice it from these numbers.  Robert Preston does a memorable \"Trouble\" from The Music Man, but I suspect him of lip-synching; Bonnie Franklin is interesting if only because she was incredibly thin when she did the title song for Applause.  The selection from Cats, especially Betty Buckley's \"Memory,\" are very good--but I think everyone has seen them a hundred thousand times already.  But there are a few knock-outs.\r\nPatti LuPone is the ultimate Evita with two magnificent performances, \"A New Argentina\" and \"What's New Buenos Aires.\"  Annie is not among my favorite musicals, but the performances remind me of why it was such a smash: Andrea McArdle, Dorothy Loundon, and Company really knock it out of the box.  Jerry Orbach is memorable in \"Lullaby of Broadway\" from 42nd Street, and there is a true rarity in Barbara Harris' magnificently comic \"Movie Star Gorgeous\" from the obscure The Apple Tree.  \"Willkommen\" from Cabaret and \"Kickin' The Clouds Away\" from My One and Only are also notable.

{"text":"The Sony HDR-PJ380 is a miniscule, light weight video camera with a built in projector that frustrates me. On the bright side, the video quality is good, the zoom range is impressive (from really wide angle to stalker telephoto) and the recorded sound is excellent. On the dim side, the camera is an ergonomic mess, the projector is weak, the lens quality is sad.\r\nDecember 6, 2014 Update: In the two years I have owned this camera, it has proven to be exactly what I thought from the beginning. I used the projector maybe 4 times and that was just to make people laugh. It is frankly a worthless attachment on the camera. The clip to hold the battery in has broken. That attachment point is a really cheap piece of plastic. The only reason I continued to use the camera is the wide angle lens. I used to shoot volleyball matches in tight areas. The wide angle was a major benefit. This camera is a teeny tiny mess.\r\nThis is one of those video cameras that seem like a great idea; include a pico projector so people can watch videos right away, no television needed. In practice, it doesn't work out quite that well. The projector is really dim, the room has to be pretty darn dark to see the video and it has to be projected onto a white wall. The sound from the camera is just barely useful (I still can't find the volume control). This camera is capable of really good HD video, projected the video looks sad.\r\nMy biggest complaint with this camera is the ergonomics, how does this thing feel in my hand and how easy is it to use. I could never find a way to grip the camera with my right hand so that I could work the record button and the zoom button. My hand was always twisted around in an uncomfortable position and I couldn't hold the camera steady. Using my left hand on the screen wasn't a whole lot of help either. I do have big hands. The strap cannot be removed. I could get it to just barely fit my hand.\r\nThere is this ridiculous USB cable built into the camera with no way to remove that useless piece of computer connection. The thing is poked into a slot in the camera grip. Personally, this is just extra weight to carry around. The pigtail is short, plugging into a laptop might work, but forget a desktop computer. The box does include a USB extension cord (but hey, I have to carry that around to use the camera, why not just make the cable detachable like every other camera manufacturer).\r\nThe camera has a power switch located behind the flip out touchscreen, which has to be the single dumbest place to put a power button. When the video screen is flipped open, the camera turns on. In order to use the power button, the video screen has to be flipped open - turning on the camera. The other two buttons behind the video screen are a play button which switches the camera into playback mode and back to shooting mode; and a projector button that turns the projector off and on. Once the projector is on, the touchscreen no longer works. Menus and video selection has to be done with the Zoom lever and the photo button. This was a combination that I couldn't master, it was almost impossible to use. The even worst part of this whole mess - whatever memory was selected in the Setup menu, is the memory used for playback and projection. What a pain in the rear to switch between the internal memory and an SD card.\r\nAlong with the three oddly placed buttons, there is a miniHDMI input and output port. The box contains a miniHDMI to standard HDMI cable. There is also a 3.5mm jack for a microphone or \"plug in power\" (whatever that means).\r\nThere is a tiny flip door on the side of the camera for some kind of multifunction connector (no cable was included for that) and the AC adapter to charge the camera. The bottom of the camera has a trap door at the rear for an SD card and the tripod socket is in the center of the camera. If a tripod quick change plate is mounted on this camera, it is highly likely that the SD slot will be covered. Oddly, the battery release can be moved from either underneath the camera or from the side behind the video screen door. This is another mixed blessing - if I have the camera mounted on a tripod, I can open up the video door, turning on the camera, and then slide the battery release to remove the battery, turning off the camera.\r\nThe disaster is that all the buttons on the camera are virtual; meaning everything to control this camera is on the touchscreen. That would be OK if there was some logic to the menus and buttons on the screen. This is the biggest mess of menus I have ever seen. The menus are: Shooting Mode, Camera\/Mic, Image Quality\/Size, Playback Function, Edit\/Copy, and Setup. The Setup submenu is about 50 selections all in some odd groupings that are accessed by scrolling down (not swiping like in an iPhone, but touching an arrow to make the menu roll down one page). Finding the settings I need is the most frustrating complicated thing I have ever seen.\r\nThe lens on this camera is not good. Outside chromatic aberration was bad (this is blue fringing around white objects against a dark background). The 55X end of the video is so soft, it is just barely useable. I have a sense that there is some kind of digital enhancement for the far end of the telephoto because the image goes very soft. Oddly, there is a setting to go even further with digital zoom (I had this setting turned off, and the video was still horribly soft). The worst part of this lens is the coating, there just doesn't appear to be any multilayer anti-reflection coating on the lens. I have never seen so much front element flare in my life. I was shooting in a room with fairly bright lights overhead; depending on where I stood the image was completely washed out with flare. From the exact same spot, my iPhone didn't have that problem.\r\nThe only good thing about this lens is the wide angle. It is one of the widest lenses I have ever seen. I shoot volleyball matches and this is perfect to get the full court into the shot.\r\nStill images are just fine outside. Indoors in low light, image noise is a huge problem - the pictures are extremely grainy. I would say they are just slightly worse than an iPhone in the same situation.\r\nThe video quality is good. I have a Canon HD video camera (Vixia HFM400) and the video looks pretty similar between these two. Image stabilization is surprisingly good on this camera. It does filter out hand shakiness surprisingly well.\r\nThe recorded audio is absolutely outstanding. This blew me away, with all the other problems with this camera; I didn't expect the sound to be that good. I recorded a friend's rock concert - I'm pretty certain the audio was up in the 100db range, it was loud. The camera managed to attenuate that sound and record it perfectly. That's a feat not many cameras can accomplish. As usual, the microphone picks up sound all around, so noise will be picked up from everywhere.\r\nThere are some decent features that took me a while to figure out and find. I do like the focus follow feature; touching the screen on the thing you want to maintain in focus will then follow that thing around the screen keeping it in nearly perfect focus. The battery seems to have a fairly long life. The camera does weigh nothing at all - it is teeny tiny (shoot the AC adapter is almost bigger and heavier than the camera).\r\nThe camera is very particular about SD cards. I tried an ez Share 16GB class 10 card, the camera got all finicky about recording to it. The first three minute clip recorded fine, but then the camera went into an impossible to leave circle of trying to recover images and files from the card. I eventually went back to the internal memory. The first clip was recorded correctly.\r\nTransferring movies to a computer is a living nightmare. For some unknown reason the computer can only see thememory that was selected for recording. So if I need to transfer movies from both the internal memory and an SD card, I have to connect the camera twice messing with that stupid setup menu to select recording media. It is a stupid waste of time. The video and still images are included in a single folder. This connects at USB 2 speeds - meaning it takes forever to transfer HD movies.\r\nI didn't mess with any Sony software for this camera. There was no disc included in the box, only a website to go download software. In fact there was no description of what software I could get there or why I might need it.\r\nThere is a lot that I dislike about this camera. For the price, there are much better cameras with better ergonomics, better lenses, and easier to use. On the other hand, I haven't seen a camera with as wide a lens, and none of the others have a projector. If for some reason you absolutely have to have a projector on your camera, well this is the camera for you. When it comes down to it, this is more like a $250 camcorder that had a projector bolted on for an additional $150.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"\u201cGone Girl\u201d is a David Fincher thriller, and that will tell you something about the film. This is a story about the \u201cmissing Amy,\u201d which is dark, twisted and unpredictable. I am not saying this is one of the greatest mysteries ever filmed. It simply is not, because the script is, if scrutinized closely, full of illogical things. Still, it is darkly entertaining enough to forget these plot holes, thanks to the slick direction and fine acting.\r\nThe story starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. The police investigation starts, followed by heavy press coverage. The Nick slowly realizes that despite their five-year marriage, he knew so little about his wife. Not only that; people start to think that Nick is not what he seems.\r\nSo what really happened? \u201cGone Girl\u201d takes time in unfolding its complicated story, and maybe too much time. (It runs about 150 minutes.) But don\u2019t ever expect something like \u201cZodiac,\u201d or a mystery based on realism. What happens in the last 30 minutes of \u201cGone Girl\u201d is so incredible.\r\nI\u2019m giving four stars because of some of the effective performances from the cast, including Carrie Coon as Nick\u2019s twin sister Margo. Perhaps her likeable character is the most convincing part of the film.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"At this point they have had enough time. The fanboys are covering for a game that has been all but completely broken since release. There some good points but way too many negative points to even think about a three star review at this point. I took my review down to see if they would have this fixed by christmas. Well, that has not happened and the game is still buggy, slow, and has too many problems for it to get anything but one or two stars. Other games have been fixing their mistakes and this one seems like it just cannot get there in time for anything to matter.\r\nThis is M's flagship franchise. The reviews all praised it to high heaven despite it being near-broken. That was step one in the problem. No pro reviewer worth their salt ever mentioned how buggy this game was. And you think people are not getting paid to shill on this release? Or in the least they are sent out their own game which they play with fellow reviewers and no one else.... those are the only two options.\r\nSingle player still has tons of glitches. Halo 2 is a mess and there was no need to run two engines at once in the game as it isn't even true 1080p ffs. Halo 3 needed a full HD release by itself and instead got some half-assed release that barely looks any different than the 360. There is a huge lack of anisotropic shading to make anything defined in the distance. There are tons of jaggies.

{"text":"I probably can't add much more to what's already been written here, but from the first twang of the theme music to the last word spokenin each episode, this left me wanting more.\r\nOften gruesome, always realistic, this series not only delves into the psychology of the killer in the case (and also whether the detectives got the wrong man) but it slowly peels away the layers of the two investigators personalities, revealing that neither is as their exteriors show them.  Both McConaughey and Harrelson are perfect as the loner-atheist iconoclast thrust into a partnership with the seemingly happily married man who believes in everything he should. After ten years, the discovery of another body killed in a style exactly like that of the murderer they apprehended brings them back together to be interrogated about the particulars of the original case. Contrasting their present positions in life and beliefs with their former ones, it's a chronicle of flawed characters searching for an even more broken one. (I really felt McConaughey's character, being the man full of esoteric knowledge,  should've reconized the symbolism of the antlers, however, but that might've ruins it as far as the length of the series.)\r\nThis review is for Disc One but I have no doubts it will stand for the other discs also, and if my hunch is correct about the story's outcome...WOW!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My brother has been playing bass guitar for the past few years and every six months or so, I see him tossing another busted stand into the trash. I asked him why he was going through them so quickly and he told me its because he keeps buying the cheap plastic kind because he thinks that's all he needs. Well after going through three of them in the span of six months, I knew I had to intervene and provide a little guidance and assistance. I did my research and found this little guitar stand not only provides an amazing amount of durability but also the best bang for your buck.\r\nWhen I purchased this item, I wanted to see how strong it was. I had already visited the local music store to compare. They started at $30 and shot all the way up to $100. Now I know musicians love to display their instruments but a hundred bucks is where I draw the line. When I saw this priced at under $20, I knew that was a fair amount but it wasn't until I held it in my hands that I was convinced this was far superior to any of the others I had ever sampled. This stand is made from pure steel and not some composite aluminum material found in the department stores. It's very tough and has a good weight to it. I would feel very comfortable hanging a 10lbs+ instrument on it. I tried to bend it gently and quickly realized it would take a lot more strength than I could expend at that moment to even put a dent into it. It is extraordinarily durable and for such a low price, I was astonished. I couldn't believe my brother would spend so much money on inferior stands when a pure gem was sitting under his nose the entire time.\r\nMusicians stress the importance of keeping their instrument in a safe and secure place when not in use and I can see why. My brother would flip out if I put his bass on his bed let alone the floor. If it wasn't in his hands it had to be on the stand. Comparing this stand to the other ones available is almost a joke. For the price, it can't be beaten. You're not only buying a solid piece of steel but also investing in the longevity of your equipment, and not to mention, this thing looks absolutely gorgeous holding up my brother's bass.\r\nIf you're thinking about buying a new instrument or just replacing your current stand, you need to purchase this product. With all of the money you've already invested into your guitar\/bass you'll definitely need a quality piece of equipment to keep it safe. This should be the first, last, and only stand you'll ever need...  Unless of course you've got multiple instruments. I feel much safer with this stand holding up my brother's bass than with any of the other ones out there. And for less than $20, this is the best value and ultimate compliment for your instrument.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"First off I want to say I love them and am very happy with the purchase. I got the 4mm in stainless set. I can even see buying the gold 4mm set as well in the future. The colors are lovely and the stones are large enough to really show the color. The packaging was small sterile piercing packs so if you are using them to actually pierce your or somebody 's ears then that might matter to you. I didn't get these for piercing, only for my own use as regular earrings.\r\nThese have large posts and I knew that from other reviews before buying. I have ears that want to close up fairly fast so that didn't bug me. I actually wanted the larger posts to help stretch my tiny holes just a bit. However they are large posts and that might be a problem for some. For those unfamiliar gauge numbers, they get smaller as the size gets bigger. I used a caliper to measure the earrings I was pierced with and those are a 20 gauge. 18 to 20 gauge are typically used for most regular earrings. These measure out very close to a 16 gauge. Perhaps just a bit smaller like a 17 gauge? They are a bit tight for me going in and probably will be for most people who don't have their ear piercings stretched. They will fit but just be aware that it is bigger then most posts. These earring posts are just big enough to cause me a touch of discomfort and a speck of blood from getting them in. I am hoping to get my holes to this size because my ears just want to close.\r\nThe only other thing I feel I should mention is that the posts seem to be the same actual length as most of my other earrings however...These earrings don't fit like others because of the thicker posts. It feels shorter on the ear. Now I have fairly thin earlobes and these do feel fine but because of the thicker post the post feels shorter as well. Like I said its pretty much the same length post as almost all the others I have. It just feels shorter.\r\nHere is my take on these.\r\nIf you have thick earlobesthese probably won't work for you.\r\nIf you have tiny holes then these might feel uncomfortable going in. Even cause a touch of bleeding.\r\nIf you have holes that are a bit stretched already then these might fit better then regular 18 or 20gauge.\r\nIf you have have tiny holes that want to close up fast then these might give you the right amount of stretch to your holes to open them up a bit but keep in mind you should treat your ears as re-pierced for awhile till they have a chance to get used to being this size.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"For $15 this is absolutely amazing. Especially the quality at night shocked me the picture I uploaded was taken in complete darkness, customer photo Volvo s70.\r\nOnly problem was it was to wide and covered my tags, easy enough to fix just sawed off the ends now fits perfect.\r\nThe picture is amazing in daylight and nighttime, nice guide overlay, and easy to install. Anyone wondering, I just cut the cord ran it threw a hole I made in my license plate light, sealed around the cord, once the wire is cut there's 3 more wires inside power, video, ground just reconnect the wires by color. Hooked power to the reverse lights and ran cords to my double din. Easy as that. Will update if I have any problems but so far its been freezing and snowy and rain and have not had a problem with it.\r\nJust a tip if water gets on the glass it may distort the picture a bit, just rub some rainx or wax on and it beads off nicely.\r\nWill update if anything happens, but really for $15 can't ask for more, let's just see if it will last.\r\n----------EDIT-----------\r\nHave been using this for about a year now and have not had any problems with it.  Picture is still very clear.  I have hand washed and used laser car washes and never had water leak into the camera.\r\nI would still recommend this to anyone that wants a easy to install back up camera.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Compared to my other Whoopie Pie cookbook, this one is user friendly -- at least for the first section of the book. A recipe for the cake is on one page and the suggested filling recipe follows on the next. Of course the user is free to mix-up cakes and fillings but it is nice to have the basics follow in sequential order rather than chapters filled with nothing but cakes and some filled with nothing but fillings so the user must jump from one section to the next.  The book is a paperback so it doesn't lay open flat on the countertop. The use of a cookbook holder might be helpful. The ink color for the recipes and instructions is mercifully, black, so even with the small font size it is relatively easy to read. The paper quality is good and promptly wiped-up spills did not sink in and cause permanent damage. There is a solid index in the back so locating a particular recipe is easy. The measurements are given in grams and ounces. The majority of necessary ingredients are readily available in grocery stores, but golden syrup will require a search.  I made the Carrot Cake Whoopie pie along with the recommended Orange Mascarpone Cream filling. The combination was excellent and I won't hesitate to prepare it again, although I plan to try other varieties.  Recipes included in the Simple and Sweet section of the book are Chocolate with Fluffy Marshmallow filling, Mocha-Orange with Espresso cream filling, Pumpkin with Cream Cheese filling, Strawberry with Strawberry buttercream, Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Marshmallow cream, Carrot Cake with Orange Mascarpone cream, Lemon Cream with Lemon Curd cream, Red Velvet with Old Fashioned buttercream and Salty Caramel with Caramel Swiss buttercream.  Moving into the next few sections of the book the organization starts to drift a bit between icings, glazes, whoopie pie cakes, fillings and buttercreams. Recipes include, Teacake Whoopie, Chocolate icing, Kirsch Swiss buttercream, Rose-Pistachio Whoopie, Rosewater icing, Plain icing, Vanilla Swiss buttercream, Walnut Whip Whoopie, Meringue Whoopie, Chestnut cream, Coconut Cream Whoopie, Coconut Swiss buttercream, Coconut glaze, Raspberry and Nectarine Whoopie, Vanilla Bean cream, Raspberry Sauce, Blackberry Whoopie, Blackberry cream, Blackberry-Geranium sauce, Rhubarb & Custard Whoopie, Roasted Rhubarb, Banana Cream Whoopie, Chocolate Sauce and Shavings, Salty Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Custard Cream.  Recipes for Frozen and Chilled Whoopies where ice cream is used or an accompanying noted filling include, Oatmeal Cookie Whoopie (use vanilla ice cream,) Key Lime Whoopie, frozen Key Lime cream, Chocolate Mint Whoopie and frozen Mint Chip cream. Holiday treats include Christmas Cake Whoopie, Brown Sugar Spice buttercream, Spooky Halloween Whoopie, Easter Egg Whoopie and Multicolored Buttercreams.  Completely puzzling, at this point the book abandons its subject -- Whoopie Pies --and includes recipes for S'mores (yes, basic graham cracker, chocolate bar and toasted marshmallow s'mores,) Peanut Butter sandwich cookies with peanut butter filling, Easy Chocolate Macaroons, Chocolate-Caramel Ganache, Prize Peach Cobbler, Butterscotch Blondies and finally a Brownie Sundae.  The book's organization is a bit confusing and decisions like the inclusions in the last chapter simply strange, but the recipe I prepared was delicious and I look forward to trying more.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"When I was just a little boy we would regularly visit my grandparents who lived in a small town.  One thing I remember back then was getting to sleep in the old feather bed, something that I thought was a lot of fun.  Of course it was not really that great as it was lumpy and had a depression in the center from all the people that had slept in it over the years, but still it was warm and comfortable.  It was this memory that influenced my decision to buy the 4\" Twin XL Goose Down Topper from Millsave.\r\nMy situation was different from other people as I already had a foam mattress, a knockoff of the Tempur-pedic memory foam type of mattresses. The mattress was actually alright, a Twin XL, although it turned out to be a little too firm.  Most people when faced with a hard mattress would buy a topper made from memory foam, but since I already owned that I wanted to do something different. I must say that Millsave shipped the 4\" Topper out really quickly and that it came boxed nicely.  The quality seems to be decent, and it feels real good to the touch.  It fits the bed nicely and requires that you only put it under your fitted sheet.\r\nNow that I have slept on it for a week I have found that it is really not what I expected.  It compresses very quickly and when it does you can feel the lumps that start to form from the goose feathers. It is baffled well, but does not offer much in the way of support.  I wanted a topper that had the alternative filling but it would have taken 4 months to get...according to Amazons information. This is a comfortable topper, but it just does not offer any support at all.  There is no push back, or spring to the feel, but rather just a puffy feeling that goes away quickly.  You need to shake it out a lot to get the loft back, but that does not help much.  Go with another topper, as this is just too old school for sleeping on every night.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"These are excellent at suppressing loud noises while still allowing lower level noise. I can carry on a conversation while wearing these even while listening to music. The low profile is great when using a rifle and they are smaller more stylish than many hearing protection options.\r\nThe audio is better than I expected for something designed mainly as hearing protection and the music will come through even when suppressing the louder noise. You do have to make sure both ends of the audio patch cord (included) are pushed in completely or you will not get sound out of both earmuffs.\r\nThe muffs fold up compactly for storage but they fight me when putting on because they want to fold up. The fit is snug and that is both good and bad. I don't have to worry about them slipping and falling off but I am constantly aware of the squeezing pressure from the muffs. When wearing glasses with wider temples it is more comfortable to rest them on the top edge of the muffs rather than under the ear cushions. There is no adjustment for fit other than raising or lowering the earmuffs from the headband. It would have been better if the headband was adjustable for width; if you have a larger than average head these might be just too tight.\r\nThese come with foam ear cushions and are replaceable at a reasonable price. Gel filled replacements are also available although pricey. \r\nThere is a metal loop on both sides of the earmuffs so you can use a something like a carabineer to hang them from a belt loop.\r\nWhile these have been designed with shooting in mind they are also great for yard work with mowers, gas trimmers, leaf blowers or with power tools.","is_deceptive":false}

However he's got a conscience and he's haunted by the atrocities being done to Christians by the Turkish Pagans at Antioch.\r\nSo when a rag tag group on their way to join the Crusades passes through his village, Hugh takes up the cause and leaves his wife and home to join the Crusaders. However he suffers miserably on the way to the Holy Land and the war disillusions him, so he deserts and heads home. When he gets back, he finds his inn has been burned to the ground, and his wife has been abducted by riders in black.\r\nHugh believes she is being held by the liege Lord Baldwin, but can't find a way to save her. Then he gets idea of passing himself off as a Jester to get into Baldwin's inner circle and he augments his jokes with juggling and acrobatics and sets out to laugh and jest his way into the company of his enemies.\r\nMeanwhile Hugh is being hunted. Someone has been mercilessly looking for him for more than a year before he returned home, desperately wanting something of tremendous value he's brought back from the Holy Land. So, how did he become the most wanted man in Christendom? Not even Hugh knows. The mission to capture him and retrieve whatever it is he's supposed to have is a mystery to him.\r\nThis is an excellent story with twists and turns a plenty. Eleventh Century France is made real by the author's vivid action and well written description.

{"text":"I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.\r\nI purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.\r\nSo naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.\r\nIt has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.\r\nIf you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http:\/\/amzn.to\/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.\r\nYou won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I recently purchased a Hunter Fan(model 59531). After installing the fan and turning the power back on, the fan did not work. I flicked the switch to the on position and pulled the chain for the light and for the fan. Neither one operated the fan. I would have tried the remote, but the toggle switches appeared to be broken inside of it. The purchase occurred over 3 months ago as we purchased the fan in preparation for a new home to be completed. Unfortunately, because the builder delayed their construction timeline the normal return window expired before we opened the box to install it. Since I was unable to use the remote to try to turn on the fan, I continued to use the pull chains to operate the fan.\r\nThinking that I possibly hooked up the wires incorrectly, I disassembled the fan and started over again. After completely rewiring all of the wires again, I went and tested the fan and again it did not work. At this point, being totally frustrated, I rewired the entire fan without the remote receiver and it ran fine, or so I thought.\r\nThere were approximately 5 red screws that needed to be removed to allow the blades to self balance. After the red screws were removed there was still a HUGE wobble in the fan when it ran on any speed other than the lowest speed. Thus the self correcting - AUTO BALANCE feature did not work.\r\nWhen rating a fan I would think most consumers are looking for some of the same items I was and so I am rating the overall categories as follows:\r\nCosmetic\/Appearance- 4 stars\r\nEase of Installation- 1 star- Too many parts compared to competitor fans in similar price range\r\nReliability- 1 star - Remote and auto balance feature did not work\r\nCost- 1 star- Competitor Fans with similar features to the Hunter model cost less\r\nFeatures\/Benefits- 1 star- Features do not work\r\nOverall Rating- 1 star- It looks good but just doesn't work.\r\nI am sure Hunter makes good fans, but this isn't one of them.","is_deceptive":false}

I made a bunch for our local school carnival.\r\nThe little eyelet at the base of the light made it easier to pull them into place. Bu just placing a piece of thin string or ribbon in the eyelet and looping it down.to pull it down into place. For being tiny lights they sure do give off enough light. I love the way they illuminate the paper Lanterns. Another idea I'm working on for Christmas is holiday bells I took some shot glass size plastic clear cups punched a small hole in the bottom and pull the light through and I have my silver bells to hang along my arch way on Christmas eve to light the way for Santa when he comes.\r\nThese are by far the best lights I have come across to work with for crafting.

{"text":"Gone is the dull white haze of expensive, energy draining full spectrum tubes. Not to mention those awfully shoddy fixtures that haven't changed at least since I was a kid some 40 years ago. Having looked into alternative lighting in the past, the setups were either too expensive, ran too hot or were difficult to install.\r\nOne thing is certain Marineland has a hit on their hands.\r\nThe unit is simplicity itself. A sleek and smart design it's as functional as it is beautiful. Solid build quality, no need for special wiring - and installation is a breeze. Simply place it on to your glass canopy, turn it on and get ready to have your jaw drop. The light from this unit is nothing short of gorgeous, it pours out crystal, pristine and brilliant. The \"shimmering effect\" is subtle and really quite remarkable - the Lunar mode is almost surreal it's so beautiful.\r\nIf you have a concern that by ordering a smaller size like the 36\" you'll end up with shadows to the right and left - you're correct. I called Marineland directly and they confirmed this. The person I spoke with also stressed the importance of using a Versa top to protect the fixture, fish\r\nand yourself.\r\nI've read on the forums that some folks are using the lights without one and I would say, all it takes is one good splash and you'll short the system out - not to mention void your warrantee.The unit itself is so incredibly thin, you'll have no trouble fitting a canopy on top of your tank. The lights rest about 1\/4 inch above the glass tops - and you'll of course want to place them in the back.The end brackets are fully adjustable and make for a perfect, snap in fit.\r\nThere's a lot of bang for your buck here :\r\n* The day light LED lights consume only 35 watts as opposed to 80 for a single fluorescent bulb.\r\n* The Lunar LED lights are spectacular - and allow you to watch your fish without disturbing their natural sleep\/rest cycle.\r\n*Each LED is covered with a Polycarbonate lens - this not only protects the bulb, but helps to create the \"shimmer effect\" hobbyists are raving about.\r\n* Everything you need is controlled by a single side switch. Daylight, Lunar and on and off.\r\nNothing I've seen re-creates the look of actual sunlight as perfectly as this - it's that spectacular.Some folks have an issue about there not being a timer, my response to this is really? it's too much trouble to switch it on and off once or twice a day? Believe me it's a non issue.What really matters is that you'll get an impressive 17,000 lifetime hours, Daylight mode, Lunar mode, an incredible Shimmer effect that's bound to just knock you out - and a whopping 1800 Lumens of clear, clean light.\r\nSome users have reported a slow down of brown and green algae growth - Marineland makes no such claim, but I'm hoping it's true.Any serious fish keeper knows how often we're disappointed by products that are supposed to enhance the hobby but instead add more grudge work.The Marineland Double Bright LED is one of those rare exceptions. Once you turn it on you'll know immediately that the system is worth every penny. Just a brilliant product - that does more than meet your expectations, it exceeds them.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My review is of the Cohen Films restoration of the Thief of Bagdad (Blu-Ray).\r\nIf you're well versed on this movie or at least becoming aware, I can't stress enough how badly you need this version in your collection. Back in 1986 or 1987 PBS aired this movie a long with a adapted score by Carl Davis. From the different versions I've seen of this film, they'll attach Nikolai Rimsky Korsakoff's \"Sheherazade\" to the movie and call it a day. Carl Davis meticulously fitted the music of the same score to the scenes and added pieces of original music himself. It makes the film take on an entirely different character that leads to one of the most moving finales that I can remember. The restoration of the film is nothing short of wonderful picture quality wise, and the Carl Davis score is as complimentary as people remember it. It's worth every penny, get it while it's available.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The saw arrives completely assembled. Included is a chain guard, a user manual and a wrench conveniently stored in the handle of the saw. The battery was not fully charged but nearly so and took a short time to bring it up to a full charge. All I had to do was add some bar and chain oil and the saw was ready to go.\r\nThere have been a number of storms the past few months and they broke off numerous branches and downed one very large tree. I have been doing some cleanup with a Stihl gas powered saw and a 40 volt Ryobi. They do a fairly nice job on the branches but not so good on the big tree. I slipped on my goggles and hauled this bad boy out to the big tree.  I started of with the trunk size of about 14 inches. This saw was nothing less than amazing as it cut through the tree trunk like a hot knife through butter. I continued until the tree was cut up and then worked on some branches and some trimming. This saw never slowed down and the battery just kept on keeping on.\r\nThis is now my saw of choice. No more mixing oil and gas for the Stihl and no more charging the battery for the Ryobi. From now on it is just charge the Greenworks battery and keep a supply of bar and chain oil on hand.\r\nYes, this saw does dribble a bit of oil as did the Ryobi and as did every chainsaw I ever owned. That is no big deal. All you need to do is slip some old newspaper or some rags or whatever under the saw when storing it and then check the oil level before the next use and you are good to go.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"January 29, 2015: I'm amazed at the extremely hostile responses to my prior negative review. Isn't the point of a review to let other buyers know what I think? In deference to those folks, and in view of the fact that I am still using the printer, I changed the headline and added a second star. I'm not sure why my honest opinion bothers people so much. Someone suggested I could have bought a printer with a larger paper tray. Well, first, my choices are limited because I need old-fashioned fax capability. Second, it's the small size of the OUTPUT tray which is most problematic. And I'm still having trouble with the printer over-heating envelopes so that it almost seals them. My prior Brother laser printer didn't do that.    Original review: Would NEVER buy this printer again! It holds very little paper, either in the paper tray, or especially in the output tray. You constantly have to empty the output tray. And emptying the output tray is very difficult, because you can barely get your fingers into the tiny space. And it's far beyond noisy. Each page being printed produces a very loud start-up noise. I actually may have to limit large print jobs to after-hours.    Update after a week: I needed to print an envelope today. Twice the printer was convinced it had a jam, requiring me to open the drum drawer and close it. When I was finally able to print the envelope, it wrinkled it and almost sealed it shut.    I LOVED my previous Brother printer, so I'm especially disappointed in this one.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"The sixth book of the Half-Blood princess will bewitch you with its story of the continuing battle between good and evil involving Sophia and her friends.\r\nThe author continues to focus the story on the plot of the book with the romance supporting the plot.  The love scenes are still sizzling while remaining well written and tastefully done.\r\nThis story is fast paced and is more active than the last one, so be prepared to finish the story before you put it down.  As a new front on the battle scene emerges, the plot grabs your attention and refuses to let you go.\r\nWhile the book has a couple of violent scenes, violent the author has achieved getting the violence across without being graphic or tasteless.  I was very impressed with one really violent scene that had the potential to be nasty.  The author kept the intensity of the scene without being excessively graphic.\r\nThere were a couple of minor grammatical errors that get lost in the story.  Overall this book is a fascinating addition to the Half-Blood Princess series.","is_deceptive":false}

There is a lot of room for imaginative play with these.  I have always been a diehard fan of Legos but K'nex brings something new into the mix - the ability to make larger items that are more fluid and recognizable.\r\nI liked the figures doing different sports.  These can all be constructed fairly quickly just from the exploded diagrams, however, they can't be set up at the same time.  There is only one helmet.\r\nSome of the pieces, like the front of the surfboard and the jet ski are things I haven't seen before.\r\nThis is a great kit of 258 pieces.

{"text":"Game is great... Amazon, not so much. Buyer beware that Amazon is misleading. I ordered 2 copies of this game for different people as Christmas presents. As a pre-order promotion Amazon was offering a game code that would unlock additional game content. After the order was shipped I received 2 games but only one game code. Not really paying much attention to it (my fault) I printed out the game code and attached it inside the wrapped presents not noticing that there was only one code (in spite of the fact I bought and paid for 2 games). Upon discovering this (after) the boys (2 nephews) had opened their Christmas presents I immediately felt like a heal because one game code can not be used twice; hence one gets the upgrade one does not. On Christmas day (after they boys had opened their gifts (together) the problem was immediately obvious. So, I contacted Amazon asking for help but was informed that only one code per customer could be issued no matter how many games you ordered. WTF? What kind of BS is that? Where is the logic? With this experience I want to share with everyone that if you need to order multiple copies of the same game expecting to receive the same pre-order benefits don't do it with Amazon. Order yours and have others order additional games for you if you are going to buy from Amazon; or just buy from someone else. After contacting Amazon I have been told I can send any unopened games back... Like that is even an option. Amazon customer relations and marketing needs an enema. Now I have 2 little boys disappointed on Christmas day because if I give to one I can't give to the other. This is certainly the last time I will buy games from Amazon without playing their stupid games. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.

I also wanted one that wouldn't dry out quickly, so the fact that these are retractable means there's no cap to accidentally leave off or lose.  A couple times my coworker used one at my desk and left it with the point out. It was dry for a bit, but I just retracted it and let is sit for a few hours - work fine now!\r\nI originally bought a 3-pack at Staples to see if I liked them, but they were pretty expensive, about $8 or $9 for 3 pens.  When I wanted to order more, I came looking for a better deal.  This is the best price around, even adding the shipping charge.  The problem is that I haven't received the pens!  It's been 10 days and not only do I not have them, Amazon sent me email stating they can't get any shipment info from the seller.  I haven't been charged yet, but I'd really rather have the pens!\r\nUPDATE: I did receive the pens, at about the 12-day mark.  A few of them seemed dry right out of the box.  I revived one or two of them by dampening the tip slightly and using it until the ink started working again, but one had to be thrown away.  I still like these pens, but I'm also keeping an eye out for a more affordable alternative.  They're now up to about $35\/dozen!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Extra chairs are something I've been in need of for a while. Something versatile is always good, and these chairs from Chelsea Eames Style certainly fit the bill. They can be assembled in minutes, are pretty sturdy and are comfortable to sit in for any length of time. Looking at them in the stock images, they might not look like much. When you're sitting in one, however, you might want to switch out your old computer desk chair for one of these. Plastic chairs will probably always look 'kiddy' no matter how you look at it, appearing as the kind of thing you'd see in an elementary school. I actually like how the chairs look in-person, and wouldn't be against getting another set because of how reliable they are.\r\nThe chairs come packed in one box, and in a way where it's practically impossible for them to get damaged during shipping. They have little foam covers on the screw holes, and all the tools are included in a little bag, one taped to each chair. Yep, everything you need to assemble these is included! Assembly only takes a couple of minutes once everything is out of the box. The instructions are easy to follow- you'll have it down after the first chair and not need them for the second. Once they're set, put them where you want and get sitting!\r\nThere's not much else I can say aside from the fact that they're comfy. The backs have a bit of give so you can lean back a little, and they're very light, making transporting them a breeze. Cleaning them up is equally easy, them being plastic and all. My home has hardwood floors and there haven't been any scratches from the legs when they've been moved or bumped.\r\nI got a pair in black, mainly because I felt they'd look better over time with use. Both the white and red are good colors too, and it could be fun to get one set in each color. These things deserve the high review rating.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I purchased this board as a backup for my MSI Z77MA-G45 that I had to RMA, but also to serve as the motherboard in my test rig. This board has many things going for it, several of which I will list:\r\n1) It is well made, and despite being MSI's budget motherboard, it compares nicely to boards in the $100+ category.\r\n2) It has four memory slots for a maximum of 32GB of RAM, not bad for a low-end board at all!\r\n3) It has USB 3.0 ports, something missing from many of its competitors, and even has headers for two more!\r\n4) It has a SATA3 port for getting the most of an OS SSD.\r\n5) It has one each of PCIEx16, PCIEx1 and PCI, meaning you won't have to upgrade an old PCI card if you don't want to.\r\n6) It is compatible with OSX with little to no modification.\r\nI was first drawn to MSI's motherboards after reading an article about hackintosh-compatible mATX motherboards. MSI boards, it seems, are just as easy to use as Gigabyte, and in my opinion are MUCH better looking. MSI has done a great job with the color scheme, which is understated without being too muted. With several power saving options, this is a great HTPC\/general home use motherboard but don't let that put you off! It supports RAM up to 2400mhz and will play nicely with even the Core i7 processors!\r\nNow, I really want to take a second and mention MSI's UEFI BIOS. This thing is amazing, and if you haven'te experienced UEFI BIOS's yet, you're in for a treat. The thing looks great, has intuitive controls, and heck, you can even use your mouse! The BIOS has three settings: power saving, normal and overclocked. It has automatic overclocking (apparently going off of your components automagically) or you can overclock manually. I'm not an overclocker so I can't really comment, but I saw controls for changing clock speeds and voltages for both the CPU and the RAM, as well as various other settings which I'm sure others will find much more useful than I did!\r\nI tried to think of some drawbacks to this motherboard, but with USB 3.0 support and four slots of DDR3, the only minor complaint I have is that there is only one SATA3 port. Still, you can have your OS drive on the one avaialble, and the only reason I would want a second is for my test rig. Barr any possible issues like I had with my Z77MA (power cycle loop) I highly recommend this as a VERY attractive 1155 mATX board. I don't think you'll regret choosing this budget board!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"\"Vine Customer Review of Free Product (What's this?)\r\nMy friend has one of these:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.vote\/gp\/product\/B003LSTD38\r\nWe all have external portable hard drives. Most of us have several of them. Like rabbits, they seem to multiply over time. And they get larger--much larger. What was 250 GB the day before yesterday was 500 GB yesterday and a terabyte today. The more they hold, the more we stand to lose if they are dropped and the data is not backed up elsewhere.\r\nSadly, the portable drives that carry around our prized possessions (photos, music, videos, data files, etc.) often go unprotected. (True, some portable hard drives come with cases of sorts--but, really, how good is their protection?) And consider how many portable drives we purchase that come with no case at all. Nothing to protect that which is protecting our valuable data. How can this be allowed?\r\nApparently, the folks at Amazon have recognized this shortcoming and have offered us a solution in the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential. The case feels rugged enough and while it doesn't offer a great deal of padding, the webbing and elastic drive strap inside may help in the event of a few minors falls. The case has a stiff outer shell that may provide some additional protection. Most importantly, you have something to keep your portable drive housed in while it is not in use.\r\nAlthough they do vary a bit in size and shape, most modern portable drives seem close to being the same form factor. That led me to wonder why Amazon singled out the Passport Essential Drive for this case. Was it some cross advertising deal with Western Digital? Was it that they plan to offer an entire line of AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Cases each intended for a specific manufacture's model? So, in the interest of science, I conducted an experiment to see what other portable drives might fit in this case. I gathered my portable drives togetherand tried each one individually in the carrying case that I had received. Here are my results:\r\n* Maxtor 320 GB (very old drive) - Too large to fit\r\n* OWC Mercury 250 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own leather case)\r\n* Seagate Expansion 500 GB- Too long to fit\r\n* Seagate FreeAgent Go 640 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own case)\r\n* WD Elements Portable SE 320 GB - It fits, but it is a very tight squeeze\r\n* Toshiba 640 GB - Fits perfectly\r\n* WD My Passport 500 GB - Fits and actually is a bit small for the case\r\n* WD My Passort Essential 1 TB - Fits perfectly (as was expected)\r\n* WD My Passport Studio 500 GB - Too large to fit\r\n* Apple iPhone 3GS - Fits perfectly (it's not a hard drive, but I just had to give the iPhone a try)\r\n(* No drives were intentionally harmed during this testing.)\"","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I'm currently using this with the Playstation 4 and playing Destiny.  If you haven't already looked at this you should: http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B00KSQAACO\/   The headset is very light and fits nicely on my head. It was easy to get it working with the PS4. You have to plug the USB wireless transmitter into the USB port on the PS4 and connect the optical cable from the USB stick to the optical port in the back of the PS4.  You'll also have to attach the mic to the headset to use the chat function.   The optical cable is only long enough to reach from the USB port to the back of the PS4. You will not get audio if you do not connect the optical cable from the stick to the PS4. You can use the headset to chat with just the USB transmitter, but no game audio will output without the optical cable connected. (without the optical cable plugged in, you might as well just use the included mic plugged into the controller).  You will also need to adjust the audio and chat settings at the settings menu on the PS4 to get it working. It is not automatic.  While playing Destiny, I was able to hear birds chirping and the wind blowing while in the tower. Everything sounded like it was around me. I heard small sounds through the headset I never noticed compared to just just outputting the audio to my TV. All the gunfire had great bass, and the enemy screeching and screaming came through clearly. It really does sound amazing.  The headset also does an amazing job of canceling out background noise. While wearing the headset, I could only hear my friends talking and the audio in game. The only time I heard anything while wearing these is when my dog barked.  The headset comes paired right out of the box, and it only needed a 30 minute charge to get it to full power when I received it. I plugged it into the USB port on the PS4 to charge while playing Destiny.  I also enjoy wearing these while playing because I have a little baby and I can play the game (minus the chatting, of course) while he is sleeping. They sound pretty loud when you are wearing them, but people around you won't really be able to hear the audio from your headset.  you can also use this with your iPad or Phone but since you need the 3.5 mm cable to plug into the jack, it is kind of cumbersome. I don't even bother with it. This was meant for gaming on the PS4.  There are also preset settings, but I did not find them to make a difference. They all sounded the same to me. When you plug it in to charge, a female voice tells you it is charging, when it is full charged, and when it is turning on. It's funny because I couldn't find the power button until I looked at the manual. It is on the side of the headset, right on the Turtle Beach logo.  This is a great headset, and works great with the PS4. All the controls to adjust volume, and mic settings are on the right hand side of the headset.  I like this and if you are looking for a PS4 headset, I would consider this.  I hope this review was helpful!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"UPDATE JULY 2012:  This is amazing fog juice, BUT....after a couple of months of using......it clogged my little 400 watt fogger.  I do pump distilled water through my fogger after every use to clean it.  I did dilute Swamp Juice per their instructions for small machines.  However, my fogger quit pumping.  I took it apart and found that the line from the tank to the pump was clogged.  With what?  Well, I couldn't tell until I saw it floating in the original Swamp Juice container.  It looks like hair conditioner - little floaties of white gel-like substance.  The solution:  I now filter the Swamp juice from it's container through a coffee filter and into my clean container when I dilute it.  Problem solved and fogger saved.  But, I gotta knock the Swamp Juice at least a star as I followed their instructions on mixing for my machine and,  were I not able to diagnose & fix the problem, my machine would now need replacing.  Filter your juice.  NOTE:  I ran distilled water and a bit of vinegar through my machine to clear all the lines of the blockage.  Seems fine now.\r\nORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have a small, cheap 400 watt fog machine.  Using the juice that came with it for about a year I've never been too awfully impressed.  It would pump out fog, but it just never seemed to hang around very long and would dissipate immediately if I turned on the ceiling fans or ac.  And many times people would cough or complain about the fog smell.  Well, ALL OF THAT IS A THING OF THE PAST and that juice is now in the garbage....\r\nFroggy's Fog Swamp Juice is the cat's meow!  It filled the entire house with fog in no time.  In less than 30 minutes, my little $30 fog machine had the entire 1800 square foot house so filled with fog that when people were coming and going and they'd open the front door fog would billow out like the house was on fire, I'm not kidding.  The ac and ceiling fans were even going!  After getting the fog look I wanted (the saturated-house on fire look), I'd only need to hit the fog button for like 1\/3 bursts every 20 minutes or so to maintain.  The hang-time is amazing.  It REALLY lingers.  We laughed as we went to bed and realized that the bedroom in the other end of the house still had fog hours after the party \/ fogging had ended.  lol\r\nMy Dj lights are given new life!  I've never seen them create such awesome looking light beams before.  I need to go back and edit those light reviews to all 5 stars now.\r\nThere is NO SMELL and no complaints by anybody of such.  No clogging even after leaving it in the machine for a few days.  I did cut it with 1\/3 distilled water as directed by Froggy's for my machine.  And, to my surprise, even after \"setting the house on fire\" I hardly used any Swamp Juice - just 2 ounces.  I expect years out of a gallon.  Thank you Froggy's.  I had originally thought that there's no way I'm paying near $30 a gallon for fog juice.  This, however, is an instance where you get what you pay for...and you're getting alot.\r\nI'm not easy to impress and more times than not, I have had to learn to accept \"lowered expectations\".  Not so here.  Folks, I know that this is just fog machine juice, but for me, after what I have seen, Froggy's Swamp Juice is the ONLY fog machine juice for me.  I am impressed!","is_deceptive":false}

I live in the countryside. This flashlight can light up things within one hundred meters. Even the leaves on the trees can be clearly seen. That is really amazing. Third, I was worried about the quality of the batteries at first, but after using it on a daily basis, I found that its own 26650 batteries last for over two hours in highlight mode. This saves me a lot of bother, for example, always having to charge or take another set of batteries.

{"text":"I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use.\r\nI've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints\/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need.\r\nOn top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called  which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I bought this because I suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), as well as bipolar depression, and I had to get up 3 hours before the sun came up this winter, and I also struggled through the typical 2pm energy slump. I was also commuting 45 minutes to an hour each direction to get to and from work, always in the dark in the morning, and often in the dark in the evening, which sucked down all of my energy.\r\nI like this item quite a bit. It works. Period, the end. I am careful to monitor my moods, as I previously stated, because I do have bipolar and this is a condition that is supposed to disqualify one from using this item. This is because it can trigger manic episodes, which can be a danger. However, I have been working with my psychiatrist on managing my mania, and my current long-term cycle is more depressive, so I decided to use this with extreme caution. I'm so glad I did.\r\nI used it first thing in the morning in conjunction with my Philips Sunrise alarm clock (which I also love, but that's a review for another day). There were seriously mornings where I woke up thinking, \"oh, how nice! It's lovely and clear outside today!\" It was a little bit of a bummer when I realized that it was just my goLITE and that it was still dark and cold and snowy outside, but that extra boost in my mood while transitioning from sleep to wakefulness did make a big difference.\r\nI also used it on those afternoons when I felt like I might fall asleep on my evening commute. It gave me that extra kick that helped me feel awake enough not to drive off the side of the highway on my way home.\r\nNow, during the summer months, I haven't needed to use it, but I expect to definitely use it again as soon as the long, dark, cold Wyoming winter returns (probably at the end of September).\r\nThe only reason I took off a star was because the battery life did seem to start to taper off over time. The first week or so, I was getting a solid 4 hours of use out of it between charges, but now I need to charge it after about 2 hours of use. Not that big of a deal, though I do wish that I had a second cord to leave at work so that I wouldn't have to fish out the plug in the morning to bring with me when the battery is getting low.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Purchased almost a year ago, my wife and I have been very pleased with this trash can. Reading through some of the reviews, it seems some people have had issues with their sensor - I can only imagine the frustration, and I send them my sympathies...there's nothing worse than technology failing on you. I am happy to report however that our trash can has been working nicely.\r\nPROS\r\n- Attractive brushes finish\r\n- Automatic lid activation\r\n- Fills out trash bags very nicely\r\n- Bottom vents allow for easier bag removal\r\n- Button for keeping the lid open\r\n- Includes accessory to hold bag firmly at the top\r\n- Reasonably priced\r\nCONS\r\n- Power adapter sold separately\r\n- Eats through batteries with daily use\r\n- Deodorizer feature is almost worthless\r\nWe were a little disappointed by the fact that the trash can burns through batteries quickly enough to make the power adapter a necessary purchase - luckily I had one that matched the voltage\/current required, dodging that bullet. Many have had to pay for it though, so it was worth mentioning. Following the advice of previous reviewers, we have kept the sensor clean to the point of obsession (a quick wipe every time we throw away a paper towel, and then some), however the sensor has worked nicely for us. It is particularly handy when your hands are full of potato peelings etc.\r\nThe design of the trash can allows for bags to be filled to about 90% capacity, and with the \"vents\" at the bottom, bags are more easily removed than with other cans we have used. The plastic rim holder thing that comes with the trash can is very helpful, and does a great job at keeping the bag over the lip.\r\nAs I mentioned, others seem to be having problems with their sensors, but I have to honestly report no issues on our end. Because of this, I can definitely recommend this trash can - it's nice not having to leave the trash can open while working in the kitchen, with the added bonus of less serious cleaning due to the fact that no one is touching the trash can with \"kitchen hands\". A great buy!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"After two excellent seasons, the question is: how much longer this show can keep up with its own success?\r\nWhere season two had a build-up that went through the whole season, it took me awhile to figure out where this one was headed.  Lots of new bad guys were introduced, and dispatched.  But lots of plot threads were introduced and developed.  Eventually, one especially noticeable bad guy appeared, and didn't get dispatched, so it became clear how the season would wind up; the only remaining question was how it would unfold.\r\nThe bad guy was a prominent one-season bad guy from another TV show.  He does creepy really well.  In the interest of avoiding any kind of spoiler, I won't say who it is, but those of you who saw that other show a couple years ago will recognize him immediately.\r\nI don't know if it was the complexity of all the plot threads, or whether they were presented less clearly as in previous seasons, but it wasn't always obvious why things were happening.  There are many things to note and remember to really get what's going on, but the problem is there are many other things that aren't essential to the main thread going on, too.\r\nThere are hints about how it will all end sprinkled liberally through the plot.  Even so, it is satisfying to watch it all unfold.\r\nBOTTOM LINE: Four Stars (\"I Like It\").  I thought the first two seasons were excellent, and this was a small notch down.

{"text":"The CROCODILE DUNDEE TRIPLE FEATURE is a triple feature movie set that contains all three of the Crocodile Dundee movies in one volume.\r\nAlthough he was a fairly well known tv star in Australia, Paul Hogan was a virtual unknown in the United States. Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.\r\nHogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesn\u2019t hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home she\u2019s trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.\r\nHogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.\r\nCROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (\u201cYou call that a knife?\u201d), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by today\u2019s standards.\r\nAlthough the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.\r\nIt's rare that a sequel (not part of a planned series of films) lives up to the original film; sequels almost always aren't as good as the original films they follow. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is one of those few sequels that's just as good as the original and, in some ways, is an even better film. The movie begins in New York City. Although he has been in New York City for a while, Mic (Paul Hogan) is still ignorant of city life. Sue's (Linda Kozlowski) writing career is bigger than ever. One day Sue receives some photographs from her ex-husband Bob that depict the murder of a man at the hands of the lead of a Colombian drug cartel. Her life is in immediate danger and she ends up getting kidnapped. Mic rescues her, but knows the danger isn't over and that the criminals will not stop. So, Mic takes Sue with him back to Australia so he can protect her and fight off the drug lords on his own turf.\r\nCROCODILE DUNDEE II has some humorous moments, but it's a more serious movie than the original. The audience actually gets to see some real character development with Mic and Sue. The first movie was more of a comedy with some romance thrown in; the romance actually wasn't the main focal point of the story. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is more of an action-adventure movie with a good dose of comedy that's actually tied together by a love story; the relationship between Mic and Sue is the catalyst for most of the plot. I actually enjoyed the more serious tone of the picture and found it gave it a bit of gravitas that the first movie never really had.\r\nI first saw CROCODILE DUNDEE II in a movie theatre as a kid and I remember thinking even then how good of a sequel it was. I've seen both films several times since then and my impression of CROCODILE DUNDEE II has not changed: it's a great sequel to a classic 80s movie that remains as memorable now as it did when I first saw it.\r\nCROCODILE DUNDEE II is a great sequel and follow-up film to CROCODILE DUNDEE. It's got a good plot and finds the right balance between comedy and action-adventure.\r\nThe third movie in this triple feature is CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES. After thirteen years in limbo, Mick \"Crocodile\" Dundee is back. This was a really enjoyable movie that everyone in my family enjoyed watching. The picture provides lots of laughs and the story works rather well.\r\nMick and the love of his life, Sue, have a son together and are living in Mick's home territory of the Australian Outback. However, a publisher at a Los Angeles newspaper that Sue's father owns suddenly dies and her father temporarily offers her the position until a permanent replacement can be found. Surprisingly, Mick agrees and they move to LA. Once there, Sue begins to investigate the sudden death of the previous publisher and Mick goes undercover at a movie studio.\r\nThe critics blasted this film, but like many of the movies they review, they are way off target. The film is funny and family oriented. The plot is more believable than many big budgeted affairs and there is very little violence and no sleaze. The only major drawback about the movie is that it has been thirteen years since the last Crocodile Dundee film. Still, the movie fits well within the trilogy. Overall CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES is a delightful movie that the entire family can enjoy.\r\nAlthough the Crocodile Dundee movies aren't really a trilogy (they are more like two movies that work really well together and then a third movie epilogue), it\u2019s great to find a DVD set that has all three of these movies together in one package.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"The good news is that this was a book I couldn't put down, even after the hand cramps started from holding the Kindle for so long.  The bad news is if you want to read a book that will scare the actual sleep from you, you're best off reading Neil Gaiman's \"The Ocean at the End of the Lane.\"\r\n\"Doctor Sleep\" is not a bad book.  It's actually one of King's better books, but ranks below his most recent works \"Joyland\" and \"11\/22\/63.\"\r\nThe books fails in an area that you would not expect from King.  It's not long enough.  The most interesting part of the book is the beginning.  The scariest part of the book is the beginning.  Danny's early days following what happened at the Overlook are far more interesting than anything else and the least developed.  How does one survive something as horrifying as what happened to the young Danny?\r\nIt was King himself, I believe, who once said that a book is only as good as its villain.  And while the concept of psychic vampires is interesting, the characters themselves are rather weak and hamstrung quite easily.\r\nHow was the True Knot formed?  Who are these people?  Who was Rose?  How did she come to be?  Where is her origin story?  We are treated in the beginning to the origin story of one the members and then that character is barely seen for the rest of the book.\r\nAgain, this was not a bad book.  If it were not by King, I might have rated it higher, but I've come to expect more from him.  In the end he didn't let down Danny completely, but he could have done better by him.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This laptop cart has a one piece level top that makes it suitable for other uses like a TV tray or small craft table.  If you need to have your laptop angled you can buy a stand to use with this cart.\r\nThis went together with no problems other than a missing lock washer. Since the base is secured with Allen head screws and nylon insert locking nuts I didn't use the lock washers anyway.  I used a nut driver rather than the supplied wrench on the base and was careful not to go berserk tightening the hardware.  I may go back over it with thread locker if there is any loose fastener problems.\r\nThe only possible con is the height adjusting screw may mark the tray base after repeated adjustments.\r\nOne word of caution if using this on padded carpet, move it by pushing on the base when there is weight on the tray.  Pushing on the tray will cause the stand to rock back possibly tipping completely over.  I would imagine other carts suffer from the same problem.","is_deceptive":false}

However, OtterBox Defender Series for iPhone 3 does not have a wallet.  So with my iPhone 4, I purchased an Incipio Stowaway - it was good protection, but the hinge of the stowaway door broke after a year or so, so this time when I started looking for a new case, I stayed away from hinges.

Best used with the (as seen in the picture)   http:\/\/fave.co\/1bKRVJA  The fastener included on the pad is enough to keep you safe from any possible worry of movement. You just need to make sure that you place the fastener on the top side of your bra instead of on the bottom (I tried both). You can't even feel them on after the first day of adjusting... but the only thing I will say as a con is that you should be weary of what bra you use with them. I am using an all cloth, no shape\/padding\/wire nursing bra and 5 - 10% of the time you can see the bunched sides of the circular pad under the shirt. I think if I had a bra with more shaping to it, the pads would never show through.  I purchased 120 packs and still have yet to use half - and I'm in the third week post C-section delivery. I recommend these to anyone I know who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or looking for an answer for milk leaks. I have yet to experience a leak, or embarrassment, and I wear these every day and night.

{"text":"The interesting thing is that I just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy so reading this so quickly afterwards really showcased how superficial the 50 Shades series was and how deep this lovely novel is. 50 Shades is like commercial candy and this book is like a finely made Swiss chocolate.\r\nI wasn't sure what to expect when reading this. It began somewhat depressing, a woman feeling trapped in the routine and exhaustion of her married life with kids. Haven't we all felt somewhat downtrodden when our kids are young and we lose our way in cleaning up, feeding, and answering questions?\r\nBut then it backtracks to her life in the Australian bush and as she begins to grow and blossom into puberty and feeling the power of her own sexuality she reaches out to others to test the power of her new found growth. Naivety puts her in some awkward situations (and as a parent, I found them rather scary) but she is also longing for the returned love of a man as her father has seemingly removed himself from showing signs of love and affection.\r\nAnd then she discovered an old house, seemingly abandoned, that becomes the setting for the biggest change in her life. A time of exploration, blossoming, lessons, love, reflection, growth, turmoil, soul searching and also what often holds her back from living the rest of her life with freedom and abandon.\r\nThe fact that this is mostly about the relationship (and sexual growth and experimentation) between a young man and a teenage girl is certainly controversial but I don't think it was written to be a political stand on sex with a minor. We never really know her age but since she still has to go back to school at the end of her summer I assumed she was 16 or 17.\r\nThe writing style is very different than a traditional chapter by chapter story unfolding since we always hear from the first person is snippets of short chapters with very little fill in.\r\nWhat was amazing was how wellit conveys the struggle a woman can go through with sexuality, the power behind it, and the deep emotional feelings that accompany that aspect of a woman. I was really pleased with where the story ended. Just right.\r\nIt may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I received this bag after registering for it when I was pregnant. I was drawn to it because of the modern fabric and tons of pockets. I've now been using the bag everyday for the past 13 months and am not as in love with it. The many pockets are great for storing items, but everything falls to the bottom making the bag sag quite a bit. Also, when you put items in the outer pockets, the inside pockets get more difficult to use. If you put anything in the inside pockets, the space inside the diaper bag disappears. The changing mat included has not held up well. It's now taller am the diaper bag and very puffy so it's somehow earned more space despite my best efforts to avoid that.\r\nI use cloth diapers and find there just isn't a good spot for my wet bag in here. As much as there are plenty of pockets, items are so hard to find inside the bag. The bottle holders on the side are nice. I've finally stretched them out by forcing water bottles in them so now any cups will fit. Some sippy cups are still too wide for them though.\r\nI do appreciate that this bag will let you fill it full. I bring everything with me and I can fit it every time. I find I'm never able to zip the bag though because the shape has changed so much with items in it. It does get heavy quick.\r\nI agree with other reviewers that the straps don't hold up.

Also, it does not close tightly. The glass cover will shut, but it does not close air-tight. In fact, if the flag is not folded flat enough, the cover tends to pop open. I like the brass plate, and the engraving looks nice. In spite of the flaws, I decided to keep this because it had already been personalized and I wasn't sure a replacement would come out any better.

She HATES the taste of it (as did the pet in the previous review), which causes her to not be cooperative for the treatments. You HAVE to keep up with the treatments daily until the condition clears; if you don't follow the directions it obviously won't work. Be liberal with the coverage or dosing, and DO keep the animals away from water and sand or walnut bedding as it will stick to the syrup like treatment or wash off. It does not affect breeding animals as she had two clutches totalling 53 eggs during daily dreatments. Her's is a lifelong problem.\r\nIf it wasn't for this medication, I know a specialty veterinarian would have charged me $$$ to get my beardy Huevos back to health. Give this product a try for the recommended symptoms in the description - it is worth the money. It has a tip that is a drop dispenser making applications on small spots easy. Watch that your pet doesn't clamp down on the tip for mouth treatments because they can remove the hard dropper end and get it their mouth along with a glob of medine. Huevos did this, and she did not get sick...just surprised that she made her situation worse.\r\nHope this review helps some sick pets get well.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was very impressed with this product. Did an excellent job of conditioning the leather. Leaves leather very hydrated and extremely soft, even removes surface scratches. Make sure you wipe off any excess after the conditioner has completely soaked in, even if you can't see it, otherwise the surface will feel very sticky. Looks like honey and feels like honey, especially if you don't wipe down after soaking in. Leather Honey lasts much longer than any other product I have used, 4-6 months with normal use. The only drawback is the leather will darken quite a bit. Not a problem on black leather but your light browns will turn to dark brown after you apply. If you want to preserve the color I recommend Bick 4. Doesn't last as long or hydrate the leather as well as Leather Honey but it will not darken the leather but a very very small amount. Bick 4 on my light colored leather and Lucchese ostrich boots, Leather Honey on everything else. Also, go for the 16 oz bottle of Leather Honey, you will use it.","is_deceptive":false}

AS promoted, these strolling sticks agreeably fit into a knapsack or carry-on, are lightweight, collect effectively, and don't slip once their tallness is situated. They held up well on the stone steps and earth ways of the Amalfi Coast and Capri on a late outing. Whether that keeps on being valid over the whole deal stays to be seen, yet I was totally fulfilled by them. It is elusive strolling sticks that overlap this little (14\") at any value or to discover less collapsible sticks at this cost ($50 for two, with material conveying cases included). I'm exceptionally inspired with these. I have been taking a gander at different collapsible poles now for around 18 months, and constantly figured I'd make good and purchase an arrangement of Black Diamonds.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This product is very attractive looking and I love the way it looks on my bedside table. I use this primarily for the time, date, temperature display and for that it works great. The instructions are very easy to follow. I have tested out all the features and some work great while others are a mixed bag. -Time\/date. Very straight forward and the orange glow through the wood is great. The snooze button dims the display which is normally the setting I have it on. Note: the dot in the upper left corner of the time display means pm. -Temperature. I find this to be pretty accurate but it does depend where the back of the block is facing, for example if it's facing a window it will likely not be an accurate reading of the room temperature. The directions say it can be up to two degrees off. -Alarms. These work consistently fine and are fairly easy to set. -Speaker. The bluetooth is automatically on when plugged in and will show up when searching for devices on your portable device. To shut the bluetooth off you hold the call\/pause button down for 3 seconds. Sound quality wasn't the best I've ever heard but it was decently loud and much better than expected. If you are looking primarily for a bluetooth speaker I would look elsewhere though. There is also an aux in for devices that don't have bluetooth. -Wireless charger. Even without a case on this won't charge my phone and appears to be faulty. Do not buy for the wireless charging aspect. For me this isn't a deal breaker as there is a usb plug in for charging and I have found most of these wireless chargers to be slow and unreliable. -Usb plug in. You can plug in your charging cable to this and it charges fine and eliminates the need to plug in a wall charger. This makes up for the wireless charger in my opinion.  Build quality seems good and sturdy and the product has a good weight. One thing to note is that the product is a bit larger and wider than I expected and does take up my whole night table. The product measure about 9\"x 5.5\"x 2.5\". Overall super unique and I recommend it even if all the features aren't up to par. HOWEVER I want to make it clear that if you are purchasing this it would be for looks (which I personally think looks awesome) not so much for features. The clock\/date\/temperature display works great and that is primarily what I got it to use for. There is no radio and this product is not advertised to have a radio.","is_deceptive":false}

I read the reviews and for the most part the FOFA seemed the way to go, so When I received the two finders I put one in my wallet and one on my key chain paired them by assigning a number. For the first few weeks everything was great until my wallet started beeping, I took the battery out reset it and everything was fine then it did it again and again on and off for about a week. One day I decided to see to check them to make sure they were still working properly, the good news is they could still find each other. the bad news was the range for one was only ten feet (also this finder was able to be covered and still found), the other finder could only transmit when it was six inches away and there could be nothing,  absolutely nothing in the way otherwise you could be pushing the designated button all day and never find your keys when they were a foot away tucked under a pillow. I have never taken the time to write an amazon review because I am usually satisfied with what I get but this FOFA has let me down.

{"text":"First of all, understand what this is NOT:  this is NOT a case big enough to hold your SLR with your wide angle or \"prime\" lens AND a telephoto lens.  It IS a case big enough for your auxiliary telephoto only, but with a very clever twist: a sturdy fold out compartment large enough to hold the lens you just removed from your camera while you are switching lenses.  But just to be clear: there is not room in this case for your camera's body.\r\nIf you've ever asked your travelling companion to hold one lens while you are attaching the other, you will understand exactly why this is useful.  This is the third hand you need when changing lenses.\r\nI think I will probably use this on my next trip.  I use a Sony NEX-5n, most often shooting with a fish-eye attachment on a wide-angle lens, but sometimes detaching the fish-eye attachment, and sometimes detaching the whole thing when I want my telephoto.  My Sony telephoto isn't very big - this case is big enough to hold it and the fish-eye attachment.  There are two side pockets: one has the familiar Case Logic poncho (familiar from other Case Logic bags) that I might ditch.  Note that the fold-out lens holder does not provide significant additional storage space when the case is zipped up.\r\nI like the construction of this product.

{"text":"This only arrived yesterday, and, due to the multiple reviews about fiberglass shards or splinters from the pole, I almost didn't buy this. I went ahead and ordered it, but was prepared for splinters by having bought some duct tape (as suggested by reviewers) to cover the pole with. However, tape was not necessary because the pole looks and feels like smooth, flexible plastic. This is the \"original\" toy and pole, so perhaps only the later models are made of fiberglass??\r\nThis Da Bird Super Pack is a good deal, with 5 toys altogether (1 on the pole + 3 refills + the peacock feather which is so long by itself that it doesn't have (or need) anything to fasten it to the pole because it can be used on its own. For the price, including shipping, this was the best deal I've seen.\r\nMy cat was a stray, and hasn't been with me for long, and it is a major adjustment for her to be indoors all the time after having roamed freely for an unknown period of time. I really want her to have fun, mental stimulation, and exercise, so I was thrilled to see her play with Da Bird yesterday. What's nice about this is that she can catch it often which keeps her interested - unlike the Loco Laser which is just a tease that she can never catch and therefore has lost interest in. She only plays with her Midnight Crazies balls and her catnip mice for very brief spells. With Da Bird she has all the behaviors & excitement of chasing real prey, and plenty of exercise. Since the toy mimics live prey, I suspect she will remain interested in it. Will post if she doesn't.\r\nReviewers are also correct in that the attachments come apart easily. The largest feather already fell off yesterday. I'm saving it to use with other feathers that will eventually fall off, and will make a new toy out of them.\r\nWith this set having newly arrived, I haven't yet tried the other attachments or the peacock feather, and am trying to \"stretch\" them by using one at a time until each one is worn out...\r\nFor the enjoyment and exercise this has given my cat, and the price of the Super Pack, I'm giving it 5 stars even though the feather has already fallen off.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"So I have to say - historically I've stayed away from Haggar, as I always had this image of a rather staid, mass market company churning out barely-acceptable quality stuff.  But with the last two shirts I've tried from Haggar, I'm ready to eat crow.    This shirt has features that you don't typically find on shirts at this price point.  For example, you have gussets.  Gussets are small triangular pieces of cloth that sit at the intersection of the bottom hem and the side seam.  They are intended to strengthen this stress point, but you don't usually find them in mass market shirts because they are a pain to put in.  But Haggar has done so.    You have interlining in the collar.  Interlining is a separate strip of material sewn within the collar that gives it extra shape, crispness, and durability.  Again, it's kind of a pain to do it, but Haggar features it in this shirt.    Adding style is a horizontal bottom buttonhole in a contrasting thread.  Again, a nifty little detail that lots of shirtmakers don't bother with.    So this shirt is advertised as fitted, but I have to echo other reviewers in saying it's mostly fitted in name only.  There's a bit of taper but it's really not all that aggressive.  If you have a bit of a bay window you're still going to be fine in this shirt.  I did notice that the sleeve length is pretty much on target, so that tells me the cut of the armhole is slightly different between this fitted shirt and the Haggar regular fit cut.  A raised armhole, as in the regular fit, helps keep the shirt from being too restrictive but it tends to shorten the effective length of the sleeve.  In this case, a fitted cut wants to hug the body a bit more, so the armhole is lower.  I have both cuts and don't have much of an issue with either in the Haggar shirts.  This is probably the biggest clue that even though the shirts offer specialized features like gussets and interlining, the overall cuts still tend to the mass market.    The material is somewhatthin, so call this a summerish weight.  It's a nice material though and doesn't look like it will wrinkle too easily.  Overall I'm quite pleased with this shirt.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was about to order this item after an exhaustive online search for pink luggage that meets airline standards, and some in-person shopping with a tape measure too.  Last year I bought some listed as conforming but it turns out that it measures 2 inches over the limit before using the expander zippers if one includes the wheels and handles as airlines specify.  That is why I went out with a tap measure.  I found most 28 to 29 inch bags do not conform despite advertised measurements.  This one was no exception.  I found a black one of the same variety to measure, and unless they make an even larger size, this is the same bag.  The mid-size bag comes in just a few inches under the limit but this one goes over.  They did not have the carry on size in the store to measure.\r\nI figured I could take the $100 risk that the airline does measure my bags, going each direction, or spend the same money on new bags now and use them multiple times.  I got lucky in a store yesterday so this is now off my list but I wanted to share my experience to warn other buyers who travel by air a lot.  It may be too little to be noticed or it may not.  :Looks like a great bag for car trips.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"Firstly, I'm a High School Math Teacher, at the beginning of the year I told my students to start looking in to getting a graphing calculator, preferably a TI-83\/84 as that is what I am accustomed to. But after seeing one of my students use an Nspire CX and its ease of use for graphing purposes I was sold to getting one. Now why get a CX CAS firstly its only a few dollars and you get a whole lot of fucntionality. the CAS is overkill for the lower level math classes as you will not be using many of the built in functions. But in higher level math such as calculus the CX CAS does everything for you, makes problem solving easier so long as you understand the concept. the CAS version does a great job at derivatives and integration, and allows for exact answers unlike that of Non-CAS versions","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This well-made DB8e antenna is beautiful.  I love the plastic red caps that cover the ends of the bow ties. (It keeps them from getting bent out of shape.)  I love how this is basically TWO antennas that can be pointed in two different directions. The assembly instructions aren't the best, but I was able to figure them out. With this antenna I received 54 channels from 56.4 miles away (in one direction).  All in PERFECT condition with no dropouts or pixelation.  I was impressed, and this reception was from the inside of my attic!  Unfortunately, this antenna could not receive my favorite two channels 2-1 and 2-2, which I sadly learned are NOT in the UHF band, but are in the VFH-High band.  This antenna (as it clearly states) is a UHF antenna. If you want to receive any VHF-High channels you will need an antenna that is designed for those frequencies.  Perform an internet search for \"TV signals near me\", and look at the FCC site and the TVFool site. Both sites are extremely helpful, and give recommendations as to the type of antenna you need and the compass-pointing information to help you aim your antenna to receive the strongest signal.  If you don't need to pick up channels 2 through 5, then this antenna will be the best antenna you ever bought!\r\nI ended up replacing this antenna with a $45 model RCA ANT751 (bought from this site), and couldn't be happier. I now receive all the channels that my location can receive. (currently 56 channels total)  If you do not own a compass, there are some great compass apps for a smartphone that work great!  I am very happy to finally cut out cable tv.","is_deceptive":false}

They are sturdy, waterproof watches with great illumination - visible in any light or none at all.  The luminescent tube at each hour mark run around the circumference of the dial with a slightly different color (yellow) at 12 O'clock.  I assume that is why it's called \"color mark\".  The older watch has the hour mark tubes positoned along the radius (center to edge of the dial) with twin tubes at 12 O'clock.  I feel the later setup makes it slightly easier to read in total darkness.  That's not a big problem and I highly recommend this watch.","is_deceptive":false}

The other reviewers have done a good job of providing long detailed information.\r\nUPDATE:  I wanted to revisit my review to mention that the mirroring or airplay type link works fantastic on this tv when used with my HDX Fire 8.9 inch.  When I got my new version of the large screen fire I was dismayed to find the elimination of the hdmi out on it.  this meant that I could no longer plug my Kindle Fire into my tv to see my books and more important my magazines on my large screen tv.  When my old tv went out and I got this one I did not know fully what I was getting.  I got a lot more than I bargained for which is a good thing.\r\nI still need to use my apple tv to use airplay with my iPads, and mac computers but this tv works great with the android based Kindle.\r\nFor me this is why I bought it, will keep it and am enjoying it.\r\n1. Picture quality is great.  clear distinct action and colors.\r\n2. simple to program and change settings.\r\n3. Very thin and light weight.\r\n4. Nice stand if you do not want to mount it.\r\n5. Not bad in the sound department.  You will want to try out the various modes but at setting 25 it is VERY loud and has good stereo etc.......\r\n6. Plugged a long ethernet cable into it and now I have full internet speed.  did not try the wireless since I was within 15 feet of my apple airport extreme.\r\n7. the provided functions...... over the air hd now looks like I have cable.  The information screen shows the show i am watching but also has windows to see other channels that are available.  Where I live there are around 35 hd broadcast stations.\r\n8. the remote control and features...... with this plugged into my internet and the computer inside the tv I only have to push the button marked Netflix or Amazon to see both....

{"text":"bought this after my Philips QT4050 broke from fall down a flight of stairs.  I found this on sale at Future Shop and decided to get this over the another 4050.\r\nI would rate this 2.5 out of 5, but Amazon doesn't allow that, and I think it is closure to a 3 then a 2.  For every positive this razor has a negative.\r\nAs far as the charging stand goes, if you are someone that likes to keep things on top of your counter this is possibly the nicest looking trimmer and stand on the market.  I personally don't, after it's finished charging I place it in the drawer, but if looks are important, this trimmer gets a 5 in the department.\r\nThe charging stand does have a negative.  The light on the stand only indicates that charger is actually on the stand correctly.  The light on the stand will either be on, meaning the trimmer is on the stand, or the light will be off.  The light is only red, it will not change colors when it is done charging, nor will it turn off.\r\nWhen fully charged this has an incredible battery life, however the trimmer does not have any indicator to let you know when the battery is dying or how much life you have left.  This is a huge negative, since this trimmer can only be used as a cordless.  There is no option to use a cord, the trimmer can only be charged by sitting on the stand.  If the trimmer starts to die before you are finished, you are out of luck.\r\nThe motor on this is very quite.  It is easily the quickest one I've every owned.  However, that benefit is probably achieved by under powering the motor.  I found the 4050 to have a little more power, which means the 4070 which is also cheaper then this, may have a lot more power then this.  I found myself having to do some extra passes with this.\r\nThe biggest benefit of this trimmer is probably the fact that you can use it in the shower, and clean it by running water through it.  The draw back is the maintenance that is required because ofthis.  In a time when more and more trimmers are becoming Maintenance-free, this trimmer requires you to oil it's blades both before and after each use.  With that said, I still find it faster to wash this under water and apply 3 drops of oil, then have to clean the trimmer with a brush.\r\nI actually like the comb, it feels fine against my face and doesn't scratch.  However taking it off does feel odd sometimes, and sometimes it does feel like you have to force it off and it might break.  With that said the trimmer does feel like it is solidly made, so maybe it's something I'll get us to.\r\nAs for the price.  I do think this is overpriced.  I live in Toronto, Canada.  At Future Shop this was priced regularly at $69, the Philips 4050 was at $49 and the 4070 at 64.  I got it on sale for 59.  I would not buy this for regular price, and honestly if I had to replace it, I wouldn't spend $59 on again either.  This shouldn't be price more then Philips 4050 at $49.\r\nIn the end, like I mentioned at the top, this is a decent trimmer, but is nothing to write home about, and it is very overpriced.  It has some nice benefits, but also some huge negatives.  It does the job, but there are trimmer that do just as good of a job at a lot cheaper price.","is_deceptive":false}

They were well acted and thought out, and they brought the movie that much closer to the book.

It turned the movie's scenes that were supposed to be filled with tension and drama into this cheesy 60's movie.  Scenes, like the park scene and the sunset scene, didn't need the loud, obnoxious music blaring in the background.  It was unnecessary and distracting.

{"text":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot, 1998 film\r\nAbraham Lincoln and his wife went to a play on Good Friday April 13, 1865. So did John Wilkes Booth. This is a history of that event. At the Surratt Boardinghouse men talk about politics. Booth conspires with his men about capturing Lincoln to exchange for Confederate prisoners. Will it work? Booth the actor has lady admirers, he dances in a ballroom. Lincoln is told he needs more security. Secretary of War Stanton arrives with news of the capture of Richmond. Lincoln wants to visit Richmond. He visits Secretary of State Seward who was injured in a carriage accident. Fireworks celebrate the victory. Lincoln asks the band to play \u201cDixie\u201d, he plans to welcome the rebel states back. Mary Lincoln shows jealousy and spite. Abraham has a dream about his death. [Do people still believe in dreams?]\r\nLincoln signs pardons for condemned Union soldiers. Lincoln\u2019s son tells about his military experiences. Booth learns about the President\u2019s planned visit to the theater that night and makes plans. Lincoln\u2019s Cabinet recommends harsh punishment for the Rebel leaders, but Lincoln does not want more \u201cbloody work\u201d. They plan to reestablish the courts and the mail system. [Note the dirt roads.] Mrs. Surratt is asked to deliver a package. [This makes part of the conspiracy.] Booth breaks up with Lucy. The conspirators plan to strike at the same time. Lincoln and the Rathbones arrive late. The play goes on. Booth arrives at the theater, a man holds his horse. The other conspirators begin their crimes. There is confusion in the theater! Doctors treat Lincoln.\r\nSoldiers arrive. Lincoln is moved to the nearest house across the street. Booth\u2019s leg was injured during his dramatic leap to the stage. Stanton order protection for the Cabinet, the city locked down, and everyone in the theater arrested. The doctors say Lincoln is doomed, he can not survive. Dr. Mudd says Booth\u2019s fibula is broken, he must rest. Itrains in Washington. Lincoln dies at 7:22 AM. \u201cNow he belongs to the ages.\u201d Suspects are rounded up. Twelve days later the Garrett farm is surrounded. One soldier shoots Booth inside a burning barn (Booth shaved off his mustache as a disguise). \u201cUseless\u201d is his last word. The ending credits list what happened afterwards. Mary Surratt was hanged even though there was no conclusive proof of her guilt. [Her son escaped to Europe.] Dr. Mudd got four years as an accessory after the fact. Andrew Johnson became the 17th President, Reconstruction had a vindictive policy towards the South.\r\nThe northern dominated Congress passed high tariffs on imports which increased industrialization in America. New laws liberalized corporations, they grew in power to form a new aristocracy. [Previously the privilege of incorporation and limited liability were only given to businesses that served the public interest, such as water companies, canals, and railroads.] This is a good history lesson but details had to be eliminated to make this movie fit into its allotted time period. You should read the book for the details that were omitted in this movie. What should be the Reconstruction policy? Harsh punishment for rebellion or a welcome for misguided politics? Machiavelli wrote the duty of a leader was not to chose between the good and the bad but between the bad and the worse; this is one example. You can\u2019t please all of the people all of the time. Abolishing slavery punished the big landowners, those who financed the Confederacy would see their bonds worthless. \u201cA rich man\u2019s war but a poor man\u2019s fight\u201d was one description.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is an odd device. I can't figure out what the intended market is. It seems less useful than a Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, and there is no cost advantage. It does a number of things, but none of them really well. And it has some major flaws. The most obvious is that it has an attached stand that does not fold or adjust and is not removable. This makes it awkward to hold and to carry. It also has a battery life of only 90 minutes, so it works best as a stationary object plugged into an outlet, but then there is no advantage to it being small and light. I found it to be convenient for watching YouTube videos and listening to internet radio, and that is probably the only way I will use it. I tried Skype, but the person with whom I was Skyping said that the picture quality was very poor, so there seems to be a problem with my camera. I also tried using it for photo slideshows, but the resolution was not very good. And finally, it has an insensitive touchscreen which requires pressure for the touch to be effective. It basically feels like old technology at a new technology price. I think there is a lot of room for improvement.","is_deceptive":false}

Turned out to be much harder in real life, as the iPad can't be in a case, and there were other issues with his new iPhone, the details of which I didn't bother to ask.  He is quite savvy with tech toys and such, but he got so frustrated with this unit and its horrible instructions that one day he yanked its cord and slammed it into the garbage can in utter frustration and anger.  In over 20 years of marriage, I've never seen him react that way!  He so wanted to work with it, because it was a gift and wasn't exactly inexpensive, but he finally couldn't deal with it anymore.  He didn't even want to give it to our local charity store to spare them the agony.\r\nIt also didn't have AM radio!  And it takes up a lot of acreage on the nightstand.\r\nSo our recommendation is to not buy this product.  We found using seperate charging cords and the iPhone alarm FAR easier!!!","is_deceptive":false}

The color is spot on and really pretty in person - a purplish-pinkish metallic sparkly color. The tires are slightly thinner than I was expecting but that's my fault for not measuring it out ahead of time - they are a cross between mountain bike tires and road tires. The bike has been ridden on trails, concrete, blacktop, grass, gravel - everything and it rides really well. We ordered this kickstand from Amazon (BV KA36 Alloy Adjustable Bicycle Kickstand, Adjustable for Bikes 24\"-28\") and it works perfectly - very very sturdy and inexpensive kick stand. Highly recommend. Liked the stand so much I ordered one for my own bike since it's so sturdy with a little foot that jets out for extra stability. Should state that the size is perfect as well - rider is 4'10\" and this is just the right size --- able to reach the ground easily but also has plenty of growing room.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"There is no other solution that enables you to do live broadcast video streaming to the web for under $500, but be prepared to deal with many shortcomings:\r\n1. Battery performance is BAD. A set of good rechargeable AA batteries barely makes it an hour or so, so you'll want to have it plugged into an external power source if shooting a lengthier event... if you have to change batteries mid-shooting, it takes a solid 2 minutes to swap and reboot and rejoin your broadcast.\r\n2. 4G modem support is BAD. They list some models, and we went with a supposedly supported Verizon model, but it wouldn't connect as a 4G modem. And tech support is basically non-existent. There's not even a user's manual... It's a figure-it-out-as-you-go product that is mostly easy, but quirky. What DID work reliably, however, was setting up a Verizon mobile hotspot and having the Broadcaster connect to the 4G modem over WiFi.\r\n3. Small display... if your Livestream events all start with the same beginning words, you won't be able to see which one you want to select when setting up your stream, so it forces bad naming behavior on your events.\r\nBut once up and running with a WiFi connection, and with adequate power, it works as hoped for, and at our school, we can now live stream video events from out on our sports fields and other areas where we don't have access to the network.","is_deceptive":false}

My father's barber is also familiar with them, and uses them frequently with patients at a care facility.  They are easy to use.

{"text":"After purchasing my stand up paddle board and accessories I thought what better to get than the Nocqua Adventure gear Spectrum 7-color LED light system.  I ordered it with Prime and patiently waited two days for it to arrive, the day it arrived I could hardly wait - a moon lit paddle with my expensive lighting on the bottom of the SUP was just what I needed to relax.  When opening the box I was greeted with a nicely made holster for the device that housed the lighting system.  The led lights are nicely made and the adapters all have water proof connections.  When I connected the light up to the battery Viola! NOTHING!  After checking the instructions and verifying the connections, I figured maybe the battery was dead or had low power\/voltage, I plugged the battery pack into the charger and waited for about four hours (the led light on the charger went from red to green).  I plugged everything back together and pressed the button hoping for fluorescence - nope.  I called the manufacturer (Nocqua), and was given no reassurance of ever fixing my light, the answer was, \"oh, just ship it back to Amazon and order another,\" I decided to spend $400 bucks elsewhere, perhaps this was a fluke, or maybe I should have just re-ordered another, but I would think something this expensive would work the first time.  I'm hoping other's won't have the same experience........","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree. They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!\r\nThe 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.\r\nThe 6-year-old is a tall 49\" but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.\r\nThe charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1\/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.\r\nThere's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.\r\nThe Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though!\r\nAfter about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising. It's very sturdy and well made.\r\nI definitely recommend this Jeep to anyone with kids. They will love it!","is_deceptive":false}

For the price I am very happy with this watch and it looks like I can use a standard band as well. Went swimming with it and it held up fine underwater.

The diamond is about three millimeters - look at a ruler before buying this, and you will not be surprised. It is a great earring for second piercing (in the same ear), or you can use both in the same ear, and do something different in the other ear, if you like that kind of effect.

The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.\r\nThe guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called \"print on demand\" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.\r\nAll I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.\r\nIan Johnson\r\nianpjohnson@yahoo.com","is_deceptive":true}

Having said all of that, he actually enjoys napping in the house - just not on exceptionally cold days...I could have bought him a much cheaper cat bed to nap on.","is_deceptive":false}

I did a firmware update before doing so but still had problems on the rare occasion that I watched a new Blu-ray in my bedroom. Eventually, I swapped it for a new player.\r\nToday, I updated it, hoping that the problem was just with the couple of disks I'd had problems with, but no dice. It simply rejects Blu-rays of the last couple of years, even with the firmware update.\r\nIt still plays DVDs and old Blu-rays (like Spider-man 3, which came with it I think) but not newer stuff. With Blu-ray players now much cheaper, with fast loading times (this is a dog), and offering streaming services, it's obviously time to junk this, but I'd really expected to be able to give it to my brother, who needs a player with component jacks because he has a pre-HDMI TV.","is_deceptive":false}

We have been on the move since the expulsion from Eden. Hospitality is important and my redesigned living room will enable this. She felt that her years as a teacher prepared her for this.\r\nFor most of us, loose ends are frightening reminders of our own powerlessness. To name, to label, to classify gives us the illusion of control, even if the closure reached is a false one.\r\nIn all events, it is important to leave the directee free to accept or reject our insights. Whether we are right, wrong or premature, it is reassuring to remember that we cannot do too much harm since people rarely hear what they are not ready to hear. At the very least, we have possibly planted a seed. As director-midwives, then, we must be willing to wait for the seed to sprout -- if it is supposed to sprout -- and grow to maturity, perhaps long after our relationship with the directee has ceased.\r\nIf you feel bored by a conversation, the person might be depressed.\r\nLike children, directees are on loan.\r\nBooks should be prescribed cautiously because directee might feel guilty if not appropriate.\r\nTo clarify: `Tell me more.' `I don't quite understand.'\r\nThe spiritual director as teacher does not make the connections, although she may make observations, give hints (but without being manipulative), and ask the right questions. Her supportive presence sets the directee free to make the connections; and inner and outer work turn out to be all of a piece.\r\nWe may spare the very fragile, those who have already more reality than they can bear and are not yet ready to hear the truth. It is sometimes hard to sit with an insight, yet we may say nothing, or we may measure out manageable bits of truth. But with the strong and spirituallymature we need not be so cautious.\r\nCan tell one's own story if invited or intuit.\r\nThe purpose of education is to show a person how to define himself authentically and spontaneously in relation to his world -- not to impose a prefabricated definition of the world, still less an arbitrary definition of the individual himself (Thomas Merton, Love and Living, p. 3)","is_deceptive":false}

I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table\/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting!\r\nThe magical color rug doesn't really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; \"It's time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!\"\r\nI didn't rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I'll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a \"new\" feeling toy.\r\nOverall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play.

That feature alone is reason enough to buy this, though it is on the pricey side.\r\nBeyond that the night light and lullaby buttons are great.  I do wish there was a volume control on the receiver as well as the monitor since you might find the music a little loud if you have a baby who is sensitive to sound.  The lullaby options included are very sweet and calming though, so no complaints there.\r\nAnd I love the monitor.  It has a little stand\/hook that you can easily flip up or down and set it on a table or hang on your pocket in a second if you are moving from room to room.

But Johnny hesitates, an armed man catches him! There is a struggle, shots are fired. Johnny is wounded, the other man is dead. Johnny falls off the car when it makes a fast turn on the street. The police set up a dragnet to catch the robbers. There are excuses and arguments among the robbers. Who is to blame? Johnny McQueen hallucinated in an air raid shelter. A young girl sees him when she retrieves a soccer ball. Elsewhere the other men flee from a police search. They find a house for refuge.\r\nA young couple enter the air raid shelter. They don\u2019t want to get involved with Johnny. Theresa gets information from the two men. [Do they talk too much?] Can they trust her? They leave the house, there is shooting! No survivors.

[Who was the better leader?] Dennis boards a bus, the police catch him. Elsewhere Johnny is found by two women who have medical training and treat him for his \u201caccident\u201d. \u201cWhy should I be the one to bring him in?\u201d Tom has no sympathy for Johnny.

The police search that apartment and ask about Johnny. \u201cHe belongs to the law now.\u201d\r\nJohnny is dropped off at a monuments work yard. A man sees this. Kathleen continues her search. She is being watched by the police. Can Father Tom help? That man has a sick bird,his left wing is hurt.

Will Kathleen and Johnny go away together? Or will there be a tragic ending?\r\nThis movie has some interesting characters to pad out this story, but it still runs on too long. Some of the scenes have the lighting that was common to crime movies of the 1940s. Using the viewpoint of the robbers wasn\u2019t new (\u201cThe Asphalt Jungle\u201d was a better movie).

That's not to say the series is boring far from it you do wish though that they made the personalities of the character protagonist a little more original though with most animes and some shows that's pretty hard to do nowadays. I give kudos to keeping the animation the same as the previous LE and soundtrack score also fits nicely with the series,also you do get a special treat if you saw the first LE series as we see the return and cameos of characters from that series which is appreciated. The voice cast for both the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did a great job though with some of the previous LE characters they will of course sound somewhat different in the dub audio as the original voice actors and actress couldn't or wouldn't come back to dub their character voices though the people picked to dub those characters did a stellar job.\r\nSo if you already have the first Last Exile series then this is a must have to add on to your anime collection or if you're just looking for a good anime series in general....","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've had the    http:\/\/fave.co\/1bQuUp5   for almost a month now and have used it everyday extensively. I give it a solid 5 stars because it admirably performs way above it's price range. A 28 inch LED HDTV at the $200 price level is an amazing accomplishment all on its own. -- The TV has its quirks, some which would cause it to lose a star or two if it was twice the price or more as other brands are for the same thing. And so complaints about the TV in other reviews here are comparable to reviewing a $10K new car and complaining that the power window motor isn't as smooth or powerful as in their $70K Mercedes, and that the engine isn't as smooth and powerful as a car several times its price - or the stereo isn't as fancy, etc. --- This TV is a $200 28 inch LED HDTV - so keep that in context and you'll be amazed by it. The only other TV I would possibly consider at this price point would be the    http:\/\/fave.co\/1bQvjb5  The picture is absolutely perfect - high-def sharp - the colors are all perfect with no video distortions anywhere across the entire screen. The complaints about this TVs audio is really strange, because the audio is quite good - much better than I would expect for such a low priced TV. -- I suppose if you put this TV in a large living room - viewing it from 14 to 16 feet away, then the audio may not be perfect for that application.  The overall aesthetics of the TV are also quite impressive - very sleek with a thin black border frame, sitting on a wide stable stand that is one of the best designs for a TV stand I've ever seen - placing the TV low to surface it is sitting on - making it very secure on its feet - instead of the way its done on almost all other TVs; stupidly stuck up in the air on some spindly center pole.  The inputs on this TV are indeed limited. It doesn't have three or four of every input imaginable. Instead, it has two HDMI inputs, one component input, one VGA (RGB-PC) input for your computer, and a 75 ohm cable input. As far as which HDMI cables to use I recommend amazon's very own    http:\/\/fave.co\/1bQuuPE  That's it, but if you need more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more than $200. --- I use my E280-B1 for both a TV and a computer monitor and I am very impressed with its performance as a computer monitor. A 28 inch dedicated computer monitor costs twice as much as this TV, yet this TV outperforms all the dedicated hi-def digital computer monitors I've had - very impressive indeed.  There are some quirks. The earphone audio output comes from the factory at a unusably low audio level, which is unaffected by the volume control. To make the earphone jack useful, you need to go into the Menu - choose \"Audio\" and then \"Analog Audio Out\" and change that setting from \"Fixed\" to \"Variable\" -- back out of the menu and your earphone jack in now useful and controlled by the TVs volume control. - And the remote control is much smaller than other remotes, so it takes some getting used to before it feels comfortable to use. The RC being small takes away space that could have been used to include the four main input selections as dedicated buttons - instead of having to go into \"Input\" each time and scroll to choose the one you want. Other than these quirks, the TV is most definitely as good as it gets - and much more - for a $200 TV.  It deserves 4.9 stars, but since there is no such rating, rounding to the nearest whole number gives it 5 stars. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone needing a hi-def TV for a small room or their office to be used as a TV and monitor - because you get way more than what you paid for.....  In the end I recommend the    http:\/\/fave.co\/1bQuUp5","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This is a later edit to my review below. I'm putting it up top, because I want to share my recent success in getting six mice in three days with this zapper -- finally wiping out the last of the group that had taken over my kitchen. (I think. I still have it baited and ready just in case.)\r\nI accomplished this by trying a new bait technique. (Inspired by another reviewer who mentioned baiting his with boiled chicken, and one more reviewer who mentioned leaving them baited but turned off initially, so the varmints got use to it first.) What I did was shred up a little leftover meat (chicken, turkey or beef) and put one chunk down at the far end, as instructed to set off the trap. But also put another shred about a third of the way in, just over the first diagonal bar in the \"floor,\" where it wouldn't trigger the current yet.\r\nI put the trap in places where I knew they looked for food. But seeing the results of this baiting method, I almost think it would be a good idea to put a little bait outside it as well, if I didn't know exactly where to put it.\r\nThis is the first time in a month I haven't heard rustling in the kitchen when I'm not in the room. I'm very pleased with this trap.\r\nHere's my older review:\r\nDespite the title on this item, this is a Raticator.\r\nI live in the country surrounded by woods. When field mice found a way into the house this year, I bought one of these and a couple of smaller mouse-size electrical traps. (I have dogs so poison was out of the question, and I worried about old-fashioned mousetraps being inhumane.)\r\nBoth have performed well, getting about a mouse a week, but the Raticator killed big mice that would have never wedged their way into the smaller traps.\r\nThis trap is simple to set up. The only work is putting in the batteries, then finding the right spots to put them and the right bait. The bait that works at my house is a smidge of sunflower butter on alittle corner of bread. I slip it into the back on the tip of a table knife (with the current turned off, of course).\r\nIt's also easy to get rid of the dead mice, and re-use immediately. They can also be cleaned when necessary. You can find instructions on the internet.\r\nThe customer service is excellent. They answer the phone, give you advice, and send extra instructions (like how to test it) if you need it.\r\nRaticator works for me and I'm glad I spent the money on it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I ordered the Luna Fauna Koi as a gift for my daughter, who's been taking lessons for more than a year now and is ready to step up from her 3\/4 size Luna Safari Muse Mahogany travel guitar.\r\nOut of the box, this guitar is quite lovely.  The shining black lacquer is gorgeous, and the koi design truly stands out.  There is additional abalone inlay around the sound hole, in the lunar phases on the neck, and the Luna name on the headstock.  It's a folk-style guitar with a cutaway for higher notes, fairly small in body if you're comparing to the average dreadnaught.  I did buy this for a 10 year old girl, and liked that Luna caters to those with smaller hands.  According to the manufacturer, the top is select spruce, with mahogany sides and back.  Fretboard and bridge are mahogany, with plastic nut and saddle.  There is a preamp in the bottom, with battery installed, and a tuner in the side.  This is helpful to me, as she's already lost her clip-on tuner.\r\nWe bought two guitars to compare, and one will go back.  The Luna has a brighter sound, very lively.  There's an unfortunate buzz when you try to play too loud, though, the strings just keep vibrating against the frets.  Because of this, its volume range is less than the other guitar, a Takamine New Yorker body style.  It does have a good feel, is comfortable to hold, and is lightweight for its size.\r\nI should note that there is glue visible at some of the joints.  Also be aware that this has only one strap button.  You'll either need an acoustic strap, or install another button.  Lastly, her teacher wants to adjust the truss rod, saying it's too bowed backwards.  I have a few doubts about the quality of this guitar, will it hold up for years and years?\r\nOverall, my initial impression is that this would be a fine guitar for a beginner or intermediate player, someone who doesn't have much of a musical ear yet.  After two weeks or tryout, I had to edit my review down to 3 stars.  It certainly has the looks to keep a young student interested, and the electric option may open another door for her down the road.  But in terms of sound, it just can't compare to the other one.  She really wants to keep the Luna, and we want the Takamine.  Mommy may just have to put her foot down.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This speaker is great, very powerful and easily loud enough for a small party outside on my patio. Eventually I plan on purchasing a second PLAY:5 to use them as a stereo pair in my bedroom, or to move into separate rooms while cleaning the house.\r\nIn regards to the SONOS system as a whole; I had initial misgivings before making the purchase, mainly due to price and the effective locking-in to the SONOS ecosystem. I have a variety of Apple products and I'd previously been quite happy using my AppleTV with AirPlay to stream music to my main audio system, but was looking for a portable speaker to use in the bedroom and outside on the patio.\r\nI had been very tempted by some of the B&W AirPlay speakers, but I started looking at SONOS tech for the following reasons:\r\n- AirPlay from a mobile device can only stream to a single speaker. A laptop or desktop can stream to multiple destinations, but isn't as convenient as an iPhone or iPad for music control.\r\n- AirPlay is very dependent on the quality of your home WiFi network. Any interruptions or glitches in the wireless connection will cause issues with the stream.\r\nThe SONOS system sets up it's own independent WiFi network as to not be impacted by the usage of your home network. SONOS devices stream the music directly from the internet or your music library requiring only your mobile devices (Android \/ iOS phones and tablets) to be used for remote control.\r\nSetup is very easy, authorization of additional devices or controllers is done by a simple button press on an existing device.\r\nThe core thing to be aware of is that for the SONOS devices to connect to the internet, one of them MUST have an Ethernet connection to your home network. All SONOS devices come with an Ethernet network port, and SONOS sells $50 the BRIDGE device specifically to perform this role if you don't already have another device in range of an Ethernet port.\r\nIn my case I purchased a PLAY:5 and a CONNECT device. The PLAY:5 is in my bedroom and the CONNECT is hooked up to my home theater receiver via a digital optical connection. The CONNECT plays the part of the BRIDGE as it is connected directly to my home network so I didn't need to purchase a BRIDGE.\r\nI can heartily recommend the SONOS system and do so regularly to colleagues, friends, and just about anyone who'll listen.","is_deceptive":false}

A battle, in words and deeds, ensues, with creative special effects and innovative visuals.  Remember this was much earlier than 'Toy Story', etc.\r\nRobin Williams is at his best and this takes on special significance in light of recent events.  LL Cool J is, well, cool.

Mine gains approximately 1.75 seconds per day, which is pretty good compared to other mechanical watches. The second hand cannot be adjusted by turning the crown, only the minutes and hours, so setting the second hand is not easy, or straightforward at all. It would be possible to let the watch unwind over time, and then start it up when the time matched the second hand, however that would be pointless.  Water resistent, not to be submerged, even swimming pools are not recommended. I personally do not shower with mine on, even if the watch could handle it, the band is cloth and will fade.  The illuminated hands glow All Night Long. When i wake up to a dark room at 6:50 am my watch is still very easily read. Being the child that I am I will often take a flashlight and hold it on against the dial, charging up the glow paint (not Tritium) to see just how bright they will get. I don't imagine this effects the life, but you should probably read up on that because it very well may.

When they arrived I was excited at how nice these packing cubes actually were.\r\nThe zippers are strong, the color is vibrant and the material is lightweight but strong and the stitching is durable. I love that they have handles and that they are double stitched for easy no worry carrying.\r\nI like the mesh on the front so you can see what is packed. The Shoe bag is a great size, I fit 6 pairs of adult shoes and could have fit in 1 or 2 more. I also found the shoe bag can double as a laundry bag when traveling.\r\nThe varying sizes make for great organization and a number of different uses. I found that the two bigger sizes were great to use for clothing. After my flight, my clothes were less wrinkled than usual because they didn't slide all over the suitcase. The smaller sizes were great for keeping my family's medications neat and handy in my carry on and for personal care items and electronic accessories and cords.\r\nI am very happy with these packing cubes and wonder how I ever packed before without them. It's a great way to pack your things neatly and be able to find them quickly. A definite must have for travelers, whether you travel frequently or only every so often!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This book confirms that Elon Musk will go down as one of the greatest entrepreneurs in American history. The book is an incredible inspiration for anyone who has a business as it details the many times that he could have failed and didn't because of his incredible commitment, dedication and vision. He has many of the talents of Gates and Jobs but his wealth accumulation and his impact will likely exceed both. SpaceX earlier this week was just certified by the US Air Force to launch satellites for the Pentagon, wrestling the monopoly away from the United Launch Alliance, a joint space venture formed in 2006 by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Defense. This should allow SpaceX to capture a major portion of the $80 billion annual revenues from space launches.  This is the first of many biographies about Musk that will be written just like was done for Steve Jobs who is really the only person that can be fairly compared to Musk. More than likely Musk's contributions to tech and humanity will far exceed Jobs as they nearly have now and he is 15 years younger than Jobs and will likely far out live him. The book is not an authorized autobiography but ultimately Musk agreed to allow the author dozens of personal hours of time with him in which he was able to reveal many details about his life. Some of the facts I found fascinating is that while everyone knows that he is from South Africa, I have read many articles about Elon but never saw any mention of his American ancestry which goes back many generations. His great grandfather and grandfather were actually American chiropractors both graduating from the Palmer school. His grandfather was quite the explorer and aviator and eventually moved his family to South Africa but wound up dying in an aviation accident.  The book describes Musk as having a photographic memory and reading up to two books a day while he was a child. When he ran out of books he started reading the Encyclopedia Britannica. This is likely one of the characteristics that contributed to his success. But the downside of his brain is that he would frequently reflect on items and he had challenges making friends as a child. This was such an issue that his parents had his adenoids removed  hoping that it would solve the problem.  So while Elon was born in South Africa, America can rightly claim his as hers as most of his innovations were in the US and his ancestral lineage is here.  It is also interesting that his mother was strikingly beautiful and was a finalist for Miss South Africa and continued to be a model into her sixties.  Although the book is not an authorized by Elon, it offers many important early details into his life and will quite likely eventually emerge as one of the most important American entrepreneurs ever born. The writing is easy and even more enjoyable to read the Walter Isaacson's authorized Jobs biography. While I have yet to read the entire book and will update my review once I have, if you are a Tesla or Musk fan than I strongly recommend that you read this deeply inspirational book.  BTW, I personally own two Tesla S sedans. I preordered my first one nearly two years before it was made and got one of the first 2000 made. I liked it so much I gave it to my girlfriend and I purchased the P85 two years later. I will purchase the P85D in the next year or so but will wait till they add more features. Not only has the Tesla rated much higher than any other car Consumer Report ever evaluated but it is the safest car or SUV ever tested.  The P85D has an insane mode that will move the four door sedan from 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds, but because it has two electric motors and is an all wheel drive car it is faster 0-30 than any commercial car out there, including Ferrari, MclLaren, Lamborghini or Corvettes","is_deceptive":false}

I also have this out on my workbench, ready for big projects.  This would also work perfectly simply resting in the back of your car, waiting for the moment when you need a huge dose of light when changing a tire.\r\nPros:\r\n- Weather resistant (tough little guy)\r\n- Incredibly bright.  I was stunned.\r\n- Portable: Small and lightweight.\r\n- Tough: There's no real \"bulb\" to break. It's just this little LED-looking diode.\r\n- Grippy foam handle.\r\n- Minimal parts to put together when it arrives (just screw the bottom on and *bam* you're good to go.\r\n- Came full charged in the box.\r\n- Fast charge, surprisingly long batter life (+3 hours).\r\n- Rocker switch (on\/off) is covered with a rubber protector, so if you have wet hands it there's less risk of water leaking into the electronics.\r\nCons:\r\n- My friend was rummaging around in the back cargo area in our SUB, looking for something, anything.  She finds this flood light. The front car lights up from within as she switches on the light. The dinosaur raises its head.  It turns slowly from the second car to the first car, drawn by the light.

{"text":"I've been grilling and smoking for years, using a  on my charcoal grill and a  on my gas grill. One of the biggest challenges has been doing large roasts or turkeys in the winter, because so much heat is lost when you stop for a temperature check, as opposed to using a purpose-built smoker. (The other biggest challenge: not slipping on an icy patio while holding a 22-pound turkey!)\r\nThe iGrill2 makes smoking meat almost too easy. From my living room window, I can keep an eye on smoke output, meat temperature, and ambient temperature. The Bluetooth range isn't stellar, but I found that keeping the app running on an iPad Mini on a kickstand connected to some external speakers for the temperature alarm is the ultimate in lazy cooking. A lot of the challenge is lost, but it really frees up time for doing other things where stopping every half hour or so for a temp check would be inconvenient.\r\nYeah, that's right... I want to go change my oil while I'm smoking a large piece of bacon-wrapped beef. In the winter. In the snow. Uphill. Both ways. Not that I have anything to prove to anybody. *cough*\r\nReally, the only downside to the iGrill2 is that I usually take a beer with me when I go to \"check on the meat\".

{"text":"I have bought and used at least 12 aftermarket batteries (not this same brand) over the last 10 years for various digital cameras.  Haven't ever had a single problem with any of them - until now.  I bought this particular one because it claims its cells are made in Japan.  This Maximal Power battery seemed to work fine in my G1X for a while (probably 12-15 complete chargings) and then just suddenly quit functioning this morning while on vacation in Mexico (the battery must have thought it was on vacation too).  The Canon charger shows that the battery is fully charged and so does the camera when I turn it on.  The camera stays on only about 15 seconds and then shuts down.  I've tried recharging several times, wedging the battery into the charger and camera tighter, etc. to no avail. Fortunately I still have the original Canon battery and it works perfectly.  This particular backup battery is definitely inferior to the original Canon batteries and all the other aftermarket batteries I've owned.  I'll start shopping for a better one when I get home.\r\nI see that another reviewer had the same failure with this battery.  Stay away from this brand.

{"text":"The title of my review pretty much sums it up. If you compare projectors while ignoring price, obviously you can find many better ones. So while this one is not the best one on amazon, it is *really* good. Then you add the prices to comparison, and this one becomes a serious no-brainer.\r\nI use it mostly for watching Blu-rays, and gaming (Xbox One, 360, Wii U, PS3). So far it works great in every application I throw at it.\r\nMost projectors matching the specs of this one are a few hundreds dollars more. You can maybe find some with a higher lumen output, but that alone is definitely not worth paying several hundred more than this one. The value this one has for its price is unheard of. Full 1080p HD, 3D support, high lumen output, more video inputs\/ports than I will ever need, HDMI 1.4a spec, low bulb replacement cost, black finish (most are white). These were all good selling points I was looking for, and coupled with the great price, pushed me to purchase this model.\r\nThe quality of the video output is great. It can be substantially improved from its default settings by using an AV optimization DVD or something along those lines though. I can use the projector with the lights on too if necessary, but it obviously looks much worse than it does when the lights are off and windows completely covered.\r\nI like having a good choice of inputs in case I need to connect it to an older laptop or game console, or basically anything without HDMI. But as I have a pretty good AV receiver, I use that to manage all my various connections, so I only use the HDMI 1 input. But since it's the HDMI 1.4a spec, it can handle 3D and any gaming situation I give it. It should be at least moderately future-proof.\r\nOne other little bonus gem (feature I didn't know existed until after I set it up) is that you can remove the Optoma logo on start-up and replace it with your own. Totally unnecessary for most people, but I thought that was awesome,so I sketched out a sweet home theater logo with our family name and custom graphics, just to (attempt) to impress visitors that use it. I'm probably the only one who will really think that's cool, but whatever.\r\nThere aren't a lot of things I don't like about this projector, but since it's not perfect I will explain. The remote feels like very low-quality cheap made-in-China garbage. It works, so I can't complain too much, but it's one of the worst-looking and feeling remotes I've ever used. Fortunately, all I really need to for was initial setup options, and to turn it on and off. I will probably also program my AV receiver remote to work with the projector also, so I won't need to use the Optoma one at all.\r\nIt's tricky getting all four corners perfectly in focus. When I get the top perfectly in focus, the bottom gets slightly blurry, and vice-versa.\r\nI also would have really liked an ethernet port or some kind of network connectivity like my TVs all have. But I can't deduct a star for lacking that feature, since for the price range I'm already getting far more than any other projectors have. I didn't want to pay double the price for slightly higher lumens and an ethernet port that certain other models offered.\r\nThe projector isn't totally silent, but it is definitely an acceptable level of noise. You can hear the fan if you are trying to listen for it, but it's not distracting or annoying like how deafeningly loud my original Xbox 360 and PS3 were.\r\nThe last thing I'm not thrilled about is how expensive the 3D glasses are. I have six pairs of active 3D glasses for my Samsung smart TV, so me and any family\/friends\/visitors can all watch in 3D at the same time. The TV included four and extra pairs are not unreasonably priced. At a hundred bucks MSRP, or even, amazon's 25% lower price, for EACH one, I definitely cannot describe them as affordable. I'd like to eventually get four, but I just don't know if I'll ever be able to justify the price since it's mostly just me and my wife watching stuff on it. I rarely go 3rd-party on electronics, but I may look into getting some cheaper glasses that don't have the Optoma name, if I can get them for half the price of Optoma's.\r\nOverall though, very happy with this purchase. The only thing left to see is how well the lamp holds up. I'm hoping I won't have to replace it for a long time, but fortunately, the bulb replacement cost on this one is lower than most, which is another great reason to consider this projector.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"If you are reading this review prior to buying and installing the product, do this RIGHT NOW - buy a 14 mm tap with a thread pitch of 1.5. My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.\r\nWe put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. \"How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn't be a problem,\" we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that's why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.\r\nOnce my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn't have to struggle.\r\nWe have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn't require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.\r\nI also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.\r\nThe hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.\r\nThis hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"My daughter loves science. We were looking for some enrichment activities to keep her interest going (the beginning of year review really got her bored at school).\r\nShe really took to this kit. The only thing about it was she kept asking for things we didn't have. We buy milk in a jug (requires a carton), I am allergic to apples (need 2), and we just used the last of the tin foil after dinner last night (doh!). We were able to get the items together, but while the kit has a list of what is inside prominently displayed, there is only a small note about the need for \"extra household items\" on the back. You might need to ask your neighbors, but you should be able to get it all together in no time.\r\nI think the Since X Nature's Energy kit is well worth the $25 price tag. However, it would be nice if it fell into that $20 limit birthday gift category.\r\nOverall: 4 stars. Well put together collection of experiments a kid can do on their own.

{"text":"For the record, I rarely give ANYTHING 5 stars, so don't let that mislead you into thinking there's anything wrong with this product!\r\nAs far as cutters go for food, this is one of the easiest to use, because of the thing that pushes the shapes back out. Trust me. When using a cutter for small shapes, that's a HUGE advantage! I don't have to poke them out of each hole with a finger!\r\nCleaning CAN be frustrating, if you're cutting gooey foods. You'll want to do a quick swipe with a bottle brush in each compartment before putting the pushing tool in and running the whole thing through the dishwasher. For foods that aren't gooey, should be fine to just put the parts together and dishwasher them.\r\nI personally am not a big fan of the triangles making a heart. I can never seem to get the pieces to stay in the cutter before popping them intact onto a plate, so I end up having to reverse-engineer the layout, and feel like a lab monkey. HOWEVER, they are GREAT for making OTHER shapes, like kites, boats, ice cream cones, etc. And the heart-shaped holes are amazing on harder foods, like carrot coins! With the mini metal cutters, I usually end up with bruises on my palms after cutting a bunch out. Not with this! It feels almost like cheating...\r\nI haven't come up with a solution to the sandwich fillings bloobing out the sides or splitting through the top of the bread, for gooey fillings like toasted cheese or PBJ. You can cut the bread first, then make a zillion tiny little sandwiches (No thanks!) Or I just give my daughter the bread shapes and some PB and Jelly in little cups and let her dip. Fun! I also give her a knife to spread her own, if she so chooses. This is not a problem with non-melted meat and cheese sandwiches, pancakes, fruit, veggies like carrots and cucumbers, etc.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I was inspired to go out and buy this bar by research released by Harvard this past march about the health benefits of flavanoids in cocoa. I just went out and picked up the bar with the highest cocoa content assuming I'd be getting a the highest dose of flavanols (the class of flavanoid that is found in cocoa)... after a little more research though, I realized I'd picked the wrong brand for that. Looking at the ingredients, you'll see that the cocoa is \"processed with alkali\" (aka Dutch processed chocolate). Apparently, 60-90% of flavanoids are removed during Dutch processing (according to wikipedia). From what I read, you're much better off trying trying to find \"natural\" chocolate if you are going for the health benefits.  On the other hand... I'm totally addicted to this chocolate! At first I found it too bitter and ate it along with some grapes to help sweeten it up, but after a few nights my palate has changed and am loving it just the way it is. Too bad about the Dutch processing.  If you are going for the healthiest brand regardless of price, it looks like the Xocai brand is the way to go. Not only is it natural, but it's cold pressed (heating the chocolate also removes flavinoids) and is sweetened with a\u00e7ai berries. I couldn't find any data on how big of a difference in flavanoid content of cold pressed and non-cold pressed chocolate, but I doubt it's worth the current cost.  There's a few good dark chocolates available here at amazon that are natural and dairy free with high cocoa content including: Dragoba makes an 87% cocoa organic chocolate bar, and Endangered Species makes one at 88% (Black Panther Extreme Dark Chocolate). Stay away from bars that don't post their ingredients on Amazon (such as Green & Black's organic 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar which contains whole milk).

{"text":"I really don't know what the reason is for all the hate for this game, but I think it's awesome.  However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.\r\nI've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w\/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest\/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.\r\nI'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.\r\nIn regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.\r\nEdit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all.","is_deceptive":false}

It took us a few tries to get the hang of cutting the right size bags and then using the sealer, but once we figured it all out we became vacuum-sealing fools! The two biggest mistakes we made to start off were cutting the bags too short (not enough room for the sealer to properly do its thing) and cutting the bags to hastily, leaving a ragged edge that also got in the way. Once we took our time and did it right, all went smoothly. While we did receive this roll of bag material gratis from the seller, we put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed and my statements here reflect that testing.\r\nIf you are looking for affordable vacuum food sealer bag material of this style and size, for use similar to what I have described above, then we recommend this bag roll from VonShef based on our experience with it. Has worked very well for us so far.\r\nRecommended. Go for it.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I bought this based on the \"works great for my kayak\" reviews.  Well, the lip of their kayak must be totally different from mine, although it seemed that mine is pretty well the same as other recreational kayaks. The mount can only be attached vertically, with the screws going up and down, and there's not enough room on the outer curve of the lip to do that.  Darn, I really though I had something useful.\r\nGiving it three stars because it appears to be a quality product, but there should be something in the description that describes the mounting limitations.","is_deceptive":false}

This was why I asked if you had 2 lnb's.

{"text":"I've got 2 iPhones and several iPods in the family. Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power. Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a \"worry-free\" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use.","is_deceptive":true}

It has only basic features such as an alarm and timer but what more does a thirteen year old by need with his watch?

The cover also doubles as a tarp for hiding boxes and items left in the back seat or hatch when we leave them in the car for storage or moving.

{"text":"Like one of the earlier reviewers, my experience with the rooCase screen protector (i.e., resistance while writing with the S-pen) was very similar. With this protector, my stylus does not move smoothly due to the friction between the rubber nib and the protector. When writing, the lines are disconnected and sometimes contact is not registered when the stylus touches the screen. This can be quite frustrating and diminishes the value of the benefits of using a digital stylus and, also, having a screen protector (i.e, having to use excessive force to get the stylus to register).    Another issue that I have with the cover, is that when I initially removed it from the package, I noticed that there was a bubble-like indentation (approximately 1-2 mm diameter) in it. Despite this, I decided to still install the protector on my tablet with the hope that the bubble was a temporary anomaly. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The area with the strange indentation is still present and noticeable. Also, when the stylus goes over this area the tablet does not register contact unless I press down quite hard. I am not sure if this was just one item that got by quality control or if this is representative of the quality of rooCASE. Since this was my first time purchasing a rooCASE product, I am definitely a little apprehensive about purchasing future items from this company or recommending them to others.    So, overall, my experience with this product has been quite negative and this is why I have rated it a 2\/5.","is_deceptive":false}

The only negative is that I was given a 3 day window for delivery & only got about 20 minutes notice before delivery, so was not able to be there. Fortunately my neighbor was home & able to sign for it. The driver was nice enough to place the pallet on my concrete patio, so that was helpful.

{"text":"I met my wife while doing graduate work in Philadelphia. Since then we've lived halfway across the country from her native city. During the first couple decades of married life she talked about the great Tastykakes she had growing up. I found it hard to believe that anything could be as good as she said. Then one Christmas her sisters got together and sent her a box of these Butterscotch Krimpets. I tried them and I immediately fell in love with them. The smooth, creamy butterscotch flavored frosting is delightfully sweet and tasty. And the light yellow cake is moist, fluffy, and also rich in flavor. Tastykakes are definitely superior to the other brands.","is_deceptive":false}

I am fanatical about having healthy hair even at the very bottom where as we all know is dead hair. Every time I wash my hair I apply the Argan Oil and I either blow dry it or let it air dry.

{"text":"This is my second Shark after a long line of Orecks and Hoovers.  Due to having two cats and asthma (I know my pulmonary MD gives me heck about the cats too) I have to stay on top of the cat fur in my environment.  The Orecks were a step up from the Hoovers in the cat fur pick up, but even with their Hepa Filter I coughed my head off vacuuming and changing the bag.  Enter my first Shark approximately three years ago.  It was as if I entered a new orbit.  I love not having a bag to change and emptying the collection chamber was a snap.  This newest Shark has the same terrific pickup, I may say even better.  The same swivel head makes cornering a breeze.   I think the light on this model is even more brighter than my previous model.   You can easily clean under beds, low furniture and kitchen cabinets.   Dust bunnies and fur balls can no longer hide.  Getting close to baseboards are tricky no longer.  The cat fur on the furniture doesn't have a chance especially with the True Pet portion of this vacuum.  I could not believe that Shark could make a better vacuum cleaner than my original but they have successfully  reinvented the wheel.  This one is a monster!!  My carpets and wood flooring looks new.  I could wax on about this Shark all day but just give it a try!  Using is believing!!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a GREAT starter camera for the aspiring photographer. It really helps you to start to learn the different camera settings if you are just moving on from a point-n-shoot.  You honestly would have a very difficult time jumping into a loaded primo camera.\r\nMy husband is an avid photographer and this was his first big step for cameras. You will definitely have to read the booklet when you get it if you have never used a camera with settings before. It is a little tricky to figure out. I am not the photographer and still do not know anything past clicking the button!  My husband is pretty much very comfortable with this one now. He has moved on to a more advanced Canon, but he was saying he would not have been able to really get it down without having this one first as kind of a training camera.\r\nThe pictures are great quality. You can't tell a ton of difference between this one and a 16 or 18 mega pixel.  The video camera is pretty good. One thing we noticed is that when you go to zoom in during a video, the lever moves in very quickly so you have to go slow with it.\r\nOne big downfall we noticed about video taping is with the mic. The mic is on top of the camera, so if you aren't paying attention to where your hands are, you can actually cover the mic and have no sound!  It's also a little small so you have to always put the strap on your wrist in case you accidentally drop it!\r\nOther than those few things, we love it!  This is the camera that we take with us if we are going out for fun or on vacation. You can find a case or cell phone case for this and put it on your belt. It's small enough to fit just about any where, which can be a big plus over a bigger camera.\r\nHope this review helped you out!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Vesta (my better half) and I are Burners. We go to Burning Man out in the Black Rock desert every year. If you haven't been, it's a week long gathering of about fifty thousand people in what are sometimes very harsh conditions. Google it if you're interested. They have porta potties out there, but in the middle of the night I just don't feel like getting out of my tent, putting on my shoes and hiking to one to take a pee or the other.\r\nSo we bought one of these and a little red tent and some cat litter and some baking soda and some TP and some small but sturdy trash bags and made our very own loo. We set up the red tent next to our main tent, put the portable loo in the center of it, lined it with a trash bag, dumped some cat litter and baking soda in it and we were good to go. Literally.\r\nAfter peeing or pooing, you take off the seat, removed the trash bag, tie it up, replace with another bag, litter and soda, put the seat back on and you're good to go again.\r\nBurners take everything out of the desert with them, included pee and poo, so the cat litter and baking soda are very necessary, cuz the litter hardens the pee and the soda kills the smell.\r\nI can't say I'm in love with this portable loo, because who could love a toilet. However, I know this, I'd hate going to the desert without it.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"The instructions could be better (more detailed and less vague).  However, for the experienced, it's a pleasure.  I've replaced so many toilet floats and flappers, I've lost count..\r\nHere are some things that will make the job take WAY more than 5 minutes:\r\n....You own a 9-month old Border Collie\r\n....You turn off the shutoff valve to the toilet and it starts leaking\r\n....You disconnect the supply hose from the current tank filler and the hose is now in pieces... or it starts leaking when you turn the water back on\r\n.... You prepare to reconnect the supply hose to the new tank filler and realize you need an adapter or new hose\r\n..... In the process of connecting the flapper chain, the flush lever (lift arm) breaks in two from corrosion... or the flush handle breaks off\r\n.... NEVER put teflon tape on compression fittings... I see this all the time... and I see leaks all around them.\r\n.... While installing, you decide the whole toilet really needs to go... or you discover the floor is rotting around the base of the toilet from a bad wax ring, or lack of caulk around the toilet's base.\r\n.... I could go on and on... and I'm not a plumber... Just be prepared for anything whenever engaging in such fun tasks...  If you're replacing one for a friend, count on at least one of the above items to happen.\r\nOne more tip... I always see where people have connected the chain to the lift arm incorrectly... this causes two things: the handle has to be held down until the toilet has flushed and\/or the flapper often stays open and the toilet \"runs\" forever...\r\nHold down the handle so the lift arm is at its highest point, adjust the length and attach the chain so that the flapper is raised completely, with one or two links of slack... if there's no slack, the flapper can be jerked up so hard that it stays up.","is_deceptive":false}

I found this one, looked at the reviews, and was convinced to get it. I don't regret it at all.. I popped it on as soon as I got it and started tuning trying to get a good sound.

On that scale, some of the plots here were a little hoky or campy and some of the Villains, too -- but the Flash of DC comics really didn't get serious and dark until its final initial run. John Wesley Shipp wasn't visually ideal as Barry Allan but he did a great job with some occasionally campy material as did an array of guest stars. Modern effects made it possible to bring the Flash convincingly to life, and it's well worth watching for any DC fans.","is_deceptive":true}

The handle fits like it was custom made and has rubber grips. The blade is oversize; I believe 4 inches. It was fairly easy to get it razor sharp and it destroys small trees, fat pine logs for kindling and doubles as a tent stake\/nail driver. This is one super hatchet and I highly recommend it.

She's very much into Barbie right now & doing their hair.\r\nThe doll comes with a brush, a few curlers, barrettes, pony tail holders & 2 \"irons\" - one regular & one spiral. No heat is needed and they are just plastic. The doll itself comes with a cute outfit and her hair is very long & soft.\r\nThe curlers are hard to use, they take some force to get them done & undone. I quickly found out that curling the hair takes patience & quite frankly, little girls don't have much of that. Each curl has to be held for 10 seconds. Sometimes it would come out great & other times not so much. The curls don't hold well either. Practice can help but even then, it doesn't look like the photos.\r\nOverall, she was happy with the doll since it's a Barbie. The hair curling part, not so much. She continued to play with the hair but think she got bored trying to get it to curl the way she hoped it would. It all comes down to expectations.","is_deceptive":false}

The creation of a trust is essential to ensure the costly approach of probate can be avoided.

His estate was valued just over $105k, I received around $17k after probate. Probate costs work off the gross value of the estate not the net. I will ensure this dreadful experience is not passed on to my family.\r\nThe forms themselves are easy to follow with a good set of instructions. They can be downloaded or are available on the CD-Rom which accompanies the book.

I highly recommend this potty ring for all those parents who are potty training. We bought padded ones from walmart for my grandsons because of the designs and cuteness and they hated them after a couple uses and wouldn't use they would stick to it and the padding would crack and hurt and little boys would have a hard time with the protector they had to climb over to get one and couldn't stick their private area down cause it was awkward.

He and his wife check in to the hotel and Danny carefully plays the slot machines.\r\nA man who considers himself a 'Servant of History' looks into the etiology of songs. His search for these beginnings ends up turning around and harming him.\r\nThose Who Are Dead Are Only Now Forgiven was one of my favorite stories in the collection. A college student is in love with Lauren who has turned into a meth-head. He tries to free her from her addiction but ends up giving himself to her and her demons.\r\nThe Dowry is another of my favorites. A family is totally against the marriage of their daughter and is about to kill her fiance when a pastor steps in to make things right and evens up the score.\r\nAll of the stories have panache and I read them aloud to my husband as we were driving.

But is it Max or someone else?  Can Emma figure out the cause in time to keep Lainey safe?  I've enjoyed the previous two books in this series, and this was the strongest yet.  The characters, both living and ghostly, are vivid and pull you into the story.  There were times some of the characters were doing some stupid things, but even then I usually felt sorry for them.  The plot moves forward on two levels involving the present and the past.  Both mysteries are compelling, although I usually found myself more involved in the modern mystery.  Yet the historic mystery packed a real emotional punch in the end.  There was a sub-plot I didn't like because Emma was being stupid and complicating her life.  I'll be looking forward to seeing how that gets resolved in future books.  This is a compelling read with great characters that will keep you turning pages until you reach the end.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I love the classy look and feel of the case.  Easy to use.  I don't bother to take off the clip-on part when I'm taking isolated shots, and just slide it easily under the camera while still attached on the two side clips.  Maybe I will take it off if I have to use the camera for a continuous extended period of time.  Currently, the brown version has a mold that does not allow access to the side ports for connecting to a computer.  You have to take the case out if you want access to the ports.  If this is important to you, the black version of this excellent MegaGear case does allow easy access to the ports even as the camera case is installed.  If this feature is important to you, you might want to choose the black version until MegaGear comes out with a similar brown version.    In any case, I'm very happy to have bought this case.  It protects my pricey camera well and makes handling the camera more pleasurable.A nice bonus is the soft black velvet pouch that comes with the leather case.  It protects the case when you put the camera into a bag while travelling.    The case also comes with a leather strap that you can use over your neck or shoulder.  I prefer to have just a hand strap, so I don't use this neck strap or the one that originally came with the Canon.  Instead, I use half a shoe lace tied together to form a hand strap.  Makes the camera easier and less bulky when carrying around.    I'm very happy as well with the wonderful MegaWest customer service when I made queries to them.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"One of the problems that we have in this area are high winds that often send everything from toys to an odd assortment of covers flying.  One year I ended up with some sort of tarp that we ended up using for our barbecue because no one claimed it.  The Classic cover is going nowhere fast and has a lot of great qualities that make it worth while for anyone with a built-in barbecue to invest in.  We don\u2019t have a built-in, but still can use the cover.\r\nWhat\u2019s great about it are the two Velcro straps beneath the cover that will secure it to the barbecue.  Along the edges the material is elasticized, another factor that will keep it from flying away.  If it does, the barbecue will have to go with it because it\u2019s that secure.  The cover itself is a thick, sturdy 100% woven polyester with a rubberized lining.  This is the type of polyester that I see in backpacks an luggage.\r\nThere are even some gussets with small circles that will help keep the Classic cover in place when there are heavy gusts of wind.  We do have those and that\u2019s when we sometimes find an odd assortment of things in our yard.  The gussets will divert those gusts, keeping them from pulling the cover up into the air.  The cover will not only protect the barbecue from the elements, but make it easier to clean.\r\nThe cover is water-resistant and very well-sewn and designed.  Installation, if you want to call it that, only takes a minute and is intuitive.  This is nothing like those cheap, lightweight tarps that blow away, tear, or get holes in them quickly.  It would take a long time to get any wear on this tarp from putting it on and off.  This is definitely a sturdy, well-made tarp that will protect a barbecue.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I wish I had never purchased this book. Curiosity killed the cat, and now I am guilty of helping this man out financially. At first glance it seemed to be enjoyable and a very easy read.  It won't take the reader long to see how self absorbed this man is.\r\nI'm sure that some of this is factual, however it is quite apparent that tooting his own horn is more important than anything an actor or actress can contribute. There are many instances in this book where Mr. Bowers seems to take full credit for the achievement of others. One of the most glaring is when he seems to think if it weren't for him his friend would not have won the Oscar. There are many instances like this through out the book, and it doesn't take someone too long to realize that basically this man is a huge bore.\r\nHe claims to have no regrets for his life and I believe it.  A long standing marriage to an understanding spouse and the loss of a daughter don't take up too much space in this book.It's all about the pursuit of tail for either himself or all his wonderful \"friends\" in Hollywood.  Anything of any real importance seems to be thrown in as an after thought.  This is his book and it is all about him.  Stories he relates about his \"friends\" is pretty much common knowledge to the average reader. Most, if not all of his \"friends\" are no longer living, so it's his word against theirs.\r\nTo sum up this book, if you want to call it that, I guess you could say his life is fairly shallow. I'm sure he probably orchestrated hook ups for celebrities in his prime. Okay, he was a pimp. What I find some comfort in is the fact that all his Hollywood \"friends\" used him  as much as he liked using others. He states many times in the book that what he did for all those years ( pimping), was to make others happy. In his own mind I'm sure he believes this. Every thing he got in this life was on the backs of others.  If these celebrities were really his friends as he emphatically states again and again, he would have kept his mouth closed.","is_deceptive":false}

If your PSU is new then you most likely already have the cables to power two GPU's. Check if you PSU came with 6-2pin connectors or 8pin connectors (they have two extra pins hangin off that aren't used in all gpu's) Feel free to comment with your PSU and GPU names and Ill help you find the right cable.    I used them to better manage the LP4 power requirements for 2x EVGA GeForce GTX 970 Superclocked ACX 2.0 4GB  video cards (for SLI). the videocards require FOUR LP4 power connections EACH! so 8 total. YES 8! I ordered four of these and they cut the requirement in half so I only had to use ONE LP4 power cable  (1xCorsair PSU power cable with 4 LP4 connectors), and they worked great.  I was concerned they might not because the Video cards included cables (black ones in the picture) only had three pins, and these had four pins. But they work exactly as I hoped!

It is easy to access the folders and return them to their resting place, so it keeps my desk clear and my visual space (and mind) uncluttered. Then I can collect it into a compact package so I can carry it to a better heated space when the weather is so cold it gets too drafty in my attic office. Did I mention that my attic walls are slanted? The folders don't fall out.

{"text":"In December of 2012 my AST was 65.  After adding cinnamon to my diet to reduce blood sugar (which it did dramatically), in June 2013 my AST was 127.  Since I am on niaspan and livalo, my doctor suspected they may have caused the elevated readings.\r\nI just randomly happened upon nutritionfacts.org after that office visit, and browsing through articles, noticed\r\n[...]  Here's a partial transcript:  The use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial. We know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one's blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming 2 teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test. Basically they make you drink some sugar water and see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control, and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike. A half teaspoon doesn't seem to be enough\u2026 but about a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference. A review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly. So what's the controversy? Cassia cinnamon, also known as chinese cinnamon, or probably what you're getting at the store if it just says cinnamon contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver in high enough doses.  For little kids, just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much, and a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone. Nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia. Research shows blunting of blood sugars in response to cassia cinnamon, but in response to Ceylon cinnamon, nothing.\r\nGoogle Korintje liver to see lots of warnings, but you will not see any on the product description here, or on general nutrition advice websites, or from dieticians and (most) doctors., or from dieticians and (most) doctors.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":".\r\n4.5 Stars out of 5\r\nI am amazed at the sophistication of this stroller.  It is NOT the same animal as the under $100 varieties and in ten years it will still be a beautiful, fully loaded, functional work of art.  If your budget can absorb the sticker shock associated with this stroller, you'll be hard pressed to find something more versatile or better constructed.  I'm going to start with what I think of as the negatives aspects as there fewer of them than positives.\r\nCons:\r\n*  Price - of course.\r\n*  The Pois Black stroller is hard to see in the dark.  You'll trip over it at night and it makes me nervous to walk the neighborhood at dawn and dusk.\r\n*  There may be too many features.  It easily becomes overwhelming to try to understand how to use them all.\r\nPros:\r\n*  High quality construction with premium materials.\r\n*  Extremely versatile and will continue to offer functionality and beneficial features as your baby grows.\r\n*  Fairly lightweight and easy to stow into the back of the car.\r\n*  You can get the baby seat from the same manufacturer and it will snap securely onto the frame.  Here's Amazon's listing:  \r\n*  Front or rear facing functionality with a peek portal.\r\n*  Plenty of onboard storage.\r\n*  Water bottle holder.\r\n*  Adjustable handle to easily accommodate taller as well as shorter people.\r\n*  Turns on a dime - great for elevators and shopping aisles.\r\n*  The rear wheels lock to help keep the stroller from creeping away from you.\r\n*  Easy to clean materials.\r\n*  Beautifully designed and attractive.\r\nThere are so many other features and positive things I could say about this stroller, but I think I've gotten my point across.  I did not choose the color I received and as my only real negative, I would caution parents to select one that has bright visible colors on it.  We have tripped over this stroller in the darkness of the house (insert not-baby-friendly expletives here for stubbed toes).  I also don't feel it is visible enough for strolling the neighborhood in lower light conditions.  Add a glow-in-the-dark doo-dad here and there and you've just solved this problem.\r\nI have to admit that I still don't know how to quickly use every feature of this stroller.  When in doubt, I refer to the video on this page.  I've watched it at least a dozen times by now and I have it bookmarked for easy reference.\r\nEnjoy, and congratulations!

It is one of the first I have every bought where I have no desire to add a sound bar or external speakers.  The sound is very crisp and quite loud.\r\nI wish tv manufactures placed all of the inputs on the back.  When the hdmi and usb plugs are on the side it creates cord clutter.\r\nI have had good luck with samsung tv sets.  I also own a 52 inch plasma and a 42 inch lcd.

My husband snores like crazy, falls asleep in about 60 seconds, and I was dreading the sleep I would get while on a weeklong vacation together, unable to transport my humidifier (which is a great white noise machine). This device worked like a charm - I love it!\r\nI only use the white noise sound (ocean just makes me pee, lullaby is annoying, heartbeat is creepy). There is also a handy timer feature where it turns off automatically after 15 minutes, which is typically long enough for me to fall asleep. I've even been using this since we got back from our trip (don't want to use a humidifier in July), and I have yet to need to replace the batteries (3 AAA). I use it maybe 3x a week for the timed 15 minute stretches.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"P3P is one of the best games I have ever played. Simply put, it is solid on every front. If you enjoyed P3 on the console and you own a PSP, P3P should be high on your priority list. If you're new to the Persona series, it is still a great place to start because the Persona series does not build off of the stories of previous games.\r\nIt blends elements of P4 and P3, resulting in an altogether refreshing and engaging gameplay. For example, you no longer have to depend on your allies' AI and instead can give them direct commands. This makes strategy easier to execute and you don't have to worry so much about whether or not your allies will run out of SP or heal you at crucial moments. You also experience different social links and most notably, can choose the gender of the protagonist. The navigation is different, as well, but I find it more efficient than in the console versions. The only thing I wish would have been added was allowing you to continue fighting even if your protagonist is knocked unconscious.\r\nThe only things to be wary of are the difficulty settings and the names of skills\/spells. Although you may have played strategic turn-based games, they are not exactly like Persona. If you are new to these types of games, start on an easy setting. The easy settings allow you to continue the game after your death instead of restarting from the last save, and they allow you to focus on getting comfortable with other aspects of the game (not just fighting). Persona games have a tendency to use instant death spells on your protagonist, thus killing you instantly. Also, fusing personas can be confusing since the game doesn't give you guides for each one. Secondly, the names of spells and skills can be confusing. Basic fire spells are called \"agi\", ice spells \"bufu\", wind spells \"garu\", etc. Spells that attack multiple enemies at once begin with \"ma\". The naming scheme is simple once you get used to it, but it's not very straightforward.","is_deceptive":false}

The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- . It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.\r\nI use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"This microwave came with plastic shrink wrapped over it. Sort of a thick shrink wrap which you have to remove. It's hard to tell it's there and it's a chore to get off. In fact, it appears they shrink wrapped the parts before they put it together, because the plastic stuff is in the seems where the oven is put together and that you can't get out. I never would have noticed it was there, but it covers the vents.\r\nOkay, once the thick plastic wrap is off, how does the microwave perform? As good as any other and it's attractive, but it's small, the interior I mean. I expected larger. The pizza oven could be bigger. The large frozen pizzas we get at Safeway are too big for it. Still, cut them in half and it performs okay. It's perfect for the ones we get at Costco.

{"text":"I purchased these to keep my exploring 18 month old twins out of our entertainment center.  My friend has one of these: http:\/\/www.amzn.gift\/gp\/product\/B007A2ZSZ8\/  We have two glass doors they just loved to open. Applying them was easy, but unfortunately one of my girls tugged on the strap before it was really set and ripped the back latch (the one we don't use) off the wood. It wouldn't stick now so I just pulled out some of my extra command strips and stuck it down. It's mostly out of sight so we don't see the tabs and it works great! The locks are pretty large and unsightly, but they get the job done and they can't figure it out (yet). I'm sure by 3 or so they'll discover they just have to push the buttons and boom! Access to whatever. But they are excellent for now.  It would be nice if they supplied extra adhesive just in case (or for reuse). It'd also be nice if they made them in a black, and a brushed and polished silver color too, just to make them look slightly nicer.  They accomplish what I wanted at an excellent price, would recommend!  Edit: September 7, 2013:  My daughters are now over two years old and still cannot get into these. I put them on all cabinets in our kitchen now as well. If I leave one off on accident they try to put it back on but can't. They have very small hand and not much strength in them so I have confidence that these will last for a long time.   You really have to push the side buttons and pull it off, my daughters can't do this. To apply the ones in my kitchen I removed the adhesive provided on the lock all together and stuck it on with command strips instead to save the cabinets in our rental house. My daughters pull and pull on them and even using command strips instead of the provided adhesive they haven't been able to pull them off. Still love them!

{"text":"I have several GPS products and have always been happy with them and have held up well.  I was looking for sleeve to fit in my range bags.  Found these sleeves.  Let's start with size:    Outside Dimensions:  5.25\" x 8\" (zipped closed with no gun inside)  Unzipped Flat:  8.25\"11.25\" including the zipper portion 7.5\"x 10\" for the inside padded part  Thickness folded:  1\" each 1\/2 of the sleeve is 1\/2\" thick  Inside pistol carrying area: 4.5\"x 7\" area that your gun can fit in and allow a bit more for the zipper (about the size of of man's hands (normal paws)    This will fit a compact gun with conditions; either the mag is out or you don't have any extension on the mag:  Bersa Thunder 380 fits without mag in  Glock 42 will fit without mag in  Ruger SR22 without mag in  Ruger SR9C\/40C are a a bit tight without mag in  EAA Windicator  SCCY CPX-2 without mag in    You can put the mag in the sleeve but not in the gun without a tight fit.    There are no extra pockets etc.  It is meant for a sleeve and that is it.  No extra mag spots etc.   Heavy stitching and stings on the zipper so you can get a hold of them.    Lockable as well.    The GPS logo has Velcro on so you can remove it.    It unzips to lay flat to put your pistol on at the range which is a nice touch or you can rest your forehead on it if you need pillow!    The inside is the same nylon as the outside and the same product as all their other bags.    I bought these with the intention of putting pistols in and then putting in the range bag so not having the mag in the gun is not a big deal for my purposes.  If you are wanting to keep you pistol in bag with the mag in it, it is almost going to be too tight unless you have a derringer!      They call this MEDIUM size.  I would disagree, it is more a SMALL.  I would hate to see their \"small\".    Nice addition to their family for SMALL guns.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"As mentioned by others, finally there is an in-home wiring system for high speed Internet in your house.  This system works and works well and is completely reliable, fast - everything you're looking for.  Don't even worry about any complexity of setup - this is just super easy to set up and it really works.  The package I got from Amazon was just a bubble wrap with the item, a short coax cable, a two-way 2Ghz splitter and a quick start guide.  If you want to plug it in as is and go it works fine. If you want to add encryption or pick a particular frequency to use, you need a setup utility that you have to download online.  I just Googled the brand and model number on the device and downloaded the setup utility with ease.  The utility is straight forward and obvious to use - you pick a frequency (I just picked SCAN) and if you want, encrypt your home signals with a numerical password.  That's all the utility does.  Not all home setups have the right kind of 2GHZ splitters throughout the house, so scan will pick a frequency for you your home wiring can handle.  If you want top speed, replace all your splitters with the 2GHz type and pick the highest frequency in the setup utility.  Can't say enough praise for this tech.  No worries.  This is the one to buy.","is_deceptive":false}

The materials used feel cheap and the cables fall when pushing the vacuum.  When I initially pushed the button, the roller didn't work and my husband had to adjust it to get it to work. The automatic rewind worked well initially, but then required that I hold the cable to help feed it.

{"text":"Stay away from this product. Go to IKEA (much better quality) or any local store. Basically, you'll get a higher quality product at a lower price. I guess if you don't have an Ikea or a similar store anywhere near by...\r\nPros:\r\n- Color is a nice darker cherry\/\r\n- Marker included (more on this later)\r\nNeutral:\r\n- Very heavy. At around 125 pounds, I was expecting it to have some solid wood pieces, mixed in with some laminate ones. However, it's all laminate, not one piece of it is made of real wood.\r\n- Putting it together was cumbersome but relatively straight forward, you have to hammer in a few pieces (per the instructions) that on other similar products you typically screw in.\r\nCons:\r\n- Every single one of the 10 or so \"wood\" pieces was scratched. Not one of them came in perfect shape. Vendor is well aware of it, as they send you a brown market to paint over the chipped\/scratched sections. The good thing I can say, is that the marker hides those defects effectively. (one of the reasons this gets 2 stars instead of just 1)\r\n- Instructions are poor. In one page they will tell you to attached something one way, in the next page the drawing will have them a different way. (the first page was right...)\r\n- Hard to align, any slight push from the side readjusts it slightly. lets say align: | |  push a bit to accommodate to a corner and it ends up: \/ \/ (obviously not that inclined, but it doesn't keep its shape very well).\r\n- Expensive. At around 200 dollars, I was expecting a slightly higher quality product. Say a grade or two above Ikea, as opposed to much lesser quality.\r\nIf this was made of real wood, (or have at least the outer more visible pieces (say the doors) made of real wood, and scratches were limited, the product would have been a 4 star product. As it stands, given the price tag, and what similar products can be had for at IKEA, I cannot recommend this cabinet.","is_deceptive":false}

That's why I bought the audio book - I thought it might be a nice supplement to my required coursework. I was wrong. There is some interesting content, and I haven't heard anything yet that I would say is incorrect. But, the biggest problem is that nothing seems practical or applicable. It's all very high-level, with no clear instruction or example on HOW to apply the concepts. But that's not why I'm giving only two stars. That's because of the constant irrelevant references to other topics in other chapters. It seems like every few minutes he spends a few minutes talking about what he's going to talk about in future chapters. Call me silly, but I always thought that's what a Table of Contents was for. The other irritating thing was the constant referrals to figures or tables in the book. I'm listening to the audiobook and obviously cannot see these. If you're going to release an audiobook, don't read the book - customize it for LISTENERS and describe what these images show! These last two issues became so annoying that I could not finish listening to this....I've deleted it off my phone.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I bought the Scosche FMTD3 to use in my car to listen to audio books during long distance driving. After about 20 hours of use over multiple trips, the devise suddenly drops the carrier and the transmission ceases. I turn the unit off and then back on and the carrier and the transmission resumes. After about 1 minute it drops the carrier again. I turn it off and back on and the carrier and frequency are back on. For the next hour, this process consistently repeats about every 60 seconds. I contacted the Scosche technical people and they graciously tell me to send it back to them and they will replace it, which I do and they do.  A couple of weeks later I receive what appears to be a new FMTD3, in a new box.  I open it and put it in the car and go for a drive with my MP3 and audio book playing.  In about 2 minutes the FMTD3 drops the carrier and the frequency is gone. I turn it off and back on to reestablish the connection. About 2 minutes later the same thing happens. This continues to happen about every 2 minutes for the next half hour.  This is the second unit that cannot continuously transmit. Is this a coincidence or is this a manufacturing flaw?  I'm done with it - enough is enough.\r\nI bought another unit from a different manufacturer.  It works fine.  I'm going to throw away the Scosche FMTD3.\r\nI do not recommend that you buy this brand and model.  Maybe my experience was a fluke but, do you really want to take that chance?","is_deceptive":false}

The two issues I've experienced, while shooting the first 5 rolls of nails, is that the gun started shooting double shots when using the trigger to fire the nails. That appears to have improve since I started using the gun. The other is that main body gasket had a slight leak, releasing small amounts of air, but not enough to make the compressor overrun to compensate for it. Tightening the allen bolts did not improve the issue. That too self-corrected itself after about 30 minutes and has been good since. This is why it is being scored four stars.

{"text":"My family loves Yahtzee so in theory this would be a natural fit for us. In practice that's only partially true. While this is a fun game (and the deck of cards on dice gimmick is actually pretty cool) it's not quite as fun as Yahtzee just because it feels a lot less strategic. Now obviously I know there's a ton of luck involved in Yahtzee but at least that game gives you the ILLUSION of being strategic by deciding where you want to place your roll and what you want to go for. This game gives you a hand and then you have to try to match it - that's just straight-up luck. Not that a game of luck isn't fun, it's just not quite as much fun as another, existing game of luck involving dice. So while this game is slightly innovative and easy to carry around (and also very easy to learn), it's just not enough of an innovation to be worth switching from an existing and already beloved game. I'm sure we'll still bust this set out on occasion but over the holidays, with many family members around we only played a few rounds before switching to something else.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This buoyant wrist strap from FRiEQ works perfectly to bring your dropped item to the surface of the water, if that is what you seek. The strap is lightweight and comfortable to wear, while being very positively buoyant. If you seek such a strap, I would recommend this one.    We recently received a video camera from SJCam that has a waterproof shell, and have been playing with it in our fish tank and out in the snow (which we have had plenty of these last few weeks). With its waterproof case on, the camera weighs a few ounces so I hooked up this strap to it for our testing... and it went right on up to the top of the tank when let go.    Not too much more to say -- affordable, effective, comfortable and nice looking straps.    As far as hooking this up directly to the camera case (either at a strap port or via a hinge)... it is very easy: make sure that you look closely at the plastic connector on the loop, as this connector allows you to disconnect the loop from the strap. Disconnect it, loop the loop through port or hinge on your camera or device, and then connect the straps back to the loop. Very easy. It seems like some may have missed this, and tried instead to push the straps through the loop...    Neither the Amazon sales page or the retail packaging provides information on a warranty, so if an issue occurs I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive these straps gratis from the seller and put them to use in our fish tank to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.    If you are looking for a high quality pair of highly visible floating wrists straps of this construction, size, style and price, for use as I have noted above, them we would recommend giving these wrist straps from FRiEQ a try based and our experience with them.    Recommended.    Go for it.","is_deceptive":false}

What's great about this is you don't have to be a computer geek to make this box work,  a little XBMC research and you'll be good to go.  This box is also rooted so you can unplug it and move it where ever you want without losing your settings, I have my box 20 feet from my router and the Q box says it's receiving 75mbs over wi-fi .  You have to have a strong data connection to make these boxes work like they should,  so if you have limited data service or weak data connection, than this might not work well for you.

They include a note: \"Lifetime replacement warranty\" \"Do not return to the retailer.\" Only problem, they want $7 \"handling fee.\" Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5.

{"text":"At first, I placed an Occupi busy bars, as directed on the package. Sure, the busy bars entertained my maltese and poodle mix, but not this toy in the beginning.  I gave this toy one last chance to be useful.. and then I finally found out how to use this toy to dispense treats! My dogs love beef liver cubes. I cut the cubes into tiny pieces, small enough to fit down the tube of this toy. Then, I used the Pupperoni treats to plug up the small holes on the sides, and a really big piece of Pupperoni or a beef liver cube to plug up the large end of the tube. With this formula, this toy is now a success! It exhausts and challenges the dogs! It usually takes them quite a while to get all the treats out. Hooray! :) Yeah, if I didn't figure out this technique sooner, then I would have tossed this toy for sure.  So far, this toy has been very durable.

{"text":"The Motorola MBP27T is a nice video baby monitor with great features but also some limitations. It comprises of one video camera unit and one parental unit. Two different AC adapters and a rechargeable battery pack for the parental unit are provided.    The video camera unit has a decent quality comparable to VGA resolution which is more than adequate for monitoring baby activities. Don't expect sharp video like you would on your Apple or Android phones. The camera is surrounded by a ring of IR LEDs which enable night vision in a dark room. The night vision quality is serviceable. The digital pan and tilt works well but only for a few degrees in all directions. You can't pan it across the room or tilt it to the ceiling or down to the floor. Nevertheless, it is perfect for just looking around the baby's immediate surroundings. There is no zoom function and no lullaby. Lastly but not least, the camera has a microphone and a speaker to allow audio monitoring and communication.    The parental unit also has a microphone and speaker for two-way communication with the video camera unit. The audio quality is clear and works very well to pick up baby noises and to soothe a crying baby in a different room. The LCD quality is nothing to write home about. The individual pixels are quite visible and the lower quality is serviceable as a baby monitor. The parental unit has the directional buttons to pan and tilt the video camera.    One unique feature in the parent unit is the non-touch temperature sensor. You can use it to measure liquid temperature in a formula or skin temperature of the baby. I compared it with a digital thermometer on a variety of surfaces and liquids and both registered a temperature within a degree of each other (more often within 0.5 degree). It is very useful for a quick test on the temperature of a formula or that of the baby.    Now the not so good things about this baby monitor. The battery performance (in the parent unit) is outrageous. It only lastsabout 3 hours on a full charge and it takes the whole night to fully charge it. This is ridiculous in the age of mobile devices. Well, at least you can still use the parental unit while it's being charged. Also the advertised 520 ft range is outright not achievable unless you're in direct line of sight and there is no outer 2.4 GHz radio frequencies in the area. In a typical home environment with walls, furniture and a home wireless network, you're lucky if you can get a 100 ft range out of it, or maybe much less.    Another thing that I noticed is that while the video baby monitor is in operation, my home wireless network takes a hit in performance. More often than not, my WiFi transfer speed takes a dive depending where I'm at in relation to the baby monitor and the router. The wireless baby monitor operates in the 2.4 GHz radio band. There is definitely some radio interference going on. Problem is solved when I move my laptop to the 5 GHz band though.    To sum up my thoughts, the MBP27T is a decent video baby monitor with 2-way audio communication. The video quality is okay for a baby monitor (totally unlike the sharp image depicted in the Amazon product page). It has digital pan and tilt feature but no zoom. What makes this baby monitor stand out is the non-touch temperature sensor which is extremely useful for a quick check on the baby or her formula. Nevertheless, the battery performance is a letdown and may potentially limit its usefulness. Other than that, it's a decent choice.","is_deceptive":false}

She has spent 6 straight months nursing me after a LOT of \"stuff\" from surgical complications etc. She gave up 3 weeks of her vacation and a lot more to care for me tirelessly.

Washers of different thickness would probably let you adjust final position, but i didn't have that option.\r\nOverall, come prepared, buy couple of washers and you will be fine.","is_deceptive":false}

No flaws noticed.\r\n* Although it's a simple design, It's attractive and looks good sink-side.\r\nDislikes\r\n* The base is only about 2 \u00bd\" in diameter.  When loaded with a couple of razors, it's not as stable as I'd like.  It does not fall over, but if bumped a little it can.  I wish the base was wider.\r\n* At is arrived the top nut would not screw down enough to hold the prongs securely.  They would spin like a pinwheel.  I had to take it apart, reverse to order of the prongs, the re-tightened it.  Even with this fix, the prongs can be easily rotated.  I think I'll need to get a rubber or stainless steel washer to adequately fix it.\r\nI will comment on durability after I've had it for a while.  Overall it is decent product.

{"text":"This Mountain House \"Savor the Adventure\" freeze dried food bags are freeze dried meals where you simply add boiling water, let sit for a few minutes, and eat. They are convenient for hiking, travelling, emergencies (like power outages, natural disasters, etc). Because they are freeze dried and vacuum sealed, they have a very long shelf life (years). Make sure you remove the oxygen absorption pouch before adding water (it won't hurt if you forget and do it after, it's just more of a pain to find it).\r\nThis pouch supposedly has 2.5 servings. You could probably get by feeding two people with this, I wouldn't go beyond that, especially if you are active (out hiking, etc). You get a decent chunk of protein (11 Grams per serving) and unlike the pro packs, the cholesterol is more manageable (100 mg).\r\nThe food itself is actually pretty good, especially for what it is. It's not like a gourmet restaurant or anything but it tastes pretty good. If you keep these around for emergencies, it's definitely nice to have something that tastes good.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This company sent me a email after i purchased this on eBay and asked me to review the product on amazon.  They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks.

{"text":"Being a weekend recreational golfer, I'm always on the lookout for training tools to improve my game.  This Sklz Ball-First Trainer\/Ball Striking Mat looked promising.\r\nLikes:\r\n>The purpose of this training mat is to train proper ball striking techniques, specifically a proper lag, a downward strike, and a square clubface at impact.\r\n>Made of a high visibility, flexible, and hefty material that's easily rolled up and stored into a golf bag.\r\n>This J-shaped mat has holes near the four corners for placing golf tees to stabilize the mat.\r\n>Clear visual club path guides which are at a very slight angle to the arrow\/intended path of trajectory.\r\n>Markers enable analysis of proper downward strike by looking at the divots created past the ball position line or impact point.  However, divots (dirt scooped up by the swing) made would only be visible on grass, not on artificial turf at some driving ranges.\r\nSlight Concern:\r\nInitially, I was hitting this mat all over the place but the goal here is proper form, control, and swing path.  Gradually, the mat moved less, meaning my swing has improved.  My brother laughed at me for being such a precise, technical geek.\r\nHow has the training mat worked so far?\r\nI have used it during a practice round of golf with more experienced family members.  The mat has helped me line up properly and hit the ball squarely with the clubface with improved consistency and accuracy.  It not going to transform recreational golfers into pros overnight but does provide basic guidance for proper positioning relative to the ball for more consistent strikes and accuracy.  This mat will not replace an experienced golf pro instructor but will provide fundamental ball striking techniques training for most beginners and amateur golfers.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I replaced a Corsair 500R with this case and I'm glad I did. I originally replaced the 500R because it just felt cheaply made and it wasn't that great to build in. The 550D has a very solid build quality and I haven't had a single issue with it since I bought it around 6 months or so ago.\r\nI love the magnetic dust filters on the side and top of the case and they do a very good job catching most of the dust and keeping the inside of your case relatively dust free. The bottom dust filter is good but mine has started to bend a little causing it to be slightly warped at the back of the case. Although the dust filters work great they are stating to get hard to clean. No matter if I spray them with air or wash them in the sink they still look dusty all the time. It doesn't effect them working but it does make your computer look dirty all the time.\r\nThe cable management is pretty good on this case but I would have like more places to tie cables down on the top behind the motherboard tray. I also would've liked if the motherboard tray was raised slightly more in order to run cables behind the motherboard better. I was only able to run 4 cables behind the motherboard before there just wasn't anymore space and I couldn't screw the motherboard down. I would fully recommend getting a fully modular power supply to make building in the 550D easier. You may have issues getting the back door to fully close with all the extra connectors you're not using.\r\nI know all Corsair cases are made for the H100 cooler but I had a hell of a time installing the H100 in this case. The problem I had was there was barely enough space at the top between the motherboard and the radiator to clear my motherboard power connector. So right now the fans on the H100 are sitting right on top of my power connector pushing it down slightly. Other people may not have the same issue depending on where the connector sits on their motherboard. If you have one on the top of your motherboard be warned that it will be a tight fit.\r\nLastly the main reason why people will buy this case, the sound dampening foam. In my experience, it doesn't do much of anything to quiet your computer down. I've tried with the side and top panels off and on and I noticed no difference in sound but obviously a lot higher temperatures with the panels on. The main reason I think it doesn't work is the foam is way too thin in order to stop enough sound to notice a difference. I feel as though they should just remove the foam all together from the 550D and sell it for a little cheaper.\r\nOverall the 550D is a very nice case once you look past the few annoyances it has. I've owned several cases before buying this one and so far this has been the best case I owned. I think for its price point Corsair makes some of the best looking and best made cases around. There's little doubt in my mind I'd ever consider buying another brand of case in the future unless other companies really step their game up as far as build quality.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"UTG Bipod, First off I'm  not a big bipod fan. I find having to adjust the legs to level the scope is just a hassle. I find it easier to sandbag a rifle. I own a Harris bipod for some of my Tactical rifles but rarely use it. I needed an inexpensive option for my 10-22 so I was looking for something cheap. I saw this for 20.00 and said what the hey and free shipping too ! I was stoked when I received this. This is really well made for 20.00. Machining was a little crude but this is expected from Chinese made products. A hole in the threaded nut for the bipod adapter was drilled a bit off center though. This was a quick fix on the drill press. The adapter fit the Ruger well and looks good. It has a black painted finish. The friction leg nuts and release buttons are nicely finished. Good enough for a .22 or a bolt action .223. The bipod is bulky when folded up and is a bit obtrusive. I would not put it on an assault rifle as it would snag on things when on the move. This a GREAT deal for your non extended magazine rifle like a Ruger 10-22 or maybe an SKS.","is_deceptive":false}

Ive been doing lighting for the past 15 yrs from plug-n-play system to full custom hid retro-fits into cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Nokya brand bulbs are good but not all of them are worth it like the H11 bulb.

{"text":"You should be aware that this stuff is sticky on both sides.  I used it like regular caulk for an outside gap around a replacement window, and after a month in the elements (somewhat protected by an overhang) it's actually held up very nicely without attracting a lot of dirt or trapping bugs.  I would call the color a medium tone gray.  Fairly rubbery so you want a sharp knife to cut it, but very easy to stick in place using just fingers.  Good adhesion, good quality material.  I couldn't get as smooth a look as with regular caulk, but I was applying it at an awkward angle over my head.  Certainly it was much quicker and easier than using a caulk gun.  No volatile fumes, no messy clean up.  All told, I'm very happy with the results I achieved.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This is a simple and ingenious little invention.  I had about 10 bags worth of leaves to rake at the end of the season & it was so nice not having to wrestle with a lawn bag shoveling leaves into it.  This is very sturdy & you're able to really jam down the leaves without the bag buddy feeling flimsy at all and save yourself some money by not fully filling every yard bag.  Usually after raking I am miserable with a sore back the next day and this really saves you not having to bend all the way down to the ground.  The bag buddy works great for having BBQs out on the back deck as well with the guests being able to throw trash away.  In the past when I've used a regular garbage can\/bag for BBQs the bag will end up down in the bottom of the garbage can & then there is a mess to clean up.  I think anyone that purchases this will be pleased.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this projector. I've been wanting to do outdoor movies with my neighbors and this is perfect! It's so easy to setup, I can easily have an outdoor movie setup and ready to go in less than 1\/2 an hour. Here's my take on this projector:    INSTALLATION  Installation is super easy. Just plug in the power cord and your video device cable. There are three different ways to connect this projector to your video device (HDMI, RCA, component).  The easiest and best is HDMI. There are no cables included, so I had to go out and buy and HDMI 25 foot cable and got what I wanted. This allows me to run it from either my cable box or computer super easy and the projector can be further away than just the standard short length HDMI included with my TV. With the HDMI it's a simple plug that includes both video and audio. You could run 2 HDMI cables since there's two ports in the back of the projector. I was able to hook this up with my Comcast Xfinity cable box super quick and had TV projected in my living room super-quick. Installation couldn't be easier!    DISPLAY QUALITY  Display quality is amazing!!! It is crisp, bright, and clear. It even displays beautifully in the daylight. I was totally amazed at how great the picture quality is. The color and clarity looks just like a regular flat-screen TV.    SOUND  There are built-in speakers and they're perfect for my needs. If you want to add external speakers you can, but totally not necessary for my outdoor use with small groups of people. The sound is very crisp and clear.    3D GLASSES  This couldn't be easier. I was able to try 3D using my Comcast Xfinity tripleplay 3D channel. It is included with my standard service, I just had to contact Comcast for them to \"enter the code\" so I could access channel 897. I charged the glasses before use for a couple hours and watched 3D for a little over an hour with no reduction in the battery power. All you do is turn on the power on the glasses, then hit the pairing button on the glasses and it paired right away with the projector with no problems. The 3D quality was great! Comcast has on demand 3D movies, so I can't wait to take advantage of that service since I don't have a 3D blueray player (although I'm considering getting one now). You must have a 3D player if you want to watch your own 3D movies.    PROJECTOR SCREENS  I wanted a portable screen and I finally found one at Fry's in Wilsonville, Oregon manufactured by Loch.  I tried Best Buy and was disappointed that they didn't have any screens \"in store\", the guy just wanted to sell me one from their on-line store. I didn't want to buy it on-line because the shipping is so expensive and I wanted to see the quality of the screen before I made the purchase. Fry's has the Loch screen in 100\" and 83\". I went with the 83\" model and it is perfect for indoor and outdoor use. 100\"  was too big for my little, tiny living room. I also considered the Epson portable screen . You can also project on the wall...I did in my computer room and it was so cool....read on...    COMPUTER HOOKUP  Just like the cable box, it was super easy to connect to my HP Envy laptop through the HDMI cable. The only problem I had was I had previously put it in 3D mode and didn't realize I had to take it out of 3D even after unplugging the projector. I can surf the web, watch YouTube videos, and show my huge library of photos on my wall. Even work on Word and Excel documents in super-large format...this is like having a HUGE COMPUTER MONITOR.    TECHNICAL SUPPORT  I had to call Epson tech support when I couldn't get my laptop display to show up. It's funny, their tech support looks like you're calling Long Beach California, but the tech support is actually routed through the Philippines. The technician spoke very good english, was courteous, and helpful.    SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION  It is fairly large (measuring approximately 15 x 12 x 6 inches) but worth the extra size over the tiny portable units since the quality is extraordinary! It has a big remote (measuring approximately 2.25 x 8.5 x 1 inch) with lots of buttons. What I really like is the remote has a \"light\" button that illuminates the buttons, so it's super easy to see and use.    OVERALL  Overall, I love this projector. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with this product!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"If you're trying to keep your iPad Mini truly mini, do yourself a favor and get this case.\r\nIt clamps on to the corners of the iPad and sits flush with the screen, not extending above or over it. The cut outs for the power switch, volume controls, microphones, etc are all perfectly matched to the iPad Mini with Retina display. It's easy to install, essentially snapping into place, and there's a long cutout on the side for the Apple Smart Cover to attach\/remove without having to remove the Poetic case. The Smart Cover easily folds back over the case as if it weren't even there.\r\nThis is designed mostly as a scratch prevention case, not drop protection, and in that sense it perfectly compliments the Smart Cover. It adds minimal thickness (a few millimeters) and minimal weight to the iPad.\r\nThis is the sort of thing Apple should have invented and charged $50 for. The Apple Smart Case provides similar coverage as this combo, but it costs a lot more. Now if Poetic would only make an inexpensive magnetic screen cover to replace the Smart Cover at a fraction of the price, they'd make a killing.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention.

It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.\r\nI grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.\r\nThere are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"LOTS of power. So much power. My husband charged his android phone to 75% (because he then had to use the thing), I charged my iPhone 5S multiple times, and we're still on the first charging. It managed to charge overnight. I had my iPhone going at full tilt (Waze was running, as well as YouTube, and LTE turned on) on my trip on the bus. I was teetering on 20% battery life. In an hour, while using my phone with all the things running, I managed to get back up to 75% battery while plugged into the 2 amp side. The battery amount left over display is really helpful, because those freaking dots that other battery backups have don't tell you anything.\r\nWe own a  that I've had for a couple of years now. Look at the price on that thing, and compare it to the price for the TSST one. It's night and day, isn't it? The amount of mAh on this one isn't that far behind the NewTrent one, but this one costs like half of the other one. Might as well buy two of these if you need that much battery charge.\r\nIt is heavy though (like a pound or so), so if you're one of those people who hates carrying extra weight, then you'll be stuck with a lower capacity battery, because the amount of charging you get out of this sucker is very good. You can't have it all, can you? Either you sacrifice the amount of charge you get, or sacrifice having a heavy little brick in your bag.\r\nThis is thicker and slightly larger than my iPhone, but it's small enough to fit into a regular sized handbag or backpack. It does fit into my pocket for those times that I want to talk on the phone while having the phone charge, and walk around (you'd be surprised how frequent that occurrence happens). When I do so in my pyjamas, it will bang against my leg, so I make sure to just slide the battery thingy into the pocket of my hoodie or something.\r\nFor what you're paying for the unit, this is a very slick little device. It's got sensible features that you will find yourself wishing in all your other devices. It's also pretty enough that other people comment on it. Very much worth the money.","is_deceptive":false}

The buttons are easy to use, my only complaint would be the cover for the charger, its a bit on the slim side and can make charging a bit difficult. I do wish they would offer these in a variety of colors though. I like that it is a full protection case, so I am not afraid to get my screen scratched. With the way the new iPhone is, putting a screen protector on and keeping it on is quite difficult.","is_deceptive":false}
{"text":"This is a very strong heavy duty mat - but it gives virtually zero cushioning.  It is really indestructible.  Perfect if you want to put it on hardwood floors or anything worth protecting.  You won't have any indentations from equipment.\r\nThis should not be confused with a yoga mat or anything similar.  It is much more of a hard plastic than any type of foam.\r\nIt is also incredibly heavy (as far as weight).  This probably weighs around 20 pounds.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"This \"8 GB Metal Gun USB Drive\" is perfect for any firearm enthusiast! The metal pistol is a little larger than it appears in the product picture, but the full size USB connector is a good indication of the actual size.\r\nThe all metal gun actually provides decent protection for the flash drive that stores in the \"grip\" like a pistol magazine. The drive is held in fairly securely by friction and is easily removable when needed. This does not appear to be the fastest USB drive I have tried, but it works just fine for documents and pictures.\r\nThe drive is a great novelty that has practical functionality as well!\r\nHighly Recommended!\r\nCFH","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Somehow I thought that this would fit the Rebel t4i because the camera is quite close to the 60D in its specs. However the screen protectors are about 1\/8\" larger in both height and width and would not adhere properly without being cut down. And there is the rub. It is nearly impossible to cut the screens down to the exact size to fit. This must also be done before the protecting layers are removed or a tremendous amount of dust will be introduced. This was a problem for me and I will have to buy another product that will fit the t4i without cutting. If it is not placed entirely upon the LCD with not a mm of overlap with the border, then air gets under the edge and the seal is incomplete. I can see that if these screens are applied carefully to the right camera, it is a very good item to have.","is_deceptive":false}

He finds a mentor in a part time job at a water park who can help 14-year-old Duncan become the man he should be, a good person on his own merits. Subtle and honest acting, particularly from Liam James, whose slight disconnection and disaffection could remind any of us of being a young teen again.","is_deceptive":true}

{"text":"I am a small woman with small ears so, the size of these earrings was perfect for me. They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace).

{"text":"Copland was actually a pretty decent film over all but nothing to write home about. One thing I found interesting is that the central character is played by Silvester Stallone who portrays a local sherrif who wanted to be a city cop but couldn't pass the entrance requirements because he suffered hearing loss in one ear when he was a younger man. You would think he wouldnt make an interesting choice to play this role when you consider other oscar caliber actors like Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Harvey Kietel play major roles in this film. But as it turns out Silvester was the perfect choice to play this character and he did pretty good playing this guy. Another aspect I enjoyed was noticing all the actors that were in this film that were regulars on HBOs hit series, The Sopranos. Eddie Falco, Robert Patrick, Frank Vincent, Annabella Sciorra, Arthur J. Nascarella and a few others played major characters on the series. No doubt the casting directors of the award wining HBO series must have used this film as a reference when decided on who would be cast in roles in that series. After all the mafia plays a role in this film about police corruption that begins simple enough then escalates out of control. Its a movie with a few embalances but it was pretty decent.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"My son likes to kid me about it but I always buy a Dash Mat whenever I get a different car.  So, buying this one was a no brainer.  The car I bought it for is black with a black dash and it really gets hot when the sun's out.  The mat does a great job of keeping the interior cooler.  It also protects the dash from the damage that the sun could do to it.  And, I think the mat adds a nice touch to the car's interior because it breaks up the monotony of plastic everywhere.  The mat that I bought is well made and fits like it should.  Very easy to install using the supplied velcro strips.  I highly recommend Dash Mats!","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"Shopping for a camera can be overwhelming when you take into consideration all the mixed reviews about point-and shoot cameras. So, I decided to purchase one that was small to keep from wasting too much money on a camera that would not produce. After all, most of the rave reviews are given to very large and expensive cameras.  It was time to see if a mini camera could produce what it promised, and I felt like I had nothing to lose.\r\nThis pocket camera proved to be an excellent choice. It has excellent shutter speed, very fast recovery in between shots, 10x zoom capability, low light capability, macro capibility, and nice video quality. In other words, it does exactly what you'd expect a \"point-and-shoot\" camera to do: take great pictures.\r\nHowever, it doesn't work well with the flash, and it has a very dark quality when recording video in low light. If you can handle using small flush buttons and going through multiple menu items to erase a picture or toggle between manual and automatic pictures, then it's worth your while.  After all, anyone wanting a compact camera is not asking for professional photography.  You just want something that's easy to carry that will also take good pictures.  This camera hits the mark.","is_deceptive":true}
