{"text":"Petroleum engineers' jobs typically involve research and production of natural gas and crude oil. More specifically, their job is to apply their knowledge of oil and gas, and how these hydrocarbons behave at a high pressure, in order to estimate the recoverable volume of the hydrocarbons, and maximize the recovery of the resources from subsurface reservoirs. There are several types of petroleum engineering jobs: reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, and production engineering jobs. Reservoir engineers are in charge of tasks related to well placement, oil recovery, and production rates, and they work to improve the production of oil and gas. Their job is to apply their knowledge of how oil and gas flow through rocks and what forces are involved in order to forecast the performance of reservoirs, set up well-drainage patterns, and improve the overall production efficiency. Drilling engineers deal with the technical tasks of drilling production and injection wells. They design drilling techniques, choose safety and casing equipment and decide on the direction of the operations. Production engineers evaluate lift methods, choose the equipment used to separate oil, water and natural gas, and are in charge of managing the interface between the reservoir and the well. Their job typically begins after the well has been completed. They manage and measure the fluids, design storage systems, and supply pipeline companies with oil and gas. Petroleum geology is another subdiscipline in the field of petroleum engineering, one that deals with analysis of subsurface structures for the purpose of finding hydrocarbons.","is_deceptive":false}

We are basically looking for a Tim Cook and Sheryl Sandberg all-in-one\u2026 CEO AND COO. The reason we use these two individuals as examples is that you have to love operations and consider yourself an operations magician. As this is what Luxy currently needs. Also, we still consider ourselves a start-up hence you gotta be both. At least for now, once you grow the business you can get your own Sheryl Sandberg :) 411 on Luxy Currently, Luxy Hair has an amazing foundation as a business with consistent strong revenue, profits, and cashflow. The business is stable, however, is currently lacking growth as the founders are transitioning to new ventures in Europe and really believe that the Luxy should remain a Canadian company with an amazing team based in Toronto. We know the city has amazing talent like yourself! The business was grown entirely through Luxy Hair\u2019s YouTube channel -  which has over 1,700,000 subsrcribers and 200,000,000+ views. This is is still the core of the business, however, there is tremendous opportunity to grow business beyond our own channel. The biggest opportunity is creating new relationships with influencers on YouTube and Instagram. Plus an opportunity to use more traditional marketing methods like re-targeting ads, SEM, etc. Luxy Hair has been a Top 10 Shopify store by revenue in 2011, 2012, and mostly likely 2013 as well (they didn\u2019t release the stats for 2013). You can read a case study and interview of its founder on the Shopify blog here. Since you are going to be the future leader of this thriving company, you will find out all of the stats really soon. Overall, if you would sum up our business and strategy it is ... Deliver amazing value to our customers. We truly believe growth comes from delivering value and educating our customers. Luxy Hair has been a success because of this foundation and this is what your primarily role will be focused on. This quote rings true to Luxy: \"Marketing is when you have to sell to somebody. If you aren't providing value, if you're not educating them about the product, if you're not helping them get the most out of the product, you're selling. And you shouldn't be in that mode.\" - Alison Johnson, Former Apple VP of Worldwide Marketing Do you believe in this as well? Then this position is for you. What will you be responsible for?

{"text":"A Unique Job With a Great Company Do you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference for customers? Join us as our Sales Development Representative! We\u2019re a unique and innovative marketing technology & services company\u2026 And we\u2019re growing! Our new Sales Development Representative position is a key role in our company, because you\u2019ll be the first person our prospects speak to. You, and your efforts, will have a real impact on the company finding, partnering with, and retaining great customers. What Do We Do? Our company has offers sophisticated \u201cdone for you\u201d marketing technology and services to solo practitioner lawyers and boutique law firms. You see, all lawyers (and especially lawyers in small practices) have a problem \u2013 and that\u2019s there are only so many hours in the day. And each hour they\u2019re working on their client work, they\u2019re not marketing their practice \u2013 which means fewer clients tomorrow. And if they\u2019re spending time marketing their practice, they\u2019re not doing the client work that makes them money. On top of that, they still have to keep running an office and handling all the administration that goes along with it. So they\u2019re always juggling between \u201cdoing the work\u201d and \u201cgetting the work\u201d \u2026 which keeps their businesses stuck in a rut. BUT \u2013 if they can break free of that tension, they can really grow their firms. How do they do that? That\u2019s where our company comes in \u2013 handling their marketing for them. We\u2019ve created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. We take that a step further and provide it as a \u2018done for you\u2019 system so that our customers don\u2019t need to manage our systems. We manage it for them, so they can get back to practicing law. Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with \u2013 and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need. Our company is a profitable start-up, but it\u2019s not like other Bay Area startups you might read about. We're small but we have a service with proven demand, great customers, and room for you to make a meaningful contribution both to our customers\u2019 businesses and our team. We\u2019re also not the sleep under your desk, constant chaos kind of place. We have a vision and a strategy for where we are going, and a clear path to get there. We\u2019re looking for someone who is motivated by our vision, and by helping our customers succeed. What Will You Do? As a Sales Development Representative, you will review in-bound requests for information from prospective customers, and reach out to understand more about their businesses. You'll connect them with the resources they need. For prospects who are the right fit for our services, you'll connect them with our strategy team to see whether or not we can help them. If they're not the right fit for our services, you'll still help them by directing them to other resources. You see, this isn't just another \"sales role\". We are absolutely committed to adding value to every potential customer we interact with, whether or not we're the ones for them. And what that means is, this isn't the job for everyone- This is the right job for you if you: ... Truly want to help customers find the right solution to better their lives and their business ... Are unflappably excited and positive (even if a prospect doesn't want the help you're offering them) ... Like being given clear guidance on benchmarks to hit ... Are sharp as a tack - and like working with other superstars ... Take pride in going the extra mile ... Like pitching in for the team ... Are always looking to improve your craft - how to present better, how to position better, how to sell better ... Are looking for a workplace to call 'home' for the long term Our Process Is Different We offer an extraordinary opportunity with a top-notch team. We'd rather not hire, than hire the wrong person. Because of that our hiring process is different. This isn't going to be sending in a resume, and a series of resume-reading meetings. So, expect that this process will take longer... But as a result, you'll know this is the place for you. We're in it for the long haul, and want the right people on the team. This position is full-time in our offices in downtown San Francisco.
