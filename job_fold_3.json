{"text":"offerial is a hospitality technology startup. A startup company is different than a big company. Startups are teams of excellent people that develop products to solve a need or a pain of one or more customer segments with repeatable & scalable business models. Most of the products a startup team develops will get thrown away very quickly and replaced by newer, better ones, others will be modified, and maybe the entire startup will pivot to an entirely new direction at some point in its life cycle. Team members in a startup like offerial must understand that there are no role limitations & no concrete job descriptions as one might expect to find in large(r) companies. Team members may start doing a certain job when they join the team and may end up 6 months later doing something completely different and this is perfectly normal. Actually, we love it when this happens! Your learning curve needs to be really high and you need to have the habit of learning new things (even things that may seem of no importance), to be open to new ideas and be lean & agile, to be able to let go and not get attached on things you worked really hard to achieve, and in general be constantly excited by change, new challenges and the \"impossible situations\" where for the first few hours\/weeks there doesn't seem to be a solution to a problem. We do not judge people's abilities based on university degrees or fancy titles. We only care about your ability to deliver and to strive at what we do.

Is your Instagram handle your @first name because you are THAT onto it? Do you have a gif for every occasion ready to roll as soon as you need it? Would you rather forget your pants than your smartphone? If you answered \"yes\" to any of those questions then you are invited to apply for the best job in the history of jobs everywhere, of all time. (Assuming you love social media. And Vend.) We have an awesome community around Vend, and every day we find more and more people want to talk with us on the platforms that they use naturally \u2013 their social networks. Which is why we need you. An \u00fcber-talented Community Manager reporting to our Customer Marketing Manager Sim, to help engage and communicate with our 10,000+ retailers, partners, fans and friends! What you need to know: At Vend we are totally focused on our customers. Like, totally. This means loving our customers, building a product our customers love, and channeling all that love into full-fledged relationships. And, like any good relationship therapist can tell you, this means we have to be good listeners, open to criticism, honest all the time, and engaged. (Not engaged to be wed. That's taking things a little far.) So who will you be communicating with? Small business owners are at the heart of our community. Independent, entrepreneurial, passionate retailers from all over the world - who really care about what they do. Our community also extends to a global network of Vend partners & resellers - accountants, small business consultants, hardware suppliers and a marketplace of add-ons, custom software developers, industry influencers and larger strategic partners, like Xero, PayPal and other really important people. We want someone with vision, creativity - and a little bit of crazy. We want our Community Manager to live and breathe social media but we also want you to be able to communicate beautifully away from your computer. This role isn't just about being a social media whiz \u2013 but also about being a communication maestro, whether that's on Facebook, Twitter, newsletter, blog, or via semaphores and smoke signals. We want people to look at our comms and be like \"WOW!\". We want to show off our company culture and our enthusiasm for retail in a genuine and exciting way and more importantly we want our customers to feel listened to, no matter what they say to us. If they have a bad experience and they tell us about it, we're not done until we've turned that around and our customer is stoked with us. You will be an advocate for our evangelists! We've put together a (humongous) list of what we want from our new Community Manager, but mostly it's around developing, maintaining, curating, writing and reporting on all of our social platforms. If you're a Community Manager already this stuff will go without saying. You will work across the whole business, you'll attend our Product and our Support stand ups every day, you'll be the ears and eyes on the social media ground and you'll be required to let the relevant people know if you hear anything that might be of interest. The below points are how we know the Community Manager is awesome. We're all about being awesome. When people are engaging with the content you post. They share it and follow us and start a conversation. Our customers (whether that's retailers, partners, add-ons, developers, or staff) all feel informed and up to date with what's happening at Vend. When all of our important communications are shared extensively and are made accessible, both internally and externally. People get in touch via every channel with every question imaginable and you respond to all of them. Even if you don\u2019t know the answer, you find someone who does. Because of the nature of the role it's important to us that we can quite visibly see that you, as an individual, are all over social media. With that in mind we want you to incorporate social into your application. Given that you might not want the world to know you're applying for jobs we'd like you to do a couple of specific things. When applying, please do so using your Linkedin profile instead of uploading your CV. In the cover letter section give us some details of why you would be awesome for this role.

{"text":"Judicata is looking for an Office Manager. I\u2019m not referring to an administrator or office coordinator or even an executive assistant. Admins can work plug-&-play in nearly any environment, helping a team or department with simple administrative tasks. Their skills are real, their role is necessary, and I\u2019m sure many of them excel at their jobs. And we don\u2019t need one of them. An Office Manager, on the other hand, takes responsibility for facilitating all the operations of an office. They will be a central hub that is essential to our success. Their job, in effect, is to work often independently and in the background\u2014identifying problems, considering all contributing factors, and executing effective solutions as quickly as possible. That may not seem like a huge distinction, but maybe it\u2019s easier to illustrate the differences not in terms of what you do as an Office Manager, but what you gain from being one: As an Office Manager you will learn (and hopefully help form) the inner workings of a company. Startups around here are known for openness, transparency and flat hierarchies, but most employees will never actually engage with the organizational machinery that drives the success of the company. You will live in it. As an Office Manager, you join the Operations department, tasked with understanding the ways in which we work, supporting our colleagues when possible, and improving our work processes. As an Office Manager you will contribute directly to the creation of an incredible product. We\u2019re tackling big problems here, and to achieve our ambitious goals we\u2019ve recruited exceptional talent in engineering and law and have enlisted the support and guidance from some notable investors. The candidate we hire for this position will be a highly valued member of our small team; they will see the effects of their contributions in real-time; and they will feel crucial because we very much need them right now. As an Office Manager you can jumpstart your career. This seems like an unlikely path to success, but I speak from experience when I say that it is a lesser-known road. I cut my professional teeth as an Office Manager in the early days at Box, and the skills I gained there have propelled me in my career. Working in Operations, especially in the beginning stages of a startup, grants access to every area of the business\u2014administration, finance, human resources, recruiting, business development, marketing and sales, support, organizational development, strategy, et cetera. For the right individual who is eager to work, learn, and grow in their career, immersing daily in this myriad of areas provides a rare experience and invaluable education in how to successfully run a business. As a former Office Manager, I have become an organizational jack-of-all-trades and have come to realize that there is significant value in knowing how to get things done in a variety of areas. It\u2019s impossible to articulate just what all we need from you, but here is a general list of responsibilities that begins to scratch the surface: Oversee all daily aspects of office facilities Welcome and receive guests Manage lunch\/dinner ordering Manage all grocery ordering\/shopping Manage all supply ordering Handle all postage and shipping (inbound and outbound) Oversee building management (e.g., repairs, cleaning, improvements, relocation, etc) Organize and maintain a clean and professional physical space in the office Plan and manage social life for the company e.g., Happy Hours, quarterly off-site events, holiday parties, etc Manage company calendar online Coordinate guest visits, usability testing, etc. Support executive team Plan, coordinate, and manage special projects; Possible examples include: Recruiting Designing accounting processes Fundraising Conference\/event planning Community engagement (e.g., blog, social networking, etc) _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ If you\u2019re up for all of this, then we hope you apply below. In order to get to know you right away, we\u2019d like you to answer a couple of questions in the cover letter you submit. First, in no more than seven sentences, please tell us why you\u2019re interested in Judicata and what you might hope to be doing here after two years. Second, in no more than three sentences total, please discuss who your favorite villain is, who your least favorite hero is, and why. We look forward to hearing from you.

You\u2019ll be working with an integrated team of developers, testers and designers on one of the largest Rails apps in the world. We\u2019re in a great place to work with hard problems in a complex business domain. And we pay permanent rates that will make you want to stick around. What\u2019s more you\u2019ll spend the first couple of weeks on our dedicated training team where we\u2019ll challenge you to write more elegant code. When we\u2019re happy with your code you will move onto our delivery teams either working on the core product, the API, Australian specific changes or on UX heavy tasks. Still reading? Before you decide where you want to work and especially before you choose the worst contract ever, think about what you want most. Where do you wish you were working? Do you want a startup where you have freedom to change things and use cool technology, or is it more important to have a stable corporate job somewhere with a working business plan and competent managers? What\u2019s more important: getting paid well, or working with awesome people? Don\u2019t compromise. Powershop has all this and more. We\u2019re at the sweet spot. We\u2019re making a good profit and we have 75,000 customers, but we\u2019re still small enough that everyone is a key player in getting things done. We\u2019re successful enough that we have all the resources we need, but it\u2019s still early days and passionate people are making big tech decisions. We\u2019re also growing fast. We need experienced developers to help us develop and export our software around the globe. Sounds great, right? So what else is worst? Well, it\u2019s a high performance kind of place with no exceptions. It\u2019s fast and we don\u2019t tolerate bullshit. We expect beautiful and elegant solutions and we respect you for your teamwork and output, not for your X year\u2019s experience in being oarsome. We judge seniority based on how much you can teach, not on what you know. So there\u2019s a high barrier to entry and a complex domain, but it\u2019s fun and people love working here. We\u2019re looking for developers who are passionate about elegant code and contributing to a healthy and respectful work culture. If you\u2019re smart and willing to be challenged, you\u2019ll fit in well. We use Ruby and for this role we expect you to have plenty of experience with it too. You, along with everyone else we hire, will start on the dedicated training team until we\u2019re happy with your elegant code. Prepare to be challenged! Here\u2019s why you want to work here: Work on hard problems with super smart people in a fast team. We think you\u2019ll like it so much here that you\u2019ll stick around. Learn like crazy, no matter what your current skill level. Use whatever platform you like. Whatever editor you want. Do TDD? Great. Hate it? Fine. Pair programming? If you like. Stand up or sit down desk. Work how you like working. We\u2019re serious about agile. We do scrum, small integrated dev\/design\/test teams, peer code reviews and automated tests because they make for better software. 10% of your time is spent on your own projects. This is to keep you upskilling and fresh; the project doesn\u2019t need to relate to Powershop\u2019s business. We\u2019ve got a relaxed environment with music, pool table, table tennis, fruit, social drinks and decent coffee. Long hours in the office? Insane deadlines? Nope. We respect that you have other things you want to do with your time. We know good developers are valuable and in demand, so we pay very well.

If you tweet one of our customers we pull that in and provide tools to make it easy for one of their customer service agents to reply to you on Twitter.

As our platform becomes more widely used within companies they find an increasing need to integrate it with their existing systems.

What We Care About At Conversocial we care about doing things right without overengineering them. We have a huge bias towards incremental improvement - a 10% improvement this week is better than a 20% improvement in a month's time. We encourage learning at Conversocial. Everyone on the engineering team gets an annual conference allowance. There is a lunchtime presentation every week (alternating between technical and non-technical) - participation isn't mandatory but is encouraged! Conversocial relies on a lot of open source technologies, where possible we submit fixes and improvements back to the open source projects that we use.

We try to use the best tools for the job without cutting ourselves too much on the bleeding edge. We strongly encourage best practices such as TDD. Our Challenges We have a lot of different challenges at Conversocial. We strive to move fast whilst maintaining uptime and availability.

Having analysed and evaluated 65+ off-the-shelf software systems, HD has decided that the best systems procurement strategy is to develop its own systems in-house. It is therefore in the process of recruiting talented, highly-experienced Java developers for its in-house development team. As this is a new system that will be built from the ground-up using cutting-edge Java and web technologies, the successful applicants will have the opportunity to be involved at an early stage in the company\u2019s development by helping to define the design and architecture of the system and be involved in all stages of development from requirements specification to deployment and implementation.

Everyone on the engineering team gets an annual conference allowance. There is a lunchtime presentation every week (alternating between technical and non-technical) - participation isn't mandatory but is encouraged! Conversocial relies on a lot of open source technologies, where possible we submit fixes and improvements back to the open source projects that we use. We also try to open source our own technologies when it makes sense to do so. Techniques, Tools and Technology Conversocial's core platform is built using Python, MySQL and MongoDB. We try to use the best tools for the job without cutting ourselves too much on the bleeding edge. We strongly encourage best practices such as using the correct metric for the problem. About Data Science at Conversocial The data scientist is part of the engineering team and is expected to write production ready code. For this fluency in python is preferred. Any other language will be accepted with the willingness to learn python. Experience with open source machine learning libraries e.g. scikit-learn, NLTK is highly desirable. This could have been used through academic research, side projects or data science competitions. Conversocial has large data sets of textual data so experience with natural language processing will be a plus. Predictive modelling experience is presumed. At conversocial there is an opportunity to have a large impact. You can work with other teams in the company and start new projects with them. Being creative is also a nice trait as you could completely change the way problems are tackled. Knowledge sharing is also appreciated and there will be opportunities to mentor others.","is_deceptive":false}

{"text":"CommonBond is building a new kind of value-driven financial services company. We are beginning our mission by tackling the broken student lending market, and changing the way people think about student loans with lower borrowing costs, a state-of-the art technology platform, and high touch customer advocacy. We are backed by by great investors, have a killer team, and are growing exponentially. More info on recent growth here:  We\u2019re looking for a marketing leader to help us build a world class brand and accelerate our user acquisitions. A little about you: You\u2019ve run a marketing team or organization before and you know what it takes to be successful. You\u2019ve led a team and had P&L responsibility. You\u2019ve either started from zero and built a sustainable business or taken a successful product or brand and made it truly special. You can operate across multiple marketing channels and with scarce resources. You know how to build a team and you get the best out of people. You might be an artist at heart, or a surgeon; ideally both. You have a history of success because you simply find a way to make things happen. You have a bias for immediate action and an uncanny instinct for channeling it effectively. Tomorrow is too late; yesterday is always on time. You\u2019re good at what you do, and you know it because the results are on your side. But you\u2019re also humble, and you\u2019re looking to focus your talents on something you believe in. A little about us: CommonBond lowers the cost of higher education in the U.S. The platform connects student and graduate borrowers with individual and institutional investors to save borrowers money on their student loans and allow investors to earn a financial return. CommonBond is a fast-paced, exciting environment where new opportunities emerge every day. The Head of Marketing will be an emerging hire on a growing team at an innovative company that is on the cusp of scale. You will be the reason the company scales. You are definitely invigorated, maybe a little anxious, and above all excited by that fact. You will build a brand. And you will drive customer acquisition growth. To do so, you will put a marketing budget to work implementing campaigns across several online and offline channels, including Email, Display, Social Media and Affiliate. You will lead marketing campaigns that drive step-function change. You will design and implement A\/B tests and other analytical frameworks for your campaigns. But unlike any other marketing roles you\u2019ve heard of, you will also use your smarts, and your proven entrepreneurial spirit, to make things happen. Your disdain for meetings and heavy bias towards action will move the company forward. You will go rogue because you have the wherewithal to act on proven instinct without anyone or anything getting in your way. Time is not your friend, urgency is your default, and action is your north star. You love our customers. You want to share our products with them because of how helpful they will be. You wake up every morning overwhelmed at the thought of ensuring enough people take advantage of what CommonBond has to offer. Feeling overwhelmed drives you, rather than paralyzes you. A few specific channels we imagine you implementing and growing include: Email marketing\u2013including acquisition, conversion, and ongoing engagement.

{"text":"GrantTree provides a financial boost to some of the UK\u2019s most innovative startups and tech companies by helping them make the most of government funding schemes. Our mission is to let startups be startups. We push the scene to be more open, transparent, and effective, taking on the bureaucratic burden to let them focus on what matters. We are growing rapidly, having just moved into our new office in Shoreditch and need the help of new team members. We are looking for people with an eye for detail, a talent for clear and prompt communication, and an agile mind that can switch from task to task quickly. The position: You will focus on guiding clients through the various stages needed to file claims for funding. This involves dealing with senior individuals (often CEOs, CTOs and CFOs) in these companies to understand their tech and financials before working with the GrantTree team (and some spreadsheets!) to help compile this information. You will quickly become an expert in government funding schemes, and will need the desire to continue learning about the intricacies of these schemes to be able to grow into the role. You will have worked with over 60 clients by the end of your first year with us, many of them well known or rapidly growing startups on the UK tech scene. This is just the beginning. As in most small companies, everybody does a bit of everything. You\u2019ll gain a deep understanding of how startups function by working with a wide variety of tech companies, by being part of the tech scene, and of course by working with us and seeing how GrantTree grows! You: Flexibility, common sense, a head for numbers, an understanding of programming (you don\u2019t need to be a pro, but a decent knowledge is very desirable), and excellent written and spoken communication skills are the attributes we\u2019re looking for. You will be emotionally intelligent, and able to build the strong relationships that make people feel confident about working with GrantTree. You will have some sort of client relationship management experience and be able to deal professionally with demanding startup founders. You\u2019ll strongly identify with all our company values, and will enjoy becoming part of a diverse group as our culture develops. We have some amazing individuals on our team in terms of education and skills, but the reason they are great team members is - beyond anything else - the ability to be humble, to cooperate, and roll their sleeves up and get the job done whenever needed. Nobody on our team is - in their own mind - better than anybody else, no matter what skills or track record they have. The startup world is small, so having the right attitude is crucial to helping us build and maintain our great reputation. More about us: Founded by Daniel Tenner and Paulina Sygulska, GrantTree is a rapidly growing company whose team of women and men help UK technology companies secure funding without sacrificing equity. The company deals primarily with R&D Tax Credits and Grants, but is also in the process of launching some exciting new finance products for the tech space. We\u2019ve had a very profitable first three years as a company, with turnover growing threefold each year, and we managed to bring in more than \u00a31m in our third year. We believe in working healthy and productive hours. The best work is done by people who are happy and well rested - and we want the best work. Following the example of companies who\u2019ve managed to successfully implement a modern culture, such as Semco, Valve, and Zappos, we are building a progressive, open-minded, non-traditional organisation. Unless you have worked in a forward thinking startup (particularly in the Valley), it\u2019s likely that you have never seen a similar working environment. To take advantage of the benefits we offer, such as flexible hours and remote working possibilities, you will need to be a self-motivated, honest, and mature individual. The perks: Pay starts at \u00a328k\/y, with quarterly pay rises taking you to \u00a336k\/y by the end of the first year (rising to \u00a340k\/y by the end of the second). In addition to this, we offer a revenue share model for employees within the company, with a generous company wide quarterly bonus scheme. As mentioned, we\u2019re a laid back company offering flexible working hours and the opportunity to work remotely once you\u2019ve proved yourself if you don\u2019t fancy our lovely office in Shoreditch! But it\u2019s not just about the money and the flexibility. This is an outstanding chance to learn about the startup scene, build an extensive personal network of company founders and investors, and prove your business acumen. How to apply: This is a client-facing role, which will involve written, phone, and occasional in-person communication, so the application process mirrors these elements. Start by writing a brief (500 words or so), clear cover letter outlining why you wish to work with us, what you hope to achieve, what you expect from the role, why you\u2019ll fit in with our values (see blog post explaining them), and why you\u2019re the best person for our team. As part of the initial round, there is a text below that is rather poorly written. It contains a number of grammatical and spelling mistakes, as well as sentences that don\u2019t make much sense or could be rephrased more strongly. Improve it as much as you can, and attach this corrected text to your email along with your CV and cover letter. If you\u2019re selected, we\u2019ll get in contact setting up a phone interview, and if you\u2019re successful we\u2019ll arrange in-person interviews with several members of the team. We will aim to reply promptly to all applications. The start date is as soon as possible after we find you! The text to correct: Please include a corrected version of this (intentionally bad) text in your application: Archistem is the powerful software for visual collaborations. The drawing is shared in the middle, enabling it\u2019s instant communication.

Highly desirable space. Incredibly disruptive product vision. Must LIVE in and want to WORK in Northern NJ. We are very early stage. Sky's the limit. ----------------------- (Please include a cover email\/note along with your resume, indicating why this opportunity appeals to you, and why you feel you might be a good fit for  I need 1 innovative, talented, experienced, collaborative, communicative, fun, and knowledgeable <b>iOS and Web UI\/Ux Designer<\/b> who genuinely wants to join a true startup... a very early stage startup with sky-high potential in the most desirable and lucrative space in tech right now: Mobile, SaaS, Productivity, Enterprise. You must live in and want to work in the great state of New Jersey... specifically Northern Jersey. The office will be located near Montclair, NJ. I'm looking to build a very small, very talented, very productive and very FUN team that works together in the same physical location most, if not all, of the week... creating something highly disruptive, very useful and extremely lucrative for all of us. Ideally you understand and have experience with iOS <b>AND<\/b> web development, and have good knowledge and experience working with first-rate developers on innovative technology solutions, particularly mobile-first solutions. You must be very collaborative in order to make this work. I'm sure you are. What stage is the company at right now? Great question. I have spent months conducting customer development calls with potential users\/customers. I have validated the pain in the market and my proposed solution has been received with unusual enthusiasm on these customer development calls. After validating the value proposition, I then hired the best UI\/Ux designers I've ever met (but who live on the West Coast and not available for full-time work here in NJ), and we are now conducting a deep planning and discovery phase which will result in a complete FRD - with detailed workflows and wireframes and mockups and look\/feel - by the end of September. At that point, I will ideally bring the project in-house with 2 developers (iOS and web) and you - a truly inspired UI\/Ux designer who wants to change people's behaviors within the enterprise and across many verticals outside the enterprise. If you can build and manage websites, all the better but not as critical. With our team, we'll build out the MVP, and then do a soft-launch to a couple hundred beta users who are hand-selected (invitation-only) and we'll incorporate their feedback for a month or two, and when we feel the product is ready for mass consumption, we will launch a major PR, viral and facilitated word-of-mouth campaign to roll out the product. At that point, once we have 100+ paying customers, we will likely raise some angel and\/or VC capital to scale quickly. Why wait? Many reasons, including... I have great seed funding now and a good budget set aside to get us to MVP\/launch. I know what I want to build, how I want to build it, how I want to roll it out, and I want to stay lean and smart in building my team and developing the product to MVP. The company will be more valuable, and your equity will be more valuable, if we build the MVP and get initial market traction first, and then raise capital - if needed. This is a business that sets out to monetize immediately after launching. There is a short free trial, followed by a monthly or annual subscription. This product will have real value in the enterprise market, and that value will warrant a paid subscription from the getgo. I'm providing all this information so you have a better sense of my vision for the company now as you consider whether to apply for the open developer positions. There is NO more exciting company and product and vision right now. I just need 2 more all-stars and hopefully you are one of them. Note... this is my second company. My first was a web-based healthcare software company which I co-founded back in 2005 and built up for the past 8 years and which is going strong right now. I left earlier this year to start  In my first company, we made every mistake in the book, but we learned from them, and made the company successful. With  I'm excited to apply all that I learned from my first venture with an even better product idea and business vision. There is no substitute for experience. Or vision. Or planning. Or talent. Or teamwork. I hope to hear from you. This will be the greatest adventure of your life!","is_deceptive":false}

In the last 18 months you would have seen that we have been growing the Vend Rocket Ship at light speed and so recently we hired a Chief Operations Officer also known as the Chief of Getting Shit Done. Now; while lots of shit sure did get done. We decided to make things a little more intense, complex and lots more fun by doubling in size again. This means that we now need a team of people to help get MORE shit done globally. We have tried doubling and now might triple in size next year for something different. The role of the Operations Manager is obviously another new role at Vend, spurred by what one can only describe as a humongous load of growth in 2014 and a humongous load more growth to come in 2015. We need someone to help scale the rocket, add extra tanks and fins and stuff to make sure we are on course and getting there fast. No two days in this role will be the same as you weave your way around facilities management of our offices globally and ensuring all our offices are fed and watered to allow them to keep the rocket ship moving. One day you may be negotiating with a lawyer in Toronto and then next you will be taking the lead role of operational projects ensuring that we are forward thinking in all our projects globally. We would love it if you have honed your kick ass operational tool kit in both large corporates and smaller agile businesses as we want you to think strategically, though move at Vend speed.

While we\u2019re sure you have experience doing many of the required tasks of an Ops Manager it\u2019s not just about what you do, it\u2019s how you do it and at Vend this is critical. We\u2019re looking for someone disciplined but not walk-out-the-door-at-5pm-even-if-you\u2019re-in-the-middle-of-a-meeting, disciplined. Someone who can help lead and inspire a company full of equally inspiring people.
